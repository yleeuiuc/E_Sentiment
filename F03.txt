What are we setting the end for?
Fifty thousand?
Unless you set a time or something.
Cos then go.
Every time you go round, so that's five times round.
Cos you got ta set a target now before.
we start.
Yeah, you need five thousand to get up into there.
And then you need ten thousand to get from there to there.
No!
Cos you only have to go round twice cos you collect ten thousand when you pass there!
And.
Yeah, that's easier.
cos it's only a small board innit?
Alright, fifty.
Ooh!
About quarter past nine at!
Got ta go round once before you can buy.
Same as thingy.
Is that the same on all different games?
But even when you go up you got ta go round once before you buy as well have n't you?

You have a go on that.
You can make that and put down as much as you want and then you roll the dice.

Where does that hundred go then?
Oh right!
I think you put it in the middle and then so like.
if you land on a certain square you can keep it!
That's what you do in Monopoly!
If you put all the fines and that in the middle if you land on free parking you can keep it.
Collect wages, two hundred pound.
Ooh ha!
Well away from the wedding!
Mm.
Well you have n't got to!
If you land on it you got ta go up!
Phil used to wait till I landed on the wedding.
That's what you'd like innit Phil?
Pat took home erm.

Yep!
No.
Just.
Dunno!
Fifty thousand we set it up to.
They win do n't they?
Remember I used to go.
up to there, I always used to land on a bloody divorce!
Well we have n't got the cards for that but you can still buy it and I'll give you a credit card or something to use instead.
So if you just use it like that then at least it shows you've got a card.
And you get twenty back do n't you, when you sell them back to the bank or whoever?
Four.
One, two, three, four.
Ooh I'll buy one of them!
Fifty pounds worth of tuition.
Cos I need one of them, that's, what's that, a membership or a no, it's a diploma innit?
Right, I'll have one of.
I need one of them.
Yeah!
Put.
Both dice?
Bloody hell!
Oh bloody hell!
There you go!

That's that one.
The person on your left throws it for you.
Gary.
So if you wan na put like a hundred or something on.
then Gary throws it.
and he can have up to three goes.
Like, if he gets two you lose all of it but if he rolls a twelve you get your hundred pound back plus ten times that amount.
You do n't choose a number.
No.
You just throw it.
Got ta work it out then.
No, you can have up to three goes.
Four.
Lose a third of your investment.
Seventy five quid.
I'd go on it.
But change that.
Oh shit!
Six.
Lose a quarter of it.
You'll probably a twelve!
Plus equal amounts.
So you keep that.
and you get hundred pound of that.
Jammy bastard!

Mm.
