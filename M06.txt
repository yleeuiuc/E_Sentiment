
Really nice.
On the, so I took her for.
Picture on the.
But erm, she just had it combed out, but it looked, she should have had to have it combed because now, I said you would not like it, because it looks too sophisticated and I, I think it do n't look like there's quite I'll get it after him.
, alright I'll get it.
Yes, yes.
Alright,.

The day I came back and I had n't seen.
This is a most strange to hear something like that.
Really, I think she's lost weight again.
And then I saw her the next day and and then I realized the and then I came back home and I told her why does n't she see there's something changed.
And she said yes she's afraid so.
She did n't lose, she did n't lose weight it's something else, and erm, and eh, oh that's why it was, so a.
I approached the.
Alright, that's.
Okay are you ready for the big?
like it?
Really?
Oh I like it.
But it's quite.
It's, it's, it's not in it's like very fluffy, and normally it's much more natural and not.
Not as big, I like it.
It's much more like, you know.
And erm.
Yeah, only one.
Yeah.
I really, I really like it.
Oh.
, and I do n't know why.
Oh she's the one she's a.

Aha.

I think it could be for every day.
Not in the blue.
Mm, no.
It looks like erm.
other colours.
colour.

In the back.

It's a bit like, I'll, I'll, it's very, you know very, it's quite curly I thought, because I really thought she had a perm done, when, when she had it.
And, and, I asked did you have a perm done and she said no.
Oh it's wonderful.
Yes, she does, she has no, not curls, she has like one of those blow er hair driers.
you know with the, with the large,.
It's like a round thing.
and a, and a,.
, I do n't know.
Yes.
, from where they were here as well, as I did weeks ago.
No not yet.
Nice is n't it?
What is the name of the castle again?

Very nice.
Yes.
Very nice, plain and nice.
What'll you call them underneath this?
Peonies.


Aha.
Yeah please, but not very many.
I'm, I'm, I have a problem, a kidney problem.
Yes I, I, you know when I went home, I, I, felt very, I felt quite tired and eh.
not very, very well.
But I went to the doctor.
And, yeah, well, about a month ago.
And I so I, I went to the doctor just because I did n't go, had n't gone for a while.
and I wanted to, and eh we had done my blood taken for all kinds of tests.
and erm, I have what is called a.
A, it's some.
with the kidney, so I have too many proteins in my blood.
No, cos I'm not allowed to eat any milk products any more.
And no meat.
Well some meat, but I'm not allowed to a lot.
So eh.
Protein.
So erm, and so, I had to go to,, I had to go to the bathroom to the toilet very, very often.
About every hour or something like that.
So I thought it would maybe something with sugar.
Yeah.
sugar er you know.
That's the thing I.
should n't have because I'm.
But erm.
But, no, it's my fault, because before I, living on the.
, I, I heard a programme the other day, they just saying that should n't drink too much milk or something, you get the high.
Well, that's, you know, that's a that's not too good for you,.
Well I watch I drink, I drink two pints a day, I always drink two pints a day.
, two pints a day.
You know, normally, not, not always, but.
, but I won, you know.

So erm, so now I have to be careful, erm, but I'm, I'm very much better.
Much, much better.
Well that's excellent of your compliments, although I do n't really know at the time, so.
and then I.
I could see that when I did, you know,.
No I'm fine.
I, I could feel that I have, I had to go back to the bath to the toilet quite often.
If I drank a little and.
For.
I had erm, chicken, fish and a lot of vegetables and fruit.
Yeah.
But my dog, my dog went into the lake.
Yeah, he went lake, and then the next day.
Oh.
He made me all wet.
A.
it's so, I'm tired.
It's terrible, you know, I'll tell you one thing, I went out with, he did whatever he had to do.
And the farmer.
, had your little bag.
No, I have n't got it, I'm sorry.
Yes, really you know, because, then I, then I looked at, on the other side they er were full of cows and and he would make it that was alright, but he was making sort of very little.
No, never.
I know, because you know, it's not very.
Aha, because it's supposedly, it's not ecologically good for.
So, so the are n't doing here.
Yes, it is.

I do n't know, it's a very nice gathering.

I think the owner of is Swiss.
I wonder now, or is, I'm not sure any more, but I think she is.
Yes, but I think she is Swiss.
I'm not sure though, I'm not sure.
Very old lady, yes.
N I have worked with her on, she is responsible for some artist to do in Belgium and I needed some information on some artist who worked, that was at the time when I was doing eh, P R campaigns for er, Sheba, the cat product, and we needed.
We needed artist who were painting cats.
And she had, she was responsible, I mean she was er, representative for two of the paintings in Belgium so that's why I'm.
Yes.
Yes.
All two, all the two of them.
Yes.
Well he has to eat.
Well then have to hid it from me too.
One.
Nine thirty.
Three hours.
From nine thirty until half past twelve.
The little analysis and communication board.
It is, about comparing political, sociological, economic novels.
Great communications, great.
How can you compare, how can you apply pluralism, imperialism.

or a corporate system, how can they apply to communications?
Okay, so,.
Erm, alright.
For example, when you talk of, imperialism, when you look at, when we, we've study it from a, erm, quite a few, so it means that that capitalism supply.
and, but the problem is, that, although it creates supply it laboured people who worked, yeah.
can not buy it because it's too expensive for them.
So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company, what you could call it period, for example, erm.
Let's.
Alright, let's see the French, mm, mm, mm, yes.
So for example, I do n't know, erm,, let's take an example,,, the French, erm multinational, tele telecommunications.
National.
I have n't.
Multinationals, they have erm,, doing much better abroad than it is doing in France.
Because the French can not always buy what.
so that's why it's only period.
Well you can call it export too, but export is.
That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known, and, makes itself sell at much a than in its, in its own country, so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower, most European and have a monopoly tower.
in not only Holland but in Germany.
Belgium.
And so when you, so it means that the Dutch are leaders, so it's, it's kind of, that's how putting up the communications empire.
In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is.
Broader than all over Europe.
That's why it's called imperialism.
So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire.
Yeah.
The power.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
And then erm.
Aha.
But it's nice you know Brussels.
Erm what did we do yes, well we went, I, I went to Isobel at what, I found her at three, we had.
We even gave her coconut to the dog which I which was nice.
No, no, yes my dog.
No I do n't think so.
No because it's another one, not the usual one.
So, then we went to.
I went home.
On Saturday afternoon we had tea at five with erm, Andre and.
Andre and.
And they.
Yes.
I'm fine, no.
I, I did play.
Yes.
No.
No, no.
My brother drove me.
No.
Yep, I hope it.
The youngest one.
, because, though he is in the army, he's doing a masters degree in Brussels as well, at night, so it can be done.
Yeah.
they get him free time, so now he's had two weeks off.
for study.
But he'll have to two more weeks then afterwards.
Michelle is now in the, second and then erm, he might go to Switzerland to study.
The second year.
In accountant.
very quickly now.
But erm.
That's fine, well I have to, to make a, have to write a little letter and, and, that's.
And I was n't sure of the work any more, but.
No, no.
No, it's quite a apart.
It's much harder, I mean I simply, Swiss German, than Dutch.
cos I practice more it.
No, I, I really.
talking.
But do n't you think that.
he would come back quick.
Aha, aha I told myself, I had to force myself not to.

Common?
Common.
No it's too.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes,.
I know you're right, now it's imperative with one and it's with two.
Writing I do n't, I do n't think she'd, she can write it there, I do n't know.
Italian.
Well I think she uses it quite often, you know, I mean.
at the office, or the Italians come, she always uses it.
Well, when there are, I mean, I think, well I think it really con I mean, when I'm with the Dutch I really thought the other day I can till David comes back again, quite quickly.
Mm.
Same when I'm, when I'm in Italy, I, I ca n't speak Italian very well, but when I'm there a week, I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar is n't perfect, I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me,.
I, that, for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish.
Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins, you really ca can in my, you know in your.
You'll pick it up.
And I really understand Italian quite well, and eh, when I had Spanish, I, I suppose.
All the time I had, I had Spanish.
And when I had to speak, I spoke Italian.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm, mm.
Yeah.
That's very funny, for example, I went Dutch because when we were small my brother run away.
He always, well we not always often, very often, spoke Dutch with each other.
Yes, because of, we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends, so we then, and we mostly spoke Dutch and now, since I, so it's nearly, since now seven years have been, since I have gone to States, first year in eighty three, came back in eighty four, and since then we've never, ever spoke Dutch.
We always speak French to each other.
Oh.
Yes, with my mother and my father.
when we could n't, when, when we were not allowed to in the States.
But now it.


Really, I really like it.
It's very nice with the plants on.
Very, very nice.
The grass, the garden.
Looks nice, and erm, how do you call these erm, ah.

Looks nice.
Yes.
It looks nice.
Right.
Yes.
Okay right, right.
Put away my things.
Cos he was a man.
Oh you have to, oh you ca n't leave him alone one second.
Oh yeah, at night, anyway because at night he's alone and he's from it and during the day, I know, I know my brother as I ca n't rely on the, and, and, you know, and look at, Michelle would look at, at him all the time, but, put, put the thing on you know.
And so erm.
I tell you I take off when I go out now, because, everyone looks at you.
Laugh, oh they laugh, oh they are funny, they even they have to explain it and we did n't.
And it's quite dangerous, because it does n't hear very well, that, when you're behind him.
Where are you?
And eh.
Doors we can have them painted,.
He comes into the door, he comes into the door and it's like.
I went and all the way.
Except for the hotel which is the most wonderful walk hotel.
Beautiful garden,, my mother and I said very well you, we will come for week here but we wo n't go out of this.
Not one.
It's raining.
I do n't know, there's this house, what's falling apart like, and it, it was small, it was like, I think it was wide at the.
Right, so it was wet, very tiny.
and erm, and so, you know we did n't say anything erm, cos he wanted us to buy, so Michelle and I went and my mother.
We only went for two days.
And so, but the surroundings on.
Ah a little small village we have what they call, which is a big.
with, you know they have it in, in the square, it's a square.
And with a glass of cider, aah, wonderful.
It had those little tiny villages and very nice, very nice.
was ugly thing.
The you know it?, very, very, quite chic.
You can see it's quite chic.
And it's not, it's not beautiful.
They have kind of you know, in the back, in that little house,, I mean if you buying you know, it's like, I mean, if I had to go there two weeks in the year, you know what I mean.
So I would like to go there, I would never ever spend more than two days there, in the winter, and if I, except staying at this wonderful hotel.
It's where we had the most wonderful room, in the, in the, my brother Michelle and I we said, you know, we arrived there with my brother had, my father had an appointment with, with the architect at three o'clock in the afternoon so we went too, before.
which is a very nice city, where it's all.
So went to Andre's and had lunch there and went on to, to a, play ball, then er, there was called, and my mother and I had.
Marks.
Marks.
End of Marks.
And then, my mother said one week before and then my mother said, do n't say, do n't say.
I know, I did,.
You know yeah, yeah, I do n't know where it comes from.
So she went with the architect and he was wanting to show us this kind of and we were like, were cold and were back to the hotel, we did n't even go into the house.
And, and, it's was so bad, oh it was terrible.
I mean the house in itself, no, I mean.
Responsibilities, I mean, it would have to be torn down and build up again it was in such a bad shape, it was really, I mean, terrible, it must of been, it was, it was man who lived in since the second world war, alright, so you get.
The, the, there was a very old car,, one, in a beautiful car but there was nothing left of the car, you could n't even.
That's right,, it's a, it's a, so my mother and I said we're going back to that hotel, you know, were very, very kind of luxury type, so we went back to the hotel and my brother and I went into the room where we had a television view on the sea, very beautiful.
It's quite beautiful, because it.
Their ball is tied in a.
So I, and erm, very nice, very nice, and eh, we had a marvel bunker.
Erm, bathroom and so we had some of those for half an hour, so good, and I would I had to, we had to get out, quite a long way too, it's about, it's longer than driving to, nearly as driving to Zurich.
Same thing, seven hours drive, terrible.
No I drove.
My father drove, then I drove.
But I, I, take.
No, no..
No, no, no.
Oh I did n't tell you, the day before he had a dash.
I was not I was not, two hours.
, it's not, my brother dared make the remark on, oh, it time, since then did n't have any accident.
I have my father on the phone half an hour later, erm, erm, when's Phil leaving tomorrow?
Do n't, do n't worry I, do n't tell mother but I had a little accident.
I said no it's not true, what on, door, what door, well the door, is it bad?
Well, you'll see.
The whole door is, the back door.
, I mean a mess.
Like a.

The, the afternoon before he had to leave.
So you can imagine the door and the air coming through, you're driving seven hours, we had put my bro I do n't know what they did at night, because of.
Unrepaired.
We, with four in mine.
So my, oh how can you go through that, with a broken car like that, eh, it's a shame you know, so we had to drive.
So again.
Well it was n't his fault.
Luckily it was n't his fault.
So erm, did something wrong again, I do n't remember whether it touched it, probably nothing crazy again.
And luckily were not the other one, was.
I do n't know, it was his fault and the other one, look like, you know, in the, problem.
Yes.
Or, you know, whatever it is.
Anyhow, so it has been fixed.
and have a nice trip.

So erm.
And eh, that hotel was wonderful, the most wonderful dinner tonight.
Oh yes.
Very.
Yes.
, friends met.
So we decided not to buy the house.
No, I.
Quite.
No, I'd like to buy something.
Ca n't think, well not right in town.
Well I'd like to buy before my dad go retires, because he's in the business as you know, he knows exactly what to buy and if I have to, you know, have work done, he has this erm you know, it does everything.
So, as well.
So I'd better, even if I had to make an and you know.
But I, I really want to have like a even if I stayed in Switzerland, because have mind so.
You know, I'd like to have Brussels.
An apartment, a nice one.
Not big at all, just comfortable, so that it sleeps two or three.

Yeah,.
No problem.

If you want to I'll go with you.

Well I from what I've known.
So eh.
That's, that's what I.
No, no, no, I know it's not true.
I know it's not true, I know it's not, well I know from whom I'm can think it's not true I know it's not.
No because I, no, I well, it's is, I know people who say well I've heard very little and I know that's enough for them to have very good friends.
As I'm not the person to answer you very little to get, I'm get into something quite a lot, you know?
So everyone, everyone has his own.

Mhm, I like it, but I like it like that better.
I like, let's see, I like cut flowers in the house.
much better than plants in the house.
Then in the garden I like, erm plants.

But not as slow as I am,.
I would n't mind eh, I would have.

For, forty five, forty six.
They're going to build eh.
Well, they're, they're not allowed to go too far.
in one block.
But I wonder how high they're going?
A one, ju you know, I mean you have complex of apartments which look and then you have the corner, the big house.
The cabbage thing.

Coming up this way then?
I know which one it is.
No it's not that one, it's the one next to the.
The the one that, I know which one you mean the one that was just renovated.
No, no, it's the one nearer to you.
Right next to, right next to the block.
of the house.
You know, I mean.
That's this, yes see the wall of the house, but that's.
Another wall, no, no, no, no balconies.
Another wall, that's what.
Another lounge.
I do n't know, I do n't, I hope that, no I do n't.
No they ca n't.
And they're not going very far inwards.
That they do have.
it's a supposedly two down, large building whether, cos they ca n't really move inwards.
They're very strict.
But was it too late?
Really?
I do n't know, but there has just been bought.
think so.
Mm.
Yesterday.
Twelfth December, not too long ago.
They had been on the for quite a.
Yes, I do n't think they can go higher, they have to keep on, I'm sure they do..

It's down, see when you, when you look at the.
, you had a built in, and on the left, they've torn down the whole building.
Yeah, I mean, they've torn down the whole building inside the big.
I do n't know what to do.
Well, they're making.
Yes.
Well, the whole corner and.
Well it will, I do n't know, otherwise I think it will give it to the.
No, no, the rest of the building's built.
But, my dad told me, you know, they've put in air conditioning.
It was already broken the second day of.
never ever worked.
I do n't know,.
Second time, now you know when to put.
Which means that here, those metal plates, they came like.
How do we do it?
I would n't of want to go and.
Yes, but why?
Well.
They'll sell another one.
But they have, but I do n't.
Well, she you can always.

something quite plain.
A brochure I think,, now in Belgium where about, there's a list of five hundred houses, which were built by different architects.
and erm, said they were erm, all over Belgium.

So the architect is there to give you.
I do n't know.
Yeah.
have to do all of them, anybody'll think that we're all Belgians.
No I think it's.
now you mean those?
, pity cos I had that too.
In fact it was the, you know like, what these metal, shape shoe.
Something would be sticking out would hit on something so when the wood, your feet in the shoe, that would make a hole in the, in the front.
And that's why.
At first I.
you get twenty five.
Terrible.
Yes, I see.
Yeah.
Man walking.
Well like, when you see them like this, they do n't look.
You know I would be.
Really, oh sometimes, I always wonder if they are or not..

about two years now.
make television reporters.
Terrible situation.
Like to catch something that was hanging on the tree, no one would catch it and hang there.
And minutes and minutes long, and until.
would of hang on to the thing.
It matters if he hangs on to you, how fast did you get out of it?
I, I, I had one with a.
Should of have a one.
During her sleep, what was it?
So you know, she was sleeping, he was laying beside her and he an egg from her hand or something.
I'm serious.
It happened in Germany about a year ago.
Yes, really, and that was.
Her hand.
No, no,.
, well, I, I thought it was quite amazing as well and I could n't.
And, would n't want you to take the recorder, well I did n't.
It's a, it's a mark in her face.
We can use a lot of, of information about.
They're doing a lot of advertising of.
No, I saw him but he did n't.
But he never got up a ref another reference and the kind of a position going on.
Mm, Swiss, Germany.
that they're, no.
So that in the Vatican should allow eh priests to be married.
To marry.
Well I mean it's the first position ever of such sort.

I think well, priests have the.
I do n't think it.
Yes.
Ah,, he has complained now to the Vatican that he, any more, because of, Swiss the community does n't give him the.
the side of the.
They whittle every money from him.
He do n't supposedly do n't have any money.
They tell me is.
I do n't.
He complains to the Vatican.
Because to the pope because that's the only one is still can complain to, the other one is to him.
I do n't think he will be able to, like this for a long time.
Because erm,.
No.

They have a little foot hole.
They and they live with.
We hear all types of stories about the.
, not her.
Oh.
Yeah.
, except for a, you know,.
, well the, it was a.
And then someone took it once back to the, programme on.
For someone took it.
Yeah, there was also, there was.
She, she.
Yes.
Took her to Brussels.
Takes seven to eight, eight hours.
Took me, I was, the, do doing all kind of roadwork on Belgian and Luxembourg highways.
and I was stuck in Luxembourg for at least half.
Just it was twenty seven.
Yeah.
It was doing alright.
Cos I was driving with the window open.
No,.
No there was n't anyone after me.
No.
No, I have n't seen him since the.
Aha.
They're four years behind.
Not special.
Is sometimes if like last night, they have, a very nice production.
Erm, the Marriage of Figaro.
The opera.
Very nice, it was quite nice.
Mm, production by The Vienna.
Opera with.
No, not yet.
Up to.
Well we do n't know very much.
Well he's still with a.
No, there's no.
But it is very, do n't get along very well.
Or any more.
They're er, does n't talk any more.
When there are some meetings or, he puts the reports on the desk of the secretary and.
I do n't know.
Yes, very briefly.
It was the.
Yes.
No.
They're Belgian, and French.
No I do n't think so.
Does, does.
Came with a, a I think.
He's doing well, he had a,, I think he could have been Berlin or somewhere in Germany, it's called.
He is a perfectly created, because his father liked to go to.
Yes.
I do n't know, because they can I do n't know.
No, I do n't know why.
Yes.
I, I do think so, I thought it that it would be.
It's helped a lot of people never see them.
It eh, it, yes we might see them, because the, they call quite.
Yes, but he's going to.
For good.
Yes.
No, no.
Yes.
That's why he's so a little upset.
Thinks he's a little afraid for me that.
So eh, if he wants to be by himself and.
Go his own way.
I hoped you forgive.
Always.
But it is very much, same time.
Later, it's like watching television, he sits there and.
She is?
Yeah.
It's incredible I trouble.
Not to incredible place.
And I have some of her one of her neighbours who, where did you go, I went to Mexico to study.
and now he's touring Rome as well, took advantage of being left in Mexico, travel all over South America and now I think he's going to do Australia and.
Just back in the kitchen.
No I'll do that.
Ca n't we do it?
Hello tape,.
What?
Yes.
Yes, try to.
It very funny cos I want to, yeah, because I I had such a study on, on United States many rating systems or, it'll into those houses like.
And so I, you know some people would have, why I do n't know whether they on they're television so you can and check out what, what they want, whatever.
The is quite difficult to, to work it out and, and analysis these people, you know, when you do n't want to see themselves watching people knowing them to watch Dynasty or Dallas or something, so they on purpose watch very interesting documentary.
But it's just.
I know,.
Yeah, well.
It, it has been, anyhow they're about having the thing and.
And so, well they, sometimes do it,, because it's not very, always they're really on it.
I know.
I have, I have some.
Oh honey I.
Yes.
five, five or six.
There's even one in Geneva.
Mhm.
Yes.
Oh really?
Could n't of been, I have.
Yes.
There's a picture here of.
You've seen it, how often?
So why did n't, and then as well.
It's stupid because I've never really ventured Brittany, so.
I, I do n't know Brittany very well.
So that's why I'd liked to go.

There you are.
Aha.
You.

I think I've got something, it's in between, the one in the middle.
That's the one in the middle..
No.
That's nice.
I do n't think so, I think it's a.
Mm.

Very small it's about fifty.
Twelve thousand Swiss Francs.
Twenty.
Fifteen to twenty.
Hmm hm.
Also depends on the size.
No not always.
Mm.
Hm hm.
Yes.
Hmm.
I want a.
Huge things and beautiful things.
The problem with that painting is that I did n't know if it was a real.
because there was nothing no signature whatsoever.
Nothing.
No no even.
on the back.
Not even on the back.
Many do.
Ya.
He signs, he does n't no.
And not on the back.
But you have a certificate.
Then it's fine.
Uh huh.
So that's no problem is it?
There is some.
But he can put it he can put it on the back.
Artists never give satisfaction.
Because they're artists.
They very sore people, and they're very stubborn most of them so whence they have an idea and ca n't get them away from it very very easily.
it's very hard.
Hmm hmm.
Oh yes you know sometimes an artist says the picture is his and two years later he denies and says it's a false one.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Or yes that's one thing because he does n't like it anymore or he might have had a a problem with selling it to someone or something and just to take revenge or something he says.
It's never been mine.
No.
Yes.
Huh huh.
I think he's probably the most would you not say so?
Yes indeed.
Quite some yes.
We do n't have anything from.
That's a very beautiful.
Yeah.

That's right.
It's incredible.

There's a beautiful.

Hmm but very much like this.
Yeah.
Hmm hmm.
I love them.
I hate that picture.
That's a horrible picture.
No no.
Yes.
Because it's a French speaking.

It's probably not.
It might be.
Very perceptive.
No.
Might be a book.
Yes.
Posters?
The one which is going must be going to fetch a lot this the one with the hat.
Back there.

A work are quite looked for.
Because.
Yes.
Yeah.
At home we have one done by those there by.
And I was so sad because it's it was some water went on it.
So all the time you can see that water on it.
It's too bad because I think we could have fetched about five thousand Swiss Francs for it.
Because it's a nice farm it's a very nice.
It's a very nice one.
Er the printer.
I did the catalogue so I looked all the information up with through the three to do that.
And then we give it to the printer.
In a certain way.
But I have no I do n't know who did decide sure you know print.
It's quite a lot of work to do on this cataloguing.
Because you have to find all the literature everywhere it's printed what the problems is where the printed picture comes from.
The size one that sort of thing.
That you know is very interesting that I arranged all the materials through that you know it's scandalous that's it's carton fits.
Or you do n't.
Sometimes you can but not always.
'Cause you have different kind of canvases.
And er.
No.
Yes.
Very nice peace.
All right right there's one piece that I love.
I have not heard it.
There's more.
That's nice.
Those are very nice too.
Yes I love.
Most beautiful piece.
So well framed in.
Frame looks like you have white glazing on a.
Yes I have been to La Fete in seventies.
Very nice.
Hmm hmm.
Yes?
It's every fifty years or something like that.
Yes?
Or every no every twenty five years.
Yes I'm serious that's something terrific.
Yes yes.
Yeah.
No no every twenty five I think.
Yeah.
Its very'cause I know it is when I was there oh I will be able to see it once or twice more in my life and that's it.
Yeah.
No.
No.
We hoped that we did n't have no we had electric valve er central heating but we have very old central heating.
A very beautiful very high ones.
Yes.
Oh one of the big one huge one.
It's very beautiful because it has gorgon that's called it's I've forgot it.
No not the whole thing.
It's.
It's um cream coloured and there's a a golden design in it.
No mostly Swiss.
Yes.
Except for the biggest pieces.
Yeah.
Yes getting very.
Would you love to have it?
Because they're very rare.
There are only about a hundred made.
Yes.
Special collections.
They were made for special occasions.
we.
Yes I suppose so.
Not always.
Sometimes they were sold in shops as a special limimited edition.
Just as a Swatch Collector's.
Yes really.
I mean now exactly we send out about dunno how many letters to ask if they have anything to sell.
So we the whole collection since eighty three.
Eighty three Sure?
Yeah.
Yeah you have any they have the whole thousands?
No not thousands but.
Yes hundreds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
They can go very high now.
About ten thou I dunno.
The middle one is the is the most expensive.
No I no this one is the most expensive one.
This is that one is seventy eight.
Is not what.
Yes.
See.
they'll they'll be too late.
It's one thousand francs to two thousands.
I even wanted to buy that one and this one too.
When when I when they were out.
Yes I've seen it.
Yes and I know I have one which is totally black with here the caldon.
You know and supposedly it should be worth a lot.
I du n't know.
No.
And then I have the jelly fish which is the totally transparent one.
The problem it's very expensive when it does n't say Swatch and it's all white nothing so it's just a Swatch and so on it's probably not as much.
Yeah.
I have seen those two.
This one I have never seen before.
Eighty nine.
Three years yes.
Yes eighty nine.
Two years.
Hah!
It must have cost a lot at the start but they.
No but those you could n't buy like that.
This was a is an artist who made a special limited edition of them.
I do n't know.
Probably you could buy them some stores have them for maybe a week or so.
They were all sold I dunno.
There's in Switzerland and.
But they must have cost a lot.
I think so.
Well.
They are exactly the same size as the others.
I know but you know we have a serie limit edition is full up.
During Swatch watches.
Yes.
Hmm hmm in Belgium they were.
They were all kind of silk covers with the painting in the middle.
and the they cost at that time the Swatch costed about one thousand three hundred thousand francs and they costed about two thousand eight hundred I think.
No.
Yes those are called.
No.
But some types before in the beginning all Swatches were the same price.
No.
That I know how but I bought it.
At Easter time yes I bought it at Easter time.
And then I amd they said I think that one is worth something.
Hmm hmm.
Mm mm yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
and the one's too late I like that one too and I wanted to buy it as.
Yes no well some countries do n't get.
all.
Yeah.
For example well I don ' know which Swatch really but on Omega up for example there are Omega watches in Belgium which you ca n't buy in Switzerland.
which are only made for export.
For example my dad's brother Omega which you could n't find in Switzerland.
Which was only made for export.
Yes.
Well the market is quite large.
Yes.
I mean the one who bought that you know.
And I would be very happy you know.
No.
I would never give that.
I do n't I do n't know.
I have no idea.
't is maybe over estimated too.
Ya so that if the goes up to thirty thousand the reserve might be large enough to give it to sell it for that price.
For example sometimes they overestimate certain works of art and you wonder you know during the sale you see it's estimated forty to fifty thousand so you think they'll never give it to you for less.
Sometimes a gets up to thirty and then they give it to the person.
Then one wonders why.
It's just because or they over estimated it or it's the price you know.
They wanted to get.
It's.

Hmm.
Hmm hmm.
They have a rally in Brussels starting last week.
But not this weekend but weekend before or is it June twenty five I do n't remember.
No I was n't there I was in Switzerland but it was quite nice because they had carte blanche they have some preview of it you know you had like a band playing.
Giving out some leaflets and they play incredibly well.
On the Grand Place but they play all over Brussels and so you can take the bus for free.
and you go all over.
They've done this for that three years now and they.
One night one even.
Yes I think it.
That's in August.

But yes they.
Yes every year not now, not always no but most of the time yes.
Yes.

It's fun yes.
It's quite well it's fun because I you know the people and you see them once or twice a year and it's it's nice to see them back and talk.
but the procession for us is like the most boring thing because we we just walk on the Grand Place for about five minutes.
and then we sit.
No.
No we only start from the Grand Place and then we sit on the there's a big escarpment on the and then we sit there.
So and it's and most every every single year there's something different but very little.
And so.
We know.
Something like that or one they put in that was n't there or some.
Something like that or yes.
Fighting and that.
Yes they have batons.
Yeah a reception.
In the.
No I'm fine thank you.
Yeah.
Yes I know which one you mean.
Ah I do n't really.
Yeah.
It's a nicer in here than the hall it is very warm.
You know this is very much against this is something typical of the seventies this kind of thing.
Hmm hmm I know because it's back in fashion but this was built initially this was something that you could find very much in thirties.
It was fashion you and you would have bracelets with them you'd never seen and big rings like planets.
I think it's plastic.
Yes I think it is.
Yes.
This is yes.
There might be some very you know I do n't know.
Ah huh.
Hmm hmm.
Hmm Hmm.
They're nice.
They're very nice.
No I really like them.
This one I like.

Very.
It's a wonderful day.

Yes.
I do n't know.
That's it.
Appointed I do n't know.
That's it no.
Oh well yeah tired, I shall sleep.
Do you want me to help you.
That's.
Yes.
Yes I was very.
I was there about five after nine.
I had to wait for about ten minutes.
Socks.
Well I'm doing much better now.
Yeah but just soft strokes.
Yup.
Hmm hmm.
Yeah.
You know what really put everything in the jacket.
Nearly put so I was n't nervous.
No.
Yeah but I you know no.
It comes it comes by bits and bits with me.
All the time it's always like that and I hate that because I'm that's why I'm so slow too.
You know you have people who write it once you know once through.
I ca n't do that.
Impossible.
I've never been able to do that.
So I write like ten lines or something.
Then poof.
I have to wait and see how I'm going to to do further.
Because I have to structure while I'm writing I you know so I'm structuring while and I ca n't write as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I planned a little bit but even if I plan I still ca n't write it.
Yes that's it.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My third question today.
I was I did n't know which question to take.
One or the other,.
which one should I take?
So I decided at least I stood there for ten minutes which one should I take?
You know?
Which is the most stupid thing.
And then I started one and I said no no no I wo n't be able to do this.
And I started another one and I said no I wo n't be able to this and got back to the other one and did the other one..
Hmm hmm.
yeah.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Hmm.
Not much those two here now this week other house.
But next week this.
Well I have much it was much easier for me to study the once.
I have next week.
Also the one next.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This one was hard because this one to me I think was the hardest because it was was theoretical.
and we had to have theory that much you know.
And tomorrow it's hard because it's an economics one and I have never had economics before so but it's the second part in Zurich because it's flying economics telecommunications and political television.
Much more practical so that's all right.
and then next week it's it's easier easier subjects.
So.
Mmm mm.
There are.
No.
Not really.
You know it's the thing you wanted.
You choose and so you like to.
Yes I have interviews and then just need to start well I need some moral interviews and then start.
Structuring.
Finding more readings.
You know and then writing.
Yeah.
Should I drink the pot.
I'll get some.
Do you want some more?
Yeah but.
Do n't worry you stay.

Too nice.
Three thirty.
Yes I know but then.
So er then I wonder how much a weekly one was but it's twenty one sixty a week.
So it's I I counted it up for the time I'm staying.
It's not quite worthwhile.
No it's from Monday to Sunday.
Yes only yes you took it I can take it from tomorrow for a week.
Twenty one sixty.
Again two ninety.
Yeah.
It's incredibly.
Imagine.
It's incredible it's it's six pounds.

Yes it's three hundred and sixty.
That's one way to Minorca.

Do you like the Barbican?
Do you know I think the acoustic is very bad in there.
yes.
It's most wonderful thing.
But so I sat in the Barbican up up at the around at the same level as the Royal Festival.
I could n't hear anything at all.
It's written yes well supposedly there there have been many criticisms about it.
But er.
I did n't hear I mean I could hear.

Yes.
Or, when the, no, when I see, I meet someone for the first time.
I can.
I classify meeting people.
It's a bad thing to do.
Because you do n't, sometimes you can have a very wrong opinion of someone.
Yes I think, well mm.
No, not.
No, I sometimes even now I classify people at first and sometimes come back to my decision yes I do.
Yes I do.

I mean when you compare it to the new one in the which is awful.
So how can they do, and it took about ten years to build this.

to pieces.
And they put the most ugly thing.
