Did you go to see the river yesterday?
Oh.

Has anyone listened to erm what was it, Radio Newcastle?
You've listened to it?
Oh.

It was at the school yesterday, rather.
And er she said that one of them was drying out nicely.
What's happened to my voice this morning?
Can I turn it down a little bit please James?
James?

Jim.
How many leaflets did you say you still had to deliver?
Well.
have you got the leaflets?
Are, are you going to ring Martin and see if you can get some if he's got any more?
I just thought, if it was any good if I took Bryony to the hairdresser with me and you took Richard and James.
if you could get hold of any before I went out, I need to be out at quarter to ten.
Is that any good?
Or not?
Oh.
Okay.
Right.
I just thought it would have saved time.
Still a lot of roads blocked by snow according to the television news.
Yes.
Did n't you see the.
cars ye when Doro did n't you have snow at Lonsdeen?
Dorothy said her lawn was covered with snow when she arrived yesterday morning.
And it was thick on the front of our car.
And you're only a hundred yards from her.
Oh it was th and we saw a well you saw some, who was it?
Erm Richard you were trying to break up a big lump of snow yesterday were n't you?
Where was that?
Yes.
Er, that could have fallen off a car cos it was a big piece and there was n't anywhe anywhere else.
Where else did it say the roads are blocked Jim?
No I meant.
Aye.
What are you reading Richard?
I ca n't see it.
What does it.
Who?
Soccer Coaching.
Mm!
Do you want to be a footballer?
I think your brother is tired this morning Amy, all we're getting from him is nodding.
Was he in a bad temper when he got up again?
Screaming?

You'd have.
to do every single tiny bit.
I know, we've got, we've got hardly any crayons left, I think someone's eating them!
Now are you sure Richard?
You do strange things!
Are you sure you have n't eaten the crayons?
I do n't know where they're disappearing to.
What have you got so far?
Mm?
What do you usually put on?
Well do you want something nice or something horrible?
Do you want something complimentary or something insulting?
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Who wants to be a princess?
Richard do you want to be a princess?
Well.
There you are, we've got a smile out of him.
He must be coming round.
That's right.
Well if I could choose I would go to bed at about two o'clock in the morning and get up at about ten o'clock in the morning.
That would suit me fine.
Er er well, I would read for an hour before I went to sleep.
Yes.
Well last night I went to bed at about I went to bed early last night, I was in bed at half past eleven and I read.
That's early for me.

Cos Jim'll be at work, he wo n't be able to give them a lift in the car.

What have I got in my hand?
I've got a a tape recorder in my hand.
Right, let's have you at the table.
Well, Bryony wants to sit in her own chair today, so you sit on your own chair.
Well she might want to swap later.
You do n't wa.
You do n't want to go on your chair?
You have n't sat in your own chair all this week.
Come on.
Clever boy.
Cos I've got to go out in ten minutes, I'm going to get my hair done and you're going to look after Jim are n't you?
Come along.
Up you jump.
Let's see how quickly you can jump up off the floor.
Let's see if you can jump up.
I thought you'd had yours when you made mine.
I'll make you.

Oh!
Sorry.
I did n't think it was in there.
Let's see how quickly Richard can.
jump up, see if he can jump up before I count three.
One, two.

Oh!

Come on Twinkle, up you come.
Oh!
You're going to have a squawk are you?
Do n't you want this nice biscuit?

Look, there it is.
There it is.
Up you jump.
There.
Right, I'll we'll go out after dinner shall we?
We'll go and see if the river's gone down any more.
See if the swans have come back shall we?
Is it very deep?
That was n't.
Well.
You're not going to go in your own chair?
Well, in that case, wait till Bryony's finished hers and then you can sit in her chair.
Will that do you?
See if we've got there's lots of milk left.
Right.
Well give him it what back?
You've drunken it?
It's, you you've drunk it you mean?
No you have n't.
Are you going to drink yours later then?
I think I'll have to get some straws and you can practise drinking out of th drinking with straws.
Cos they have little.
milk bottles at nursery school do n't they?
With straws.
Quickly!
Look if we do n't be quick it'll be time to meet the children from school before.
we've even got anywhere.
Right, here are your reins Bryony.
Have yours then.
Arms in.
Just put your straps on.
so you can get in the buggy.
Yes you can have the red cover on you, do n't worry.
Have n't even got the buggy out yet.
I did n't.
want to get it out till the last minute in case it rained on it again.
Right, who's next?
You're red!
I no, the door's locked Bryony.
I'm not ready to get the buggy out yet.
I have n't got your coats on, or mine even.
Right.
You stand still.
Good boy.

Where are your reins?
Do n't think that, come here!
Do n't run away when I'm trying to.

Come on Richard.
If you're coming, come now.
No, I want James in the front today.
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Will you be qui yo will you be quiet and listen please.
I want James in the front today because the buggy is easier to tip up with the lightest one in the front.
And.
if it starts to snow or hailstone, or pour down I want to try and carry the umbrella and it's very difficult.
to, push a buggy with three of you in, and hold an umbrella up.
So now do n't vanish again.
You ca n't get out the door James cos it's locked.
Right, let's have the cream on your faces.

Right, let's have the cream on your face.

Stand still please James.
Well do n't you?
Why?

sore.
Alright.
Hey!
Little boys do not sit on windowsills.

Let's have a look at you.
What did you bump?
Show me what you bumped.
Show me what you bumped.

James pulled Richard off the windowsill and sat on his head.
Now come down!
Down!
Now!
You're not to climb up there.
Dangerous.
You will fall on yourself and bang your head on the radiator when you step backwards.
Yes.

I think I'll cry in a minute.
Get out the way.
What's the matter?

Maybe you do n't want to but it'll keep the wind off you, and it keeps raining.
Well you'll just have to cry Bryony because you're going to have them on because it keeps raining.
And, they'll keep your hands warm cos none of you'll keep your gloves on will you?
Right.
Red one for Bryony.

Put your head up straight so I can get this one on top of this.
And then it wo n't come off.
Your hood's up, your, your anorak will.
You do n't want it.
That's right.
That's the way it goes.
Now then, let's see put your feet straight on the footrest so I can tuck these things over.
I'm going to get your rain cover, I can only I've got two hands and there are three of you.
So you have to wait your turn.
Who's been tearing up all the newspaper that the wet wellies were on?
Right.
Richard, let's get yours on.
Oh!
No, you never do it do you?
The other ones did?
It was n't torn up when the other ones went to school.
So I do n't think they did it.
Put your arm up a little bit till I can get this pulled down over your feet.
There!
Is everybody wrapped up warm?
Now hang on, cos I need some tissues in my pocket.
Erm where are we?
I do n't need my purse.
Let's see I need my umbrella my gloves, where have I put the key now?
I took it out so you would n't lock me ou oh, it's my coat pocket.
I'll just put the lock off the gate on the windowsill.
Er I need that piece of paper.
I think we're ready.
I think.
Right, what's stuck to my foot?
A piece of newspaper.
Lock the door.
I've got, yes.
Mhm.
Can I put this bag.
do you think it'll just go on there?
I'll just put it on there like that.
Cos it keeps slipping off my shoulder.
Oh!
I've still got my glasses on and I do n't need them.
I'll just put them in the bag cos I've locked the door.
Yes.
I know you carry it on your shoulder sometimes.
It's a bit long for you.
Oh!
Look at.
I'll have to go back in the house because I've got two odd gloves on.
I've got two left hand gloves here.
Ooh, I am a nitwit!
I do n't know where I go er Right.
That's better.
I've got a pair of gloves now instead of two odd ones.
I'm going to put it o.
I'm going to put it on.
Yes.
Right.
Take the brake off, and off we go.
Are we ready?
We'll reverse out the gate.
Are you going to reverse.
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
Are n't you doing it today?
We're a minibus today are we?
Right, we're in the.
You're in a minibus Bryony.
James said he's in a double decker.
A what?
You're driving a mini.
Yes, you're driving a minibus Bryony.
James is driving a double decker.
I do n't know what Richard's driving.
You're driving a double decker as well.
There we are.
Paul must be fixing his car.
Pardon?
Paul's not in his car today?
No.
I think he's been fixing it.
Not many flowers left on that winter jasmine now are there?
Yes.
It's winter jasmine.
There's only about six left on.
The leaves are growing now though.
The flowers come on before the leaves come on.
And when the when the flowers drop off the leaves grow.
Pardon.
You'll have to talk louder I ca n't hear you, you're all muffled under those covers.
And the wind's blowing in my ears.
Pardon.
You're nice and warm?
Yes you are nice and warm.
My face is cold.
The rest of me gets warm with pushing this.
buggy.
Mm?
You did.
I do n't think it is a Telecom van any more.
It used to be but I think it's an old.
I think it's an old one that somebody's bought to use for themselves.
Cos they've painted the Telecom writing off it.
So it's just plain yellow now.
The new Telecom vans are grey.
I like the yellow ones better.
You like the yellow ones as well.
They're nice bright ones are n't they?
Can you see the sandbags?
Look at those sacks full of sand near the door, near the shop door.
They're called sandbags, do you know what they were for?
That was to stop the water flooding into the shop.
It did n't get quite that high though.
Oh!
What can you see now?
Yes.
That's right, that's a gas van.
Clever boy Richard.
Whoops!
Yes, that's right.
Hello Shirley.
It is, it's a gas van.
Perhaps somebody's having a gas cooker repaired.
Perhaps the gas cooker's broken and they need it mending.
Oh look the boys and girls are coming for play time.
I saw Erin run past and Amanda.
Did you see Erin and Amanda?
I wonder if Martin and Richard are out?
Hello Claire.
Hello!
Hello Christie.
Who's that?
Can you see them?
Look, they're coming out for play time.
You ca n't wave to them can you, cos you're all covered up?
Anyone else we know?
There's Mrs.
Hello.
Mrs said hello.
We'd better go had n't we?
Oh!
It's too cold to stand still anyway for me.
We'll see them when we come back to collect the others.
Wait a minute, I ca n't hear you Bryony?
What pet?
What did you say?
I do n't know what you said.
I did n't hear you properly.
Is that the minibus you're driving Bryony?
Hang on a minute.
This path's all covered in mud look.
It's a plarty path.
Yes it wa you're driving your minibus.
And one just went past.
Did n't it?
Oh, a man's pressed the button we ca n't make it in time.
Another minibus.
And a motorbike.
Oh it's a.
What colour's that car?
I can see an, an orange Land Rover.
It's an electric one, electric van.
Hurry up green man.
He's coming now.
Over we go.
Round the corner.
There look.
There's an electricity van.
It's an electricity Land Rover.
With two big ladders on it.
There.
Look at the trees now.
Oh look!
Can you see the buds on the conker trees?
Look!
They've all opened out.
Can you see all the new little leaves on the conker tree?
I did n't notice them before.
Probably cos we've had to walk with my head down with the rain all the time.
Right, we'll go along we'll go the long way.
Mm?
Oh.
Yes we're going in here, we say that again, what did you say?
What can you hear?
Oh!
That was what you said, what can you hear?
I can hear the.
That's right.
The car wash.
You can see the steam coming from it cos it's hot water.
I can hear the weir.
Listen.
Can you hear the weir.
At least you can see the weir today, we could n't see it on Wednesday could we?
The water went straight across the top.
There was n't a weir there.
Oh look.
It's all bubbling up again.
The water's still flowing very fast is n't it?
It is very deep.
It's very, very deep.
But it's gone down a lot.
I bet there's been a lot ducks ' nests washed away though.
I do n't think there'll be as many ducklings this year.
A lot of the ducks ' nests will have been washed away.
Can you see the sand on this path where the water's been right over the top of it?
What you saying Bryony?
What love?
I wish you'd talk a bit louder I ca n't hear you.
Look, here's another conker tree.
Horse chestnut.
Can you see the leaves?
Wait a minute, I can reach this one.
Look at this one, can you see hang on there look look at the leaves opening, oh, you're too far forward.
There look.
Can you see James?
Up here look.
And, can you see on the end, look that's where the flowers'll grow, the blossom.
They look like big candles do n't they, when they're growing?
That's the beginnings of the flowers growing.
Can you see all the sand on the grass?
Yes, the river washed it all up, right over this path.
Look, we're going through sand now.
Think we were at the beach would n't you?
Yes, it looks like the beach with all the sand across the path.
The river washed it all up onto the path.
Ca n't see the swans though.
They're not at this end of the river.
Yes, I can see ducks.
Ah look!
There's a white duck.
Can you see the white duck?
Straight over there look.
There's a white.
duck.
White ducks like that one have escaped from farms.
There a lot more drakes than ducks though look, are n't there?
Yes, you look.
There's a.
Moorhens?
Where?
I ca n't se.
I ca n't see any just at the moment.
How much time have we got?
Right, we'll go up this way, through the promena along the promenade, and then we'll go back through the town and it'll be time to get the others from school by then.
Right.
We're going for a walk along the river to see if we can if the swans are near the Old Gate Bridge.
See what else we can find to see.
You're having the bag.
Are you carrying my bag for me?
Someone naughty's smashed a seat, look!
Can you see?
A seat's missing from there.
Just the posts at the end.
When Jim and I came along at night time on Wednesday.
there was erm.
Those are drakes those.
Yes.
They're the daddy ones.
There was erm, some ribbons tied right across here sa saying police notice closed.
Could n't go down there under the promenade.
But the river was right over the top of it.
Who left the gate open?
I do n't know.
Oh it's tied up a somebody's tied it back with a piece of string.
What's the dog doing?
I ca n't see a dog, where is it?
I ca n't see a dog.
I can only see a daddy and a little girl on a roundabout.
Along where?
We're going down here, yes.
Right, now this is steep hill so I've got to go slowly and hang on to you tightly so th buggy does n't run away from me.
Whee!
There we are, we're at the bottom.
We have n't seen any moorhens at all have we?
Look over there!
Look though.
I can only see one one duck all the rest are drakes.
One, two three, four.
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen drakes and one duck.
Not many ducks though are there?
They're all daddy ones.
Yes, we saw a white one, that was round near the leisure centre.
Was n't it?
Can you see all the bubbles on the river.
All the white bits.
That's all the air bubbles because the river's flowing so fast.
And bubbling up over the stepping stones and things.
Can you hear the birds singing?
Listen.
Can you hear?
You can hear the birds singing.
Yes.
They're in those trees up there.
You want to go in the tunnel?
You mean underneath the bridge?
I think it's still flooded James.
It was still flooded yesterday.
We ca n't pet, I ca n't get the buggy down the steps.
anyway.
Yes, you've got your coat on.
You need your coat on today do n't you?
Yes, we've all got our coats on.
Cos it's cold.
Look at the wind blowing the trees.
Can you see the wind blowing the leaves?
Yes.
Can you see.
can you see all this rubbish, all these leaves and bits of grass and everything on this wire netting?
Can you see James?
Look all of this, this is where the river came up to.
The wa the water was right up to there.
That's why no one could come along here on Wednesday night.
You can see how high the water is with all all that.
all those bits of grass and leaves stuck on the fence.
There's a bird singing, listen.
Can you hear it?
Sounds as if it's just above us.
does n't it?
Mm?
It has, it's.
all stuck on the fence.
Bits of grass and leaves.
And all kinds of rubbish.
stuck on the fence cos that that's how high the river was.
And there's all those things got washed along in the river, they got stuck on the fence.
And that's how hi you can tell how high it was.
It was right over the top of this seat look.
Even over the back of this seat.
Mm mm.
It did, yes.
Did n't get stuck on here because.
these this fence is, has, has n't got.
netting on it.
Yes.
Yeah, they've oh!
Hey!
I wonder if you can there's a huge tree stuck underneath the bridge.
Oh.
I do n't know, wait a minute till I see if I can where can I, can you see wait a minute, I'll show James first.
Look James.
Can you se no you're too far forward.
Wait a minute.
Can you see.
There's a big tree stuck underneath the bridge.
If you look un can you see the bridge over there?
Underneath the arch of the bridge.
It's a big tree stuck there.
Now, can Richard see it?
Hang on a minute.
Bryony, can you see it now?
Look through there look through that opening there.
You're looking the wrong way.
Let's see if Richard can see it.
It's a huge tree!
Can you see, Richard, now?
Ov that's, that's right.
Big tree stuck underneath.
What?
You were looking the wrong way?
Yeah.
Look, if you look down there under the bridge in the tunnel, look it's still flooded.
Oh!
Look at all the sand, you ca n't get down the sand's so deep.
Cos the river was right up here.
Look at all that sand.
it's left behind!
Tha would make a huge sand pit that would.
Ooh!
Golly!
Look at the state of the path, it's all wet mud.
Never mind.
We ca n't go back again, we'll have to go this way.
Look at the muddy state of the path!
We're gon na have muddy wheels.
Never mind.
A pick-up ca pulling a horse box look.
Oh, there's no horse in it though.
That's a horse box for carrying horses around.
But it's empty.
There is n't a horse in it.
If I can get across this road and the bridge I'll take you over the other side and you might be able see the big tree trunk better.
Hang on, there's a car coming this way.
What love?
Ooh!
It might be a wonderful contraption, but it is heavy!
Yeah.
It's suppo hello.
It's supposed to fit them until they're four, but it wo n't.
It's had the handle repaired three times.
And it's so high now their dad's mended each time, fortunately he teaches technology.
and he's mended it, but er it's high.
You know when I want to turn a corner I've got to stand on my toes and put my full weight on it to turn it.
Oh they're, they're.
they can walk very well.
and they can walk a long way.
but if the weather's bad.
and they want to stop and look in.
every shop window.
which we usually do.
it takes forever to do it.
So.
So this is we yes.
He's fine thank you.
Yes.
He was off for ten weeks.
Yes.
But he's.
he's they put him on erm he went onto ward one.
because it was lighter.
for.
oh about six weeks I think he was on er and then he decided he was well enough to go back to his.
own heavy ward.
Yes.
Yes.
Mind, the election's taking up quite a lot of his time.
He's out.
so he.
have n't seen a great deal of him recently.
And I'll only go when it, the rain's not torrential.
Get fed up being frozen and wet!
Now then.
Look, I've brought you, now you can, now you can see the great big tree stuck under the bridge.
Look at it.
Is Bryony looking the right way this time.
Hang on, till I get the brake on, or you'll run into the river.
Can you see?
Look at that great big tree stuck under the bridge!
It's pulled up by its roots.
By the deep water running so fast.
The water's been flowing so fast it's just dug up the tree by its roots and it pulled it along and it's got wedged in the bridge look.
Yes, it's wedged against.
the bridge.
Yes.
Oh, a digger going over the bridge, look.
Yes.
A digger.
That's right.
I'll just er put you beside this seat for a minute while I check this whatsit.
I've got to check, ouch!
Oh my silly knee!
I'm checking to see if this has stopped.
I'll sit on this seat a little minute while you tell me what you can see.
You can see the tree wedged under there?
I can, oh you can, can you see the duck sitting on the bank?
If you look under the arch of the bridge you can see them.
What can you hear?
Listen very carefully.
Can you hear.
What can you hear?
Hear what?
A car coming?
Yes but listen what you can he I'll tell you what I'll turn you round.
I can hear something else, another sound.
Yes!
Clever girl.
Bryony can hear boys and girls.
They're in school, I'll show you where the school is.
Yes we ca I think these ducks must think we've got some bread for them, but we have n't have we?
We have n't.
No.
They're coming to see if we have though.
And there's a white duck come along now look.
I think it's escaped from a farm.
Yes, a white duck.
That's right.
And there's one other duck that's a mallard duck is n't it?
And all the rest are drakes again.
Yes.
What are green ones?
The ones with green heads are.
Yes.
What are the ones with green heads?

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven drakes chasing one duck!
Poor duck.
They're chasing them.
All the drakes are chasing the duck.
Yes.
They're all chasing the duck.
Ooh!
They've all sat down.
Mm?
Sounds like the boys and girls are go having a good time at play time does n't it?
That's the school that Terry goes to.
We have n't been round this way for a while have we?
We usually go one of the other ways.
Where it's easier for you to walk.
They were, yes.
All of them were chasing the duck but they've all they've all decided to stop for the moment, they're all sitting down on the grass.
I do n't think you can see them, can you see them?
Or is that tree in the way?
I wonder if that's the latest fashion?
All those boys er, over there have got scarves tied round their head like pirates.
They are what?
Pirates?
You think they're pirates do you?
Pardon?
What?
Yes.
It is.

You sit there and finish eating that and I'll wash your hands.
You've eaten it all up?
Yo.

You can hardly close your mouth!
Can you?
You put water in the ceiling?
I do n't want water on the ceiling.
We had water on the ceiling.
Gareth's turned the bath on.
When Gareth lived with us before he got married he turned the bath on and walked away and left it.
Mm mm.
That was a mess!
We could n't have the lights on.
all the water came over the top of the bath.
Had to get the, ladder?
They went years ago.
How long was our guarantee?
Oh yeah!
I have n't even read the papers today.
What?
Do you think it's a real?
It's a whole page spread.
Three at five hundred there.
the last three hundred.
There's no catch.
From such an established reputable company.
All prices are fully inclusive of double glazing the Raid One Security P V C, da da da.
Fittings and all the service guaranteed.
Well I do n't know.
It does n't say anywhere where there's a guarantee.
All Windows in Cheshire.
I wonder if it's the same address as when we got ours?
Unle it's, it's how.
long is it since it was supposed to have gone bust?
I thought it was about ten years.
I ca n't remember.
When we got that, when we had ours it, and er they said if you if you found someone else who would like who would have cold shield you would get er, seventy five pounds back.
And you gave the thing to, who was it who was thinking about it?
Was it erm what did they call Isobel Isobel.

Was n't it her?
Was n't it just before or after her husband died?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I phoned Shirley and she said she's fine.
I told her off for not le not telling me she was ill.
And she said, no, no!
I'm fine.
She's got her friend Sandy staying with her.
She was, he was in the house, I did n't speak to him though.
so that, I just spoke to Shirley.
Erm Sandy's staying with her for a few days.
What else did she say?
No I did n't mention it.
At the moment.
She's got somebody.
staying now.
I asked her about the letter and she kne she said she could n't remember anything about it but she filled in something when they came back from Belfast.
And she said, open it.
So I opened it and it's one of these things er if you book to go to Dublin before May the, whatever, the end of May.
then if you went again in the autumn you you ge you get er fifty pounds ' worth of vouchers or something, yo you go half price.
It's one of those con things like they tried.
Yes.
Why, I mean why would she go to.
Dublin before.
it's and why Dublin when er, when they were.
when they crossed from Northern.
Ireland?
Yeah.
Anyway, she does n't want it.
Martin still ha has n't got his erm invalidity pension sorted out.
But he's managing alright at the moment.
He's filled in all the things.
I forgot to er, I have n't watched the television at all.
And I forgot to record, what do you call that thing?
With a devil in it?
I fo.
I forgot to.
That's, I know, I forgot to record it for you.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight.
Does that rain mean it's off the coast or it's.
in our area?
And was that minus one just the western side or us as well?
Oh yeah.
Oh well.
According to this it's cloud.
At least it's a white cloud not a black one.
Did you see your mother?
Oh.
Oh.
What was she doing tonight?
Ooh!
Mostly.
sunny spells.
I'll have to get some washing done.
Sally was quite intrigued by that.
You'll have to get this week's a new one.
We'll have to get a a better box.
There's some bottles jars for the bottle bank as well.
You know the last time you missed the erm.
the last time you missed the television pages television supplement and a comic thing out of the Mirror.
I do n't think he believed me.
And it's in it'll be twice in a month.
And Chris is back again as our paper boy.
The other was so useless!
But according to the er, that new manager in the paper shop everyone else got theirs.
So I said, well I'm sorry but I'm not included in everyone else.
And he gave me one.
The Radio Times?
Why?
Oh.
Are we staying up all Thursday night?
What shift are you on on Friday?
Oh!
Of course.
Well you could stay in bed all day on Friday.
And I could take the kids to school and go back I could do that.
We need to oh no we do n't.
I need to go to the Co-op and Iceland.
What shall I get for your mother?
I'll get her some chocolate biscuits or something.
You would think she would put on a lot of weight would n't you?
I know, she's she does n't eat that much, but what she is eating i everything's sweet.
Chocolates and.
Pardon?
Well sh I do n't know.
She goes in the.
Mm?
I know.
Most of them are, well yes.
But, they certainly do.
If anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing, yes I would eat it cos I was always hungry.
Which reminds me I meant to get weighed this morning before I had my breakfast.
And I forgot.
Remind me tomorrow.
Before I eat anything.
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out.
Are those ankle boots dry?
What?
It's better now.
I get, on Wednesday I, I did the erm Angeline said to me do n't do the high impact if you think it's going to hurt again.
I co still have the support under it.
I managed okay.
It did n't hurt.
The pink one's a dish cloth.
The blue one's the one I wipe up small stains off the floor.
I wonder how Bryony is?
I said, I wonder how Bryony is?
And she was n't very well yesterday.
Every time she got a bump or knock off one of the others she was crying instead of clouting them back.
It must have been Richard, I do I do n't think Richard's very, he.
I said I do n't well stop running the tap.
I say, I do n't think Richard's very well either.
Cos he cried more than usual.
I wonder what time, the other night, Trevor had with them on his own?
What do you think of granny Jean offering it offering again to get Martin from school to save Trevor walking him home?
I do n't know.
I like her.
I like her.
Can I just ri rinse my thingy.
And get my in.
Ooh!
I've got hand cream on my hands.
That spurtle was used as a I ca n't.
remember what Richard was using it as yesterday.
What are we going to do about these tiles for the step.
to cover this little hole in our path?
I should hate to think what must be down there now.
Tt.
Oh!
Well leave it cos it's it's.
Cheaper?
Fenwicks?
Cheaper than the do-it-yourself shop up Brady's?
But when, can we get through to Newcastle?
Which Tuesday?
After they break up?
Yes.
The what?
Lin.
See, you did n't tell me about that.
You did n't.
All you told me go on ah only this one's.
all you told me was that Miss was retiring.
But, I have n't to tell anyone.
Which I have n't done.
Which I do n't intend to do.
Yes.
Aha.
Yes.
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Oh you mean a bed?
Well.
D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be.
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
But why's.
Yes.
Aha.
Mhm.
Yeah.
A what?
A.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which.
one?
Was going to see Miss.
Oh.
I see.
I did n't know which one.
Hold on.
Wha how where is it going to be seen from?
A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat.
exhibition?
I ca n't see the education committee with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here.
to go Ashington Hospital to do a.
garden.
No.
I would expect.
that's a very low priority.
Well I do n't.
And then you'll need a P S V.
licence.
I only know one person I only know one bus driver with children.
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.
Er this letter from the Multiple Sclerosis.
that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're not.
you're not reducing the size of the bus.
And someone who's been just used to driving a car are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra.
tuition?
Whether it's got whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine.
it does n't alter the length of the bus.
I know.
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition.
and just drive.
it?
Oh you do, the they've looked into that.
Yeah.
Did n't you da drive Dancy Dags?
Yeah, but yo you drove that one.
Mm.
You drive her to Ashington in it.
Erm do you think I should throw these roses out?
They're.
dead are n't they?
It's a shame.
Pardon?
Oh I know.
I know, but they were dead by about Tuesday.
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
So what a shame.
Never mind.
Right, I'll put my make up on.
Er er.
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one.
Well.
Jus just leave it there for now.
Erm I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops.
I know.
I'm gon na have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner.
I'll take that upstairs with me.
Ooh!
My head feels a lot better.
Oh!
I do n't.
I have n't had a a headache like this for a.
I know.
I need some le er the, I wanted a carton of live yoghurt I do n't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start it was fruit flavoured, no it was n't, it was natural, but it said mild flavoured.
and I do n't think it was the proper like the Greek style, real live yoghurt that would have.
started all the fungus growing on it.
It is beginning to look like a proper stone cup though.
And they're saying that er okay, I'll go and get ready.
I do n't think it matters, but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night.
I've got the.
I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still.
I got it standing on that brick so it would drain.
I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
Some of the erm stems on it look as if the not mouldy but they're, they're sort of.
green.
Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out are n't they?
I would have thought the tulip that went in the er coal scuttle the tulips in the cauldron I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely.
They were.
just grown up again.
And those forget-me-nots that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm tiny pinkey, purpley flowers.
If they're blue, so am I!
The wha.
Is there one in the tub?
No.
Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one.
I like the other best as well, it's the peach one.
When are you going to prune them?
I wonder when er John's going to have the erm.
Yes.
Oh!
Said in yesterday's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
Where the back gardens are n't particularly accessible.
So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds.
Cos it did n't, it did n't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow.
So we'll have to get it.
What four tapes?
That who sent to you?
Ah ah!
I wish you'd think of something you would like for your birthday.
Well I ca n't see very well through binoculars.
Oh Jim they're too heavy.
It does n't need a camera, it needs you!
New.
new camera.
You.
You have never sat down and read.
all the.
read all the instructions, the same with the video camera.
You have n't even watched the tape.
Oh!
You must have been able to squeeze half an hour sometime or other.
Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work.
Will we?
Right, I'm ready.
Have you locked the back door?
I thought we were walking?
I thought we were walking?
Are we not?
Okay.
Pardon?
I thought we were walking?
Well I'll have to go to the paper shop.
Oh.
That's a good idea.
I'll turn it.
I hope we can get out at the road end.
Have you stuck a poster in, no you have n't, in the back window?
I think more people see the back.
coming up that way than they do the front window.
Yeah.
Yes.
Have I got my glasses with me or I ca n't see the prices.
Oh!
I have n't got my purse.
Oh well, brilliant!
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I have n't got a key to get back in the house.
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
If you give me the key please.
Thanks.
Ooh!
It's there.
Sorry!
He did n't look very pleased did he?
We do n't usually get a second post on a Saturday.
Oh yeah.
I've dropped my pen under your seat.
I'll get it when we sa unless you, have you got another one?
Thanks.
Have you seen Kathleen, er Katherine recently?
I've just realized I have n't either, when I saw that woman crossing the road I thought it was her.
Please let us out someone!
Press the.
button somebody.
Oh, thank you kind sir.
It was n't what?
We need some sugar.
We've had no sugar all this week.
Not that you've noticed.
I made the custard from er sugar cubes.
And I did n't know how lo how old the sugar cubes were.
Right.
We got them when we packed up your mother's house.
Right, where am I, I'll meet at er.
Co-op.
Okay.
I ca n't get out any quicker.
See you later.
Hello.
please.
And there was no erm television supplement, and no comic in the Daily Mirror this morning.
That's the second time in the past four weeks we've had missed that.
Seventeen.
Aha.
Sixteen forty eight.
There you go, the sixty five.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have n't given me the bits missing from the Mirror.
Well I'm sorry but my Daily Mirror divi delivered this morning without the television supplement, and without the comic and I want.
them.
The whole, the whole supplement that come on Saturdays.
That part.
This part was not in.
And there's usually a free comic as well and that was n't in either.
And that's the second time in the past four weeks that those pieces have been missing from it.
No, I do n't need the whole paper, I've got the rest of it.
Well you're going to have to!
Because.
when I pay for a paper I want it to be complete, so I want that piece and I want that, that piece.
No, wait a minute, where is it?
Which is the television?
Where does it start?
Which is the beginning of this?
There we are.
Right, so I've got the two pieces that are missing from my paper.
Well I've already paid for mine so I'm going to get.
so, well you'll just have to tell them that it's missing.
But when I've paid for a newspaper I expect all the pieces that I've paid for.
And I've already paid for mine, so this I'll take.
Thank you.
Hello.
I said to him.
Hello.
Hello.
That's.
Oh.
I'll support that.
Aha.
Will it go in?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Because we get no sun in this room whatsoever.
of course.
with the the bathroom.
blocking it off.
You sound like me, I'm always moving.
Would you like some coffee?
Where's she been?
Oh!
I did n't know.
I.
was talking to Maurice yesterday.
Yes.
He's a lovely little boy is n't he?
Urgh!
This coffee's.
cold.
Did you see those on the news yesterday?
Adults and children.
injuries.
I fell off one the week before last at the soft play but it was n't blown up quite enough.
And, as I ste.
Well, there was.
there's a great you know the big heavy erm, foam thing, but it kept slipping away.
All the morning I kept pushing it back again.
Er.
and it a it had happened to of slipped away at that time and I went to step off, and, with it not being blown up properly that's how it just flattened and I went off sid I've still got a big bruise on my left knee!
So I, I do not jump on any more.
So they've got, they've got it back now, so it's got nothing to do with us?
Do you work?
Mm.
Was that the year the oranges were horrible?
I've.
they were Seville oranges, I'm sure they were.
Seville oranges.
Well that year.
Well if you're at work.
If you're at work Dorothy could go If I help, I'll help with Trevor with his triplets.
Yes, but it's, he, he could n't possibly push that buggy.
around that field.
Oh!
That's.
better.
Oh!
Because of that lea.
leaking.
Yes.
Right.
Fred.
Well I helped you one year.
cos there was only.
there was only you and somebody else.
There was one child came up about seventeen times.
I think.
Yeah.
I ca n't say that properly.
Those words are n't used where I come from.
Mind, I use words that Jim does n't.
Yes.
I know all the children.
And ee, all the kids ended up with a prize did n't they?
Yeah they.
The winners got.
Yes.
They had big eggs, well, you know, sort of the.
Smarties type egg so about so big.
for the prizes.
and the others got little Cadbury's.
Creme Eggs.
Which remi reminds me, I've got to get some for all they spare children before.
before they ran out.
The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round and then they run out at Easter.
That's happened, I could n't get any one year I took the triplets to the erm Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola and one of them won a Creme Egg.
but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag and er it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some I, I ca n't remember what we were doing afterwards so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it.
Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between those three and their older brother.
No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er.
James had had it.
Mm.
Mm.
I've been counting them since.
I read the letter in the paper.
There were thirteen.
drakes cha er chasing one duck er, just past the baths along the promenade.
And then we sat at the far side of the Old Gate bridge and er an old lady came along and said, and she was counting them but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven although, in actual fact, by then th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down.
And a there was a domestic one in each group there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one near Old Gate Bridge.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I came along the river path when I came home from shopping.
Sitting in the, the sand, damp sand under the bridge.
Yes.
No.
Mhm.
Well.
There were wild rumours flying around on Wednesday, I was told.
by several people that the Skillery had gone.
In.
Well Jim, Jim saw the children going back to er school after swimming.
over it on Thursday afternoon but er.
Yeah.
Was Fold Cottage flooded?
It did n't.
I thought they built a wall around it the.
last people who bought it.
Yeah.
Aha.
It's called Aubern House is it?
Oh!
Yes.
And I, I gave up smoking when I was pregnant.
It was it was the.
The cooker was three pounds a quarter.
And he let.
We could n't afford to drink!
We were destitute in those days.
We did n't know at the time, but I was n't working.
and we were actually living, living below the poverty line.
If I'd read erm i if I'd read properly all the instructions in the back of the er book.
I would have got fo erm free orange juice, free vitamin drops.
and free milk for Gareth.
But, Jim was a charge nurse.
Goodness only knows what staff nurses did then?
Jim was a charge nurse, it never occurred to us that we were living before, below the poverty line.
I mean, er.

Possibly.
we do we do live on.
we do n't live on so much erm.
broth and er.
we used to have, I used to make big pan of broth you could get gorgeous bacon bones with plenty bacon on in the Co-op in those days, it were wi it was when they, they did all the boning in the shops and you could go, get good meaty bones and I used to.
I used to fill it full of vegetables.
and barley so, and.
and split peas.
But er it was po possibly a healthier diet actually, than we have now.
It was quite fat free anyway.
When you, when you look and you see how people survived and of course they delivered the that you, I mean like we had dripping and bread.
Yes.
You read books like erm Lark Rise to.
Candleford and there they went breakfast was bread and dripping and.
I gave my, a.
a few years ago when my sons were teenagers I had some nice dripping and I said, you've never had bread and dripping and I gave them some, I put a bit of salt on, I said, try this, I loved a bit of med bread and dripping when I was your age.
And they took a mouthful and urgh!
Urgh!
And we when how old were they when we went to Whitley for a holiday?
And I saw some liquorice root and I said, oh!
Look Jim.
I have n't seen that for years.
I used to buy that for a ha'penny.
a ha'penny for two sticks.
And I got them some of that, urgh urgh!
They thought it was horrible.
So there was I walking round Whitley chewing this liquorice root.
I did n't like the locust beans though.
And I loved a pennorth of, a pennorth of karie lick your finger and dip that in.
I know they call it sherbet now, but it's not the same, it was sort of erm.
it's like sugary.
Was it two ounces a week we got?
I used to get my, my teacakes.
No.
I.
I knew what a pineapple.
looked like because we had erm.
a black leaded, no we had one of these black leaded grates, you know, with.
oven at the side.
and there was a pineapple on the oven door.
The first.
oh we, I, I got dried bana we had dried bananas Jim.
I was under five.
And my bro.
My brother and I got dried bananas.
and we also got peanut butter because we were under five.
But erm.
the first bananas I saw, my.
My great aunt had a sho.
a fruit shop.
Erm just very occasionally in the school holidays.
erm at lunchtime I do n't have many children at school holidays because apart from one of them, all of them have one or both parents who are teachers.
so I have Sally, and, and er, her mum always cooks a meal in the evening so I, I do something like toasted cheese sandwiches or beans on toast or something like that at lunch time, but there was one time when she wanted peanut butter and, all her brother used to ask, I, her brother does n't come to me now, he stays at home cos he's going on fifteen, and as he's next door but one anyway, you know if, if anything goes wrong he can come along to me, but all he wanted was my homemade blackcurrant jam, and now he does n't come any more I've got to actually give him.
I give him the blackcurrant jam, I give Myrene the blackcurrant jam, jam to take home for him.
He loves it!
Oh I like, I qui I quite like making jam.
And it would be absolutely sacrilegious to, to buy hot cross buns.
Yeah.
Oh do no I.
Oh.
No there are certain things that I just could n't do.
I could n't buy a Christmas pudding, and I could n't buy a hot cross bun.
It, I think it's too ingrained in me from my grandmother and my mother.
You know, you made your Christmas puddings, everybody had to have a wish when they stirred them.
I better see if this dinner's ready.
Bye.
Hey, you know, talking about the ducks on the river, you know that elderly, ever so refined lady.
Yes.
I think she must have been quite well off some time, had fallen on really hard times.
I mean, she told me oh, a couple of years ago that she was eighty.
And, I better get this dinner out.
And erm she always thought of her husband as daddy.
And her daughter I think she must have been getting on because around the time she told me that she was eighty, she happened to mention that her daughter was forty.
I know, her daughter, er her daughter's not married.
Well I have n't seen her feeding the ducks for about three or four months.
I wonder if she's died or she's ill?
I know.
All, all her clothes came from jumble sales.
Everything.
She wa she was buying, long after nylon shirts went out of fashion, there we there was a pile of nylon shirts, and she said I'm, I'm just looking to see if this if these will be suitable for daddy.
I ca n't remember er, she gave me the reason why she wanted these for oh, he, he, he always wears his cuffs out or something.
She was quite pleasant to talk to, I liked listening to her.
I do n't think I know her name.
So, I could n't even ask anyone.
Are you ready for your dinner?
I've made the tea.
I forgot to put those in the freezer.
I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon.
Which?
Where?
In the front room?
How many have grown?
Sometimes you look at them.
It does n't matter, you do n't need to look.
Get on with your dinner!
You'll be late.
So that's seven out of ten, was it?
Well that's not bad for one ninety nine.
There's erm I know they'd be, probably be better quality but there are nine, I think it is, advertised in today's paper that say, erm for er eleven ninety nine.
So even, we get seven for one ninety nine, it's a bargain.
I hope they're different colours.
Well they go on flowering for quite, you you've got.
Oh yeah, you'll have to le leave the children's.
Aha.
I do n't think, I dunno that I wonder if we should put some gravel under that umb umbrella tree.
Or if it should even be near that radiator.
In Australia, you know they grow into great big huge trees in Australia, Mrs told me.
She said er, Derek has them in his garden.
Well it must get hotter than it does in this house for a start!
I was freezing last night in bed!
And you were snoring.
I hardly got any sleep last night, my head was aching so much.
How can I, it, I was on my side.
Ouch!
Ooh they're hot!
How many staff have you got off?
Mm.
Will you be home late?
Mm.
Have you checked the television pages?
Is there any wildlife programmes or anything you want me to oh hold on, I've got it here.
Er.
The Messiah?
The Messiah, the Messiah in Dublin seven forty five tomorrow.
Right.
There's absolutely nothing on on Saturdays.
I hate being here with on my own on a Saturday.

Might as well watch the wildlife programme.
Oh well.
Tt.
Jim'll Fix it, the Big Break.
Oh.
Clint Eastwood film.
On The Up.
On The Up's a repeat.
Casualty's a repeat.
The Life and Works.
A writer has his work, has her works republished and proves to be something of a mixed blessing.
I wonder what that's about?
It do n't give you much information.
Film, The Marrying Kind at three twenty five.
Barton and Simpson comedy An Extra Bunch of Daffodils.
A humorous view of a wife murderer from the writers who brought us Hancock and Steptoe.
Stratford John's Killer.
That might be interesting.
That's at five past eight.
Randall and Hopkirk Deceased.
That surely must be a repeat.
They have n't put repeat on for that.
Johnny Cash and San Quentin.
I seem to remember seeing that years ago.
Is that the, ah!
T V Heaven.
Ah!
So it is.
I do n't remember An Extra Bunch of Daffodils do you?
Oh oh oh!
Live and Let Die.
House of Fear.
A spooky tale about a woman who returns to the stately which has been home to the Stafford Dynasty for hundreds of years.
The trouble is her ancestors are still around.
It does n't say who, I suppose, the guests are.
Nope.
Absolutely nothing.
Are these oh.
Mm.
There's much more on a Sunday.
There's May to De December.
And I like Lovejoy, except I've missed but they're repeats, but I never saw it the first time.
Did we?
Messiah in Dublin.
Well there's no point in me watching it if I'm going to record it for you.
I'll watch it with you.
Blimey!
He's brave.
A man left paralysed from the waist down after a parachuting acce accident two years ago, attempts the World's first solo paraplegic sky dive.
Blimey!
Perhaps he thinks lightning does n't strike twice.
Jeeves and Wooster.
Screaming Thing.
Knocked quite a lot in their reviews in the papers.
I like it.
And I like Wed anyway.
What are your shifts next week?
Can you remember offhand?
Wait a minute.
You're early, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?
And you're off Thursday, Friday.
Oh.
It's time you had some early.
Do what?
Why?
Has someone changed with you?
That will be Easter Sunday.
Do we want to travel on Easter Sunday?
Well if it had n't been al for all those hours and hours hold ups last time we went down I quite like travelling overnight.
Especially when you get to the M twenty five.
Are you ready for your pudding?
If it stays fine I think I'll put another load of washing in here.
I think I've given myself too much dinner.
And I've got, there was some left if you wanted it by the way?
If forgot.
I cooked too much.
D'ya know that blue wool I got?
Well Dorothy got er, some to knit something for Bryony and she actually got too much so if I do run out if I have n't enough to finish this er er vest, T-shirt summer top, whatever it's called she'll have some.
Mm mm.
There should be plenty of that wool for me.
I still have to stitch er, erm my cardigan up for Melanie but erm it was easy to start off the other one while I was talking to your mother.
Right.
.So were these dumplings okay?
Well they were ma and they were made with vegetarian suet.
Catherine's were baked not boiled.
I prefer baked dumplings anyway.
I've, I would bake dumplings if you liked them.
I prefer them baked.
I like crusty tops on them.
You only had a tiny taste of one.
You were pinching somebody else's I do n't know.
I do n't know.
They were in the middle of the dinner when we got there.
You'd had yours.
And you grabbed a piece of somebody's dumpling and said, oh I'll have a bite of that.
And you said afterwards you did n't like it.
Well they must be better for you than an animal fat.
They cook just as fluffy.
as with ordinary suet.
What?
You can have a, a cholesterol test, you know in erm.
which chemist is it?
Er Simm and Webb, they've got a notice on the window, have your cholesterol tested.
Why do n't you go and see?
Well I would be interested to see them put.
I know what mine is, mine was erm well below.
the last ti what did I have to go for?
The last time I went for a smear and a blood pressure check and various things sh I, I said are you doing cholesterol checks?
And she said no.
Would you like one?
And I said, yes I would please.
Anyway, I had to ring up after two week, ca n't you remember?
I rang up after two weeks and I spoke to the nurse and she said, oh, your cholesterol's alright.
And I said but what is it please?
And she said, oh well it's no it was the receptionist, she said it's fine.
And I said, yes but I would like to know exactly what my cholesterol count is.
So she said, oh I'll have to get the nurse.
So the nurse came on the phone and she sa she said erm oh it's, it's fine it's well within the limits.
And I said, but what is it?
So she said it was five point four, or five point six I think it was.
Why ca n't they just tell you?
Why do you have to drag these things out of people.
I want to know.
Oh!
That's stupid.
It's my body!
Betty's Betty has lived on they had roast beef for Christmas because they'd eaten no red meat for so long.
with her cholesterol, that they actually, she was so sick of turkey and chicken, and fish and er she's had no cream cakes.

She uses semi-skimmed milk.
He's thoroughly settled is n't he?
Thank you.

The horse race?

Oh!

I'm thinking about Tony.
Oh well.
And is Alex comi are you expecting Alex?
Anyway, talking of over the road, where is she?
Is she home?
Still?
And has she been cleared o.
Has she?
She's not.
demanding to be home or anything?
Yeah.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Would she agree to it?
Oh!
But.
Oh!
Well how old is she, eighty.
eighty two.
Yeah.
Yes.
In fact, one of the nurses had said to Jim last night your mum said er do n't tell my brother and then, then she said, your brother?
Who, who is your brother?
She said, I do n't, I mean, do n't tell my son.
So well Jim said, well what is it?
She said I ca n't tell you, I have n't to tell you!
So he did n't know what she'd been up to.
Oh yeah.
Aha.
Mm.
I've never been in wo in er one or two.
Two.
I've never been in ward two.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
Oh!
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Who's Mr got in with him?
Has he got.

Yeah.
Oh!
Mhm.
Get out.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh.
So are they selling his house?
Is n't it?
Oh!
Who does it belong to?
Mm!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, that's right.
He did.
Yeah.
Oh well.
Is Doug going into the police or applying?
I know.
He told me he applied but I thought he told me he'd been turned down.
Yeah.
Cos er erm.
Marie Marie was going down to her mother's she was running as usual, she dashed up to our back door and said, is Doug around?
And I said, I do n't know what shift he's on, is his car out?
And it was n't.
And I said do you want a piece of paper to write him a message or something?
And she said, no it was just that he's talking of renting his house erm and I know of someone who wants to rent one.
So I said well where's Doug going?
Then she said something about June and the Met.
Or did she say he's going for an interview in June for the Met, or something, anyway.
Cos I, I have n't seen him at all.
Mm.
In fact, I thought it must be all finished with because he, he was quite talkative about it during the summer.
then I, and he said to me about.
being turned down.
Oh!
Yes.
I tell you someone erm our boiler went wrong on ah, I think it was Wednesday.
Thursday, I just ca n't remember, and Raymond came through.
it must have been Thursday because I did n't want him to come, I said to Jim, tell him not to come we'll just turn the whole lot off.
But the kitchen was reeking of.
fumes!
And, and.
er, I could feel it prickling the back of my nose and my throat.
and and my eyes started to water.
I opened the windows.
Oh!
And there was when it came on, in the afternoon there was this tremendous very loud roar!
Now, it sometimes goes whoosh!
It comes on initially.
and it immediately dies down and then it's okay, but there was this tremendous roar and a loud click and it went out.
And it was only about we i it was wi within a couple of minutes, or, probably less Jim came in er I think he was, I do n't know where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I think.
Yes he was.
And I told him about it, and he said oh yes, the pilot light has gone out and he relit it.
And it was fine.
It sounded okay but we kept getting these fumes.
So we kept opening the door it blew out once again and he put it on again and we were still getting these fumes till about oh about half past five it seemed to stop, u we had the windows open.
And then Raymond phoned at about quarter to seven.
No.
He did n't.
Sorry!
Sorry!
It we he phoned at it was, it was five to six, Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of the weather.
I had my wellies in case the leisure centre was flooded!
Ha.
There was only ten of us there.
Anyway, erm Raymond was on the phone because he was tal and I was saying to Jim tell him I do n't want him to come if the ra if the road's cut off to Blythe I do n't want him to get stuck, I mean, he's got a wife.
and two small children at home.
And I'm saying, it's time I was out, I'm gon na be late.
Anyway, he insisted he was coming at half past seven.
And he came at half past seven and he cleaned it and he looked at it, and he said er it was n't anything that he could see, he thinks it was just down draught, but we've had winds before.
And he said that the cowl we've got on that chimney.
off the kitchen and ru and runs the boiler, he said it's the best kind you can get, nothing should come in there.
And as he's driven up at the back then he looked up and he said you ca you could see daylight through it so it was, was n't blocked by anything.
Erm but he said.
I do n't know.
I said could it have been continuous rain?
And he said something about he'd once they'd once had to work all one day and all one night a near the Regent Centre because er, something had gone wrong with the gas pipes because erm of flooding.
So whether we've but nobody else seems to have noticed anything like this.
Anyway, he could n't find anything.
He said, we'll just have to leave it and, if it happens again we'll have to go into it further, but it has n't happened again, so now it's okay.
Except last night I thought what on earth's this?
It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking, and I was n't cooking anything at all.
I mean Jim went to work at one o'clock and the last of the kids went home, I've had my dinner.
at midday.
But i it was no, it was no stronger in the kitchen than the living room.
I sniffed around the boiler, I sniffed around the cooker.
ah, but when the kids went home I just had ha I had a sandwich.
That's all I had, I had n't cooked anything.
Erm the triplets had soup and stottie and I warmed that up in the microwave.
And this smell lasted for about half an hour and then, then I could n't smell it again.
Er ooh!
I ca n't remember the make.
It's one of these that uses less fuel.
More efficient.
Well we've had it, how long have we had it?
About three, four years.
Anyway, how are the.
We've have had, we.
Yes.
Th the shelf with containers on have been too close, you know those Tupperware containers?
Have been too close to it and it had, and the vents at the back had got churned up with dust at one time, I keep dusting it now.
Anyway, while I go Ra Raymond was here, he says, oh Alan's back.
And they said, well where from?
He said well he's got a transfer to Accrington.
Did n't you know he was in the prison service?
I did n't.
Yes.
And he had to go and train somewhere down south, but he's got a he, apparently he'd been trying for a year and he's got to Accrington.
Cos I thought he was doing pretty well in the Post Office, he was.
he was getting promotion.
Oh!
Is there?
Yeah.
It's, no, it, that's the Telecom I think, he actually worked for the.
Post Office.
He started off as a counter clerk.
and worked his way higher up.
No.
I mean, last year was Oh!
Oh!
I saw Gillian I met her round.
Do n't you know your own number?

It is Gillian.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw her briefly, and, I did n't even speak to her other than to say hello.
Dorothy and I took the triplets for their nursery visit on.
Thursday.
Er they would n't go and sit down for the story with all the other children sit at, sat on my knee on the floor for a short while.
Cos, at home you see er Dorothy and Trevor always read their stories in bed, and when I read their stories I have me on the arm chair two sitting on one chair arm.
and one sitting on the other chair arm.
so that they can all see the pictures.
So, they could n't get it into their heads that you had to sit on the floor.
Mind, when I read their story on erm I read them on Thursday afternoon and I said, right we better practise for nursery.
so I had the older ones from Goose Hill.
you know the when they were off school.
and I sat them on the floor.
and they sat and listened then.
They're three on the nineteenth.
And, the other thing it took a while for u for us to get them to, they'd never drunk milk out of a straw, through a straw.
and a third of a pint bottle is too big.
I only give them half that much at a time.
Bryony especially tends to drink small amounts.
But you leave the cup on the table and she'll call you back every ten.
minutes for a sip.
But of course, they were picking the bottle up and they were trying to tip it as well.
So I'll have to get some straws and we'll have to practise.
that.
No, this, they're quite, they did n't th they were quite tough.
strong plastic ones so they they did n't chew.
they did n't chew them.
And er.
I know.
Yes.
Yes, well when we came out Bryony was difficult to start with, she did n't want her coat on.
But Richard I was trying to get his on a and I, I've, I've helped two other children to put theirs on, I do n't know who they were, and Dorothy says, oh we better get out Ann the teacher wanted the the visitors.
to get out before.
the others came.
Well, we just got out into the hallway where all these mothers were standing round and.
Richard threw himself on the floor screaming!
He was n't going home.
And I was try and he, he of course he's, he's heavy.
and when he just makes himself flop, he would n't stand up.
When I tried to sit him up.
to put his coat on, I picked him up and tried to carry him, and he just flung himself around so hard I had to put him down and he immediately flung himself on the floor again!
Oh!
Golly!
Anyway.
Yes.
Oh!
He was staying there.
And we I was I was trying to explain to him that erm we've had to go home, the teachers were clearing everything up.
all the children were going home.
because there were different children coming in the afternoon.
But no, no.
So I picked him up and I carried him, Dorothy had gone out the wrong door, instead of going out the door at that end she'd gone right along this long corridor.
so I followed her and of course, we're going past all the blooming classrooms!
And the.
classrooms all had their doors open.
And anyway I carried him half way along and I had to put him down.
I managed to get his coat on and a woman came along, I, I do n't know if she was a dinner lady or what, she had a a sort of overall on and er I said come on let's catch up with your mummy, and she said, ah!
Are these triplets?
Are these.
Mr's triplets?
And I said yes.
And she said, oh Mr teaches my son at school.
She said, come along hold my hand as well and er, I'll tell my son tha that, that er Mr's son took me to the door.
So he shut up.
and listened to her.
He'd calmed down tha.
by then.

Mhm.
Mhm.
Yes.
The one we should have go gone in.
and come out of?
Yes.
Mhm.
Mhm.

It's a lovely nursery is n't it?
They've got every kind of toy and equipment you can think of.
And they've got it divided up into bits with a, sort of a little kitchen.
Erm and then there's one like a little living room, it has a little settee in it and chairs, you know, child size?
And there's a big er water play bath sort of thing.
and sand and slides and.
Yes.
And every kind of building brick and Duplo brick and Lego brick and Stickle brick and.
things.
And plenty of easels and paint.
and er oh, they've also got books yo you know you can buy the books.
just just in that er, sort of little tiny lobby bit.
where you turn right to go into the nursery.
into the actual classroom.
er, they've got books on there.
and there's a, a book to sign and you can borrow any book.
then you just sign the book to say you've got it.
And have you looked erm, the headmistress took us outside to see the yard and that looks.
huge.
yard with a a apparently they have er, a lot of in the summer they do a lot of er whatever they're doing out there.
Practically everything they do out there, they take all the equipment outside.
Oh!
Mm.
Still around?
Yeah.
Does she?
Mm!
Is that, you put it flat onto it.
it's a windproof thing.
Oh yes.
she's gon na be one of the very young ones.
Yeah.
Ya.
Mm.
Do you remember when I had erm Michael he's fifteen now.
The one whose mum had multiple sclerosis they lived at Upham Pond.
He was only four and one week when he started school.
His birth er his birthday was the thirty first of August and I think it was, I ca n't remember when he started.
it was the fifth or the sixth of.
I think it was the sixth of September.
And he was I know he was chubby but he was quite short.
He looked so young.
Oh yes.
That's where er.
Dorothy takes the triplets on Mondays.
They, they are actually starting nursery school on the fifth of May.
They seem so tiny to be going five mornings a week though.
Mhm.
Yes.
I do n't.
Yes.
Er well, well she'll obviously.
collect them on Mondays and Fridays.
and walk up, they'll get the minibus down.
I forgot to notice exactly where the mi where the bus stop outside the school.
Oh!
Yes.
Well I'll have to move myself away from the school gate they can just they think I'll be actually waiting.
at the school gate.
Oh.
Oh that's fine.
And the yeah.
Mm.
Their grandma said to me yesterday, have you worked out how you're going to get to nursery?
And I said, well yes I'll just walk up and I'll get the minibus back.
And she said, will you manage?
But, I've had them on buses several times just when I, when I'm going on a bus.
It wo n't be a special treat any more once they're coming back from nursery three times a week on a bus will it?
And probably when I was.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yes.
Aha.
Aha.
Yeah.
Have I seen you since erm I have n't seen you to talk to for very long have I?
Well it's.
d'ya know it's funny, on a Wednesday when I go, when they've gone home and I've tidied up a bit.
and gone straight to aerobics for six o'clock.
I feel quite fit by the time I get back, you know by the time I've done.
the aerobics you sho I should be feeling absolutely knackered!
But I'm not.
I fe I fe I feel, you know.
I feel full of beans and quite.
hungry by then.
Yes.
Mm.
It's like Jim at work he's shattered when he comes in.

Mm.

I never feel cold in your house.
Aha.
Yes.
You might have slightly overcooked it.
It's, you tend, to start with you do tend to erm.
overcook things.
I know i i it.
Did you let it stand?
For a while after?
Before it carries on.
It's like when you cook.
cakes they look as if they're not quite cooked.
but by the time they've stood for five minutes they are.
Did you remember if you cook a cake and you put a piece of erm kitchen paper over the top.
Oh.
I, I ca n't remember where I got, I remember telling Beryl that a long.
time ago.
well before she knows.
Someone who told me roundabout that.
time.
The other thing is yes.
Yes.
What.
kind of a cake did you make?
Oh.
Chocolate cakes are, are very nice if.
you do, brown, but use brown sugar.
And u and dark brown.
sugar.
I that's nice and.
moist.
But when you, when you time when the cooked cake's finished cooking.
if you leave it for two minutes.
run a knife round.
tip it up onto your hand, just briefly.
just for a second, and then.
back a again.
Let's the air go, and get underneath.
and that helps the bottom to dry out quicker.
Now someone else told me, and it worked, and if you just lay a piece of kitchen paper over the top, that absorbs some of the moisture.
as well and ta and the top is n't so soggy.
But chocolate cakes are definitely the best.
In the microwave.
Yes.
Yeah but they're so.
they're so pale as well.
The o.
the only cakes I make in erm in a microwave are chocolate cakes.
Yes.
They're a lot moister if you, if you use dark brown sugar.
they definitely are a lot more moist.
And as long as you do n't over, overcook them.
And I'll tell you what I always do.
I've got these, you know the very thin microwave dishes?
They're getting a bit battered now.
They're very thin plastic.
They're about.
Th I got them in the electricity board, there three for sixty pence.
You're only, I think you're only supposed to use them for a, a few months, I've been using them for about three years.
Er, they've got a dimple in here and there.
But er.

Yeah.
Mhm.
That might help.
Yeah.
Yes.
Ah!
Ah!
These things are about so high.
Smales.
have a lot of microwave dishes.
They're about that wide and they're about that deep and I just put a circle of greaseproof in the bottom.
do n't grease them or anything.
Ju I just lay a piece of greaseproof in the bottom.
I do n't grease them I just put this I've got a pile of little circles of greaseproof paper ready cut to to fit the.
bottom of the.
three dishes.
I've done it for all kinds of things, I mean, I, I cook vegetables in them in it and I warm up.
tins of peas in it.
I warm up baked beans for the children's.
tea in it.
In fact, they're.
stained with tomato soup.
I do n't know why I get tomato soup with all that colour in it.
Yes.
And.
I make mine, I make my, my custard in erm er I think it is it's a casserole about so wide, it's my biggest casserole.
It's a round one about that far across.
Er er nearly two pint I think.
it'll be.
It's about this shallow.
I found it, it, it, it seems to cook quicker.
Erm the last time.
I made half a pint of white sauce in the measuring jug I.
boiled it all over the place.
The last time I made about half a pint of bread sauce, I lost half the bread sauce all over it!
Yeah, you need to stir it every minute or so.
And you do n't.
no you know your erm smoky glass beakers.
do n't use those in.
Nancy used one of those in it and she just lifted it out and the whole lot shattered all over.
the place.
But I read you know when you make your coffee in it.
Give it a stir first.
It's just recently I read about this it's not getting air into it or something is the reason it ex it can suddenly shoot up all over you.
Well I always.
I put the coffee, my milk powder, and the water in.
and, stir it anyway.
and then put it in, and it's so far it's been okay.
Yes.
I di er, I only have er I only make chocolate.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
I have n't got one of.
those of course.
When this wears out I'm gon na.
get rid of this one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Well you know when we got our Vax vacuum cleaner.
that was ten pounds cheaper than Argos.
So, er we got that at the Co-op.
It was.
a hundred and forty nine.
in or a hundred and forty nine ninety nine or whatever it was, I ca n't remember in erm Argos.
and it was ten pounds cheaper in the Co-op.
But so we got it there.
There was something else, you know when I got the when I got my food processor.
that was something like eighty pounds, I ca n't remember exactly.
but for some reason we'd been to Gateshead, and I'd looked up food processors in the Argos catalogue.
and the Index, Littlewoods.
catalogue and we were in Argos, I mean, sorry, we're in Gateshead and we I know I was trying to get erm a very pale peach wallpaper for, for the.
bathroom to match the very, very, very extremely pale peach.
flowers that we've got.
on so many tiles.
and I could n't get any.
And, we've looked in Mawpers, and we've Newcastle, and Jim said let's go to Gateshead.
I ca n't somebody had a sale on in Gateshead so we went there and then we went to the Co-op, and of course, I got the exact paper I wanted, just sort of this mottley mottley, marbly pale peach.
paper.
And we looked at erm food processors.
and we got the food, food processor, it was cheaper than Argos and Index.
I got a free, there was a free electric carving knife with it.
plus, at the time there was five percent extra off erm, cos Jim's got a, a Co-op gold card.
and if you got it through this gold card there was another five percent off so or something like that off.
So, we got a real bargain there.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm very careful with my money.
I always.
check if them things are cheaper first.
Yes.
Mhm.
That, that erm yellow ex Telecom van.
that usually parked down.
the end of the road.
is that the same one that's just gone past with it said erm snacks?
I could just er say read it when it went by.
in big red writing it said snacks, and one er, I could n't make out what.
I do n't know.
Has somebody started up in business?
Oh!
Do n't mention the!
I'd love to slaughter that child!
Having trouble?
Did you not hear about when they broke the thing?
He.
Yeah.
Yes.
Aha.
Mhm.
One of ours was off as well.

Mhm.
Mm.
Well, Jim had just put something through Bob's letter box.
and he heard there was a crash and Martin said, ee!
I've broken the glass.
And the other two, Ali and tha you know the erm, Bangladeshi boy down he plays with them.
There was Ali and the and Michael.
And Jim came along and he says what did you say?
He says I've broken the glass.
And he said well just get yourself home and tell your father that I want it paid for this time because I only replaced that glass last week, which he had.
he'd put it in at the beginning of the week before.
So he came in and he, he, he said I'm just going down to see's father, he's just smashed the glass in the cold frame and I'm I'm sick of this!
Cos he's already stopped him setting fire to trees in the orchard over there.
He's stopped him cutting down trees.
So he went down and it was Kelly he spoke to and er she said he.
Were n't you expecting this?
Oh!
You, when you rang the other night you, you did sound like Jackie, I'm sure you were Jackie on the phone, and with her not living here very long.
thought.
I thought she'd just er you know, she was worried about her children cos as usual they'd left the keys behind, they were the house.
Yeah.
Oh well, if you do n't know.
Forty four days?
Oh.
Oh well.
Are you going to get.
to pay your debts with a pan.
in your hand!
Oh!
Mhm.
Right.
Oh.
Well then, while.
you can you've got ta.
sell out.
Yeah.
We want some erm er, what they call them?
Quarry tiles.
you know to step down into the kitchen.
I would like some quarry tiles on there, but we ca n't get any of the narrow ones, they've got a curved edge.
Well they told, they, they told us that we could n't get i they could n't get us any.
with a curved edge.
And I do n't want the little ones tripping up and crashing their heads on a.
And, and in the corner where the door is there's a hole in the step underneath the the door hinge.
And er James, triplet he's pres er pushing bits of paper and I should imagine there's pens and crayons and all kinds down there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Aha.
You can get them in the square ones, the six by six, but I wa I wanted the way we worked it out, eight by four would work out more economical.
Cos eventually, I would n't mind the kitchen having quarry qua quarry tiles.
I like quarry tiles.
Right.
I do n't know, it's been, I went along to ask Betty and Paul if they knew.
It's been there since before half past one I think.
I was putting the washing on at the back and I saw the en the bit sticking past the house.
I think it must be a, I think it must.
be a driver.
He ca n't, he ca n't be actually at a wedding because.

Oh yes!
We can dream!
Hello.
Oh!
Oh!
Mm.
I know what it was erm the Empire Stores ' man brought a parcel for Jackie when she was out and when.
I took it along to her, to save me locking myself out I put the sneck up.
I must have forgotten to put it down when I came in again.
That was hours ago.
Well I'd hardly be out if the door was n't locked when it's dark.
Ooh!
Was the inside door closed?
Mm.
We have n't got any.
of next door's cats upstairs then?
Have you had a good day?
Why?
Did you have any deaths?
Oh.
Mm.
Had enough for this week.
Right.
I'll get you something to eat.
Are you hungry?
Well it's now, I'll just warm it up.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes, but she's got all the erm she's got hundreds of well not hundreds, but she's got a lot of customers, I mean, she works in huge offices does n't she?
Yeah.
Right.
There was erm what I thought was a, a white Rolls parked outside our house when I was putting the washing on the line just after you went to work.
Erm well I've got ta wash the dishes.
I was with, and it was, I could see it at the front.
Er, it turned out it was n't a Rolls it was a Bentley, but I do n't know one car from.
another.
A.
Yes.
Well it looked like a wedding car cos there were bouquets in the back.
And, Paul was working on his car out the front and I went to ask him if he knew who was getting married.
And er he said it had been standing there for quite a while.
He thought it was maybe just er the driver had taken someone to the church was waiting to go back for them.
And er Betty called me in for a cup of coffee but and I was there, I think, for over two hours.
I did n't mean to stay that long cos I had a lot to do.
Anyway, it was, it was still there.
it was still there when I took.
Housework!
It was still there when I took Jackie's parcel to her and it wa I, I think I did n't look out the, the window till about five o'clock and it had gone then.
But Betty.
Yes.
And tho erm Betty thinks the er the for do er cars as well.
Yes.
See if it is hot enough.
Has that just come through the letter box?
Oh.
I'll make you some.
coffee.
Right.
Is it raining?
Well the back wall looks wet.
It is raining.
I got the washing nearly all dry anyway.
All the shirts.
I did n't it was so bright and windy so I put another lot in after that lot came out it'll be, only be T-shirts I'll have in the dryer when they finish off.
Yeah.
The what?
Which one?
The one facing onto the bridge?
Well I saw the curtains were down erm when I took the triplets.
all around there yesterday, the curtains were down and it looked as if there was a table piled up with cardboard boxes in the, in the front window.
The one on?
Th the one just past the social club?
Well, that one on the cor the first one.
That was the one that was on television with the water right the way.
up it.
Brian?
Have they?
I never noticed that.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Have they done.
that themselves?
And he, he is the very end one is n't he?
Did n't he buy the one that we looked at, once?
I've never seen Ro Rosie for years!
I know, she's working erm.
at the workers ' education what is it called?
W E A?
She works, she works for that.
Erm.
Yes.
I think, yes.
I ca n't remember, but there was a whole.
No it's at Ashington.
No, erm I'm sure it's in a, at Ashington.
And.

I'm not sure.
I think.
I think I think I heard Jean say something about erm the writers ' workshops.
I'm not sure if she said tha that Rosie had, had given them a lecture or something once, then I said oh!
I know Rosie quite well.
There's your coffee.
Was it hot?
Was it.
hot enough for you?
It looked as if it was.
Pardon?
Oh I know, you're like my mother, stone cold!

I know.
I know, I think it's hilarious!
Asdir erm saying my ginger wine was too hot.
Bloody ridiculous!
But they do n't drink red hot stuff I suppose.
I suppose that was the difference.
They do n't drink red hot stuff, they drink, only eat red hot stuff, and they drink cool things to cool their mouth down after!
She drinks tea.
Well she she used to drink tea when she if I ever well I did n't invite her in for a coffee do, well I did n't to begin with did I?
I mean.
No.
I invite, when we walk back from school erm when she first came to live round there, and er I used to walk back from school with her sometimes and say, would you like a cup of coffee?
Well she did n't know anybody of course and she'd say, no thank you.
And then after oh, after a few weeks she said I'll come in for a cup of tea.
So I said, okay.
So I used to make tea for her.
And it got, in the end, actually, if I was, if I had to do something that was urgent or I had to go somewhere I used to have to say to her something like, you know, erm oh I better get on, I got a lot to do this morning, or I'm goi I've to be shopping and be back in time to cook Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting, oh I've got ta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and if I really was pushed otherwise she would have come in every day.
Not that I minded her coming in every day, just did n't, not always that time.
And also, if she came in when I had the triplets it meant that erm you know, she was sitting talking to me when I wanted to be playing with them and taking them out and getting on with doing things with them.
No.
Well I was just talking about that today to Betty.
You ar di did n't you see it?
Did n't you show someone round it once?
Did you notice the bathroom ceiling?
I only saw it erm you showed two lots round did n't you?
I only showed er, Gillian.
Well actually the time I went in it was erm when Gillian was thinking of buying it.
and er I went her mother and father were with her and I just really went in up and down the stairs, and they went upstairs and they, they shouted, oh Ann!
Come and look at this.
And er in the back I think it was the back bedroom there was a, a light switch and the wiring was sort of hanging from, from the switch.
It looked dangerous!
And there was there was something weird.
It was n't a telephone point I do n't know what it was.
No, it came from half way along the hall, up under the stair carpet and into the erm front bedroom, but it, it did n't have a, a sort of, you know the.
it did n't have a telephone, sort of attachment.
And the bathroom ceiling was black mould!
And of course, if it, if it had been I know they came once because.
Well, Syrej.
dropped Asdir off and she drove away and I saw her and the four children go, along to the house.
cos I was in here and er I think she had some paint in her hand.
and after about ten minutes I thought what the devil is she doing in there!
No, she only had the three children, erm Asthana was n't born.
That was it.
I thought, what's she doing in there?
Tha that's right, she was pregnant was n't she, after.
Asthana was n't born when she left here.
Mm mm.
No, go well perhaps it was n't long after Asthana was born.
Anyway, it was, it was in the winter.
Erm.
It is, you know.
I think Asth.
No, Januar.
Janu.
it's January the seventh.
Asthana's birthday, she must be two.
Oh!
They moved before Christmas.
Aye.
Well, whatever.
And er well that might have been it, A Asthana might have been a tiny baby.
So I went along there cos I thought if she was painting the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on and no.
heating.
So I went down, and she was, she was painting the bathroom ceiling.
And I said er, I'll take the children back to my house with me, at least they'll be warm, I can give them a drink or something.
So they came back but of course, if it's jus if it's been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's, it, when I took, when Elsie called up to me, come and look at this, the bathroom ceiling was black mould!
Oh no.
Perhaps he's been and washed it off again.
Sometimes when he comes.
through.
But nobody, how long is it since the last time we showed them in?
And the key's still on our kitchen windowsill so.
Oh yes, but but look how quickly Marie sold hers.
Oh it was beautiful!
Some of them are sold quite quickly.
There's some new people in number ten is it?
They park their car just beside Doug's house.
I do n't see them very much, they tend to use the back door, and sort of come out and then go down.
the back lane.
I do n't see them come round the front.
You have n't drunk your coffee.
Did you see your mother?
Ee!
The places she's been in the last couple.
of weeks.
If she could only remember where she'd been and how much she's enjoying it while she's actually doing it.
What thing at the chapel?
Mm!
Oh yes!
I'll have to go earlier to see her because they'll be maybe getting her changed for that.
Did n't she want to go?
Or was n't there room?
Er, yes.
Yes.
What had she been drinking?
Oh.
Well your mother would n't want that.
I know.
Your mother does n't remember where she's been as soon as she's, gets out of the minibus.
Tt!
I mean, and she, and.
she asks the same question over and over again.
It's lying around somewhere.
Has she got her colostomy bag back on yet?
Or are they still leaving it off?
How do they take her anywhere if she's got the bag off?
Must, well that's you out.
Well supposing you, if that's okay.
I mean.
it's one thing being in a hospital but to take her somewhere.
enclosed is.
not very fair to her.
I think I read that Blagden was open from half past.
one till half past three or something.
Or was it half past one, where did I put it?
Was it half past one to dusk.
It's not much.
Where is it?
Well you've got so many piles of papers lying around!
Where?
I've got my glasses on, I'll do it, I'll read it.
.You ca n't see without your glasses.
Where?
Oh yeah.
I ca n't see at oh right.
Wait a minute till I switch on the other light.
It's cos it's written on blue paper in tiny print.
Daffodils and arboretum.
products, plant and cake stalls.
Suitable for wheelchairs.
Toilet for disabled.
Tea with home-baked scones and cakes.
Open from one till five.
It still is n't a lot of time if you finish work at quarter past three, and you're not home till.
Oh!
Oh!
Right.
Oh that's okay then.
Sunday, May the third.
Well do you want to go take some of the other patients that day and I'll go as an escort?
On when?
Twelfth of June, your Hazel's birthday.
I've no idea.
Fourth of July's Independence Day.
I do n't think anything's the twelfth of July.
And what are you that day?
Ordinary early?
Quarter past three early?
So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty?
Is that a Sunday at Easter?
You're not gon na drive that bus are you?
Oh!
And does he, does he drive the buses?
Er, the hospital bus like.
that?
Yes, but, if he was willing to drive in his spare ta time, he would have his name down surely?
Would n't he?
Well whatever it's called.
Yeah.
Does he work?
It sounds, it sounds odd saying, oh my husband's just renewed his, it makes it sound as if he has n't had a P S V erm licence for a while.
Cos if he was working, and driving he wo it, surely he would have automatically renewed it?
So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while.
So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before.
If he did n't have the licence, he could n't.
Except, he could have for the minibus of course.
Where's my knitting gone?
Well he would n't need a P S V licence for a pet shop.
Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy and were a roadie.
I ca n't remember what line I was doing.
Blagden?
There are no shops.
at Blagden.
Oh.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
It's a bit far to take her to near Berwick.
Oh.
And Corn Hill on the Tweed's a bit far for you my love.
There's Anwick.
Howick at Anwick.
Where's Hallington?
Oh!
Wait a minute.
Between Colwell and Kirkharl.
Was n't it Kirk oh no it was Katheaton.
Was it Ka.
Yeah.
That's right.
We never did find his house did we?
If there's any.
if there's any remnants of his house.
There was certainly no indication of it anywhere in the village.
There was n't even anybody to ask!
We could walk there.
Yeah.
Is n't there?
Well how many houses are on that road?
There's only.
Yeah.
Did you tell me what did they call the one who lived there?
That worked with you.
Yeah.
Di.
Oh that's right.
Where is she?
I used to see her in the hairdressers sometimes.
I know.
I remember that.
Mm.
Oh dear.
She was nice, she was a nice woman.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Did n't know that.
I nearly stood on a grouse once, when we were walking up I was n't walking with you, it was when we were with the Footpath Society.
Got the shock of my life!
I was walking along talking to Mika I think and it just shot up from in front of me, I had my foot out.
It waited till the very last second.
I could n't believe it!
Perhaps it decided to stay put and I would n't notice it was there and maybe at the last second it decided it would run for it!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well Edith told me that erm.
as soon as she bought her house do you know which is her house?
What did you go there for?
Oh maybe, a Christmas.
card it would be.
Cos that, the, you know the le.
you know at the left hand side of her house they've planted some trees.
Yeah.
But there was already no.
It's at the oh!
No, the back of her house opens has erm.
The back of her house, the back garden erm, faces onto a field.
There's the fence.
o over the fence from that, er, the back garden is the field, but.

but to the left of their house, when you're facing the front door to the left.
the there are some trees.
Outside.
There are some erm trees there.
there was already quite a few trees there, it was like a small wood and they've plan and.
they've planted some extra ones.
I think they've planted some.
fruit trees.
It's a huge garden!
So they've got a.
wood in it.
but from the time they moved in she noticed red squirrels.
I think she said she'd seen a badger as well.
No.
Yes I mean, that's right.
Well yes.
Mhm.
She's gone to California, Edith.
I met her erm.
Yes.
I do n't know if she's gone alone or with some, or with a friend, but er she said she wanted to, she'd never been to California and she wanted to go before she was too old and crotchety to get there because David's he's in no fit state to go anywhere any more.
So she asked, she asked if sh her sister-in-law cos Sheila's living er near her daughter.
Well, so.
and somewhere near Berwick, yes.
Ladyki no they moved from Ladykirk into Berwick I think.
And Sheila, erm.
Oh, your glass where've you, have you picked your glasses up?
Seeing as you frequently forget them.
What?
Oh.
If they're not, if they do n't, if it does n't get sufficient light, the leaves turn all green.
it's proper name's erm, er Schefflera.
Schefflera something like that.
Yes.
if it's been standing on the floor though, only the top leaves would, I do n't know what to do about having it there though, that's right above the radiator, it'll dry it out that's, that's why I said.
do you think we should stand it on some gravel in the saucer there's plenty of gravel.
oh I'll go and put some in after, when you've gone to work.
Yes, but when we first got it the radiator was n't on it was the summer time.
it was erm it was bought for us in July ah July.
ca n't remember which July.
It did n't, we took it in the front room.
I said I thought it was that.
Why?
Well put it on the draining board and I'll wash it and then put it back.
Mhm, mhm.
mm, bye.
It's okay, it's just, let's get me bag in, thank you.
I've got a T-shirt under this.
huge long jumper.
Hang on a minute, let's see, oh very nice why did you get that?
Aha, I should have this seatbelt fastened should n't I?
I do n't know, I mean unless you.
it's a daft place to have an antique shop is n't it, where there's no other shops?
It's, it's.
erm some of it is, but I mean, some of the things like that washing machine from about.
nineteen ten by the look of it.
and the great big photograph of Queen Victoria but they do have some nice things in, some of the crockery was quite nice.
I do n't know, I've never been in it, I've just looked through the window and then they've got junk, I mean that, that er.
that erm modelled bull.
well that's some.
someone's obviously brought, obviously brought from Spain, from a holiday, who wants a secondhand bull from Spain?
Aha.
I suppose they do yes.
yeah.
George the fifth.
yes.
ah.
I've got some Coronation mugs somewhere, I've got some that er my grandmother had.
Right next door to the pub.
it's got a very, very old oak staircase in that house because erm.
Er, no, there's Joanna one of the girls I look after and er Rebecca who lives next door to me, erm some friends of ours years ago were going to, were thinking of buying it, it was about five thousand pounds then, so it shows ya how long ago it is.
er, but it needed quite a few repairs doing to it.
it had one of those.
it had, erm one of them cast iron baths you know in the middle of the bathroom with the sort of er curly legs, Queen Anne type legs on it.
they said it was very nice, but, the, they reckoned then it needed about another five thousand pounds spending on it.
Oh yes, yes.
Yes, lift the seat up then please Chris.
Why do you?
I've got some in my bag actually.
I'll show ya, here are.
Close the door so your mum can lock it.
Oh, our front passenger seat wo n't lock either, you've got to lock it from the inside, ta.
Thanks, can you stick that in my shove it, shove it in my bag.

The Green er the Lib Dem is Brian oh he's a horrible man.
he's one of these men who stand up and talk whether they've got anything to say or not you know at at meetings.
not, not just political meetings, any kind of a meeting he gets.
up and spouts, and a lot of it's a load of rubbish.
and he's got such a superior attitude, I feel like spitting at him yes, she got that yesterday.
We surely do n't want any more Tories in.
What do you think's happened to the Health Service?
Have you talked to a nurse recently?
Oh.
just talk to them, just so short staffed, I do n't know when Jim last got off duty on time.
the last time he should have finished at quarter to one he got off about half past one mm.
They ca n't, because of all the wards that are closed, because there are n't enough nurses.
They can train, there's plenty training, but when you've finished your training there's nowhere.
there's no jobs, look at erm Sunderland.
Sunderland General out of the last thirty something that trained, two got jobs.

How long are you going for?
Mm, mm where you trying to go with that Zimmer?
I did n't see any television last night.
I was trying to catch up on housework.
Are you trying to impersonate a monkey or what?
She's crawling round and round the bars of this Zimmer.
Hmm.
Well are n't you?
What makes you think you're not?
oh.
whoops.
Mm, mm.
Oh.
She's making jokes.
Aha.

I do n't know.
Oh yes.
And do you think you'll like it?
I'm sure you will.
Aye, we was, yeah.
mm.
Fred.
No.

Were schools smaller when you were at school though?
It was certainly, the grammar school.
I went to only had er there was about between twenty five and thirty in each year and there was only form for each year so I say.
say there were a hundred and say, say there were thirty in a class, five forms is a hundred and fifty.
and er.
there was about twenty yeah.
there was two two hundred at the most and that covered fourteen small towns and small villages and mind some of them were very small villages.
came from quite a wide area way up in the hills Airedale and all that area, at the foot of the Cleveland hills.
I think there's thirteen hundred at the high school in Morpeth, well yes they come from Rothbury.
in fact there was one boy Les, Les actually lived fifty seven miles from the school he lived er, what was his address?
Something, his father was a shepherd, his mother actually did bed and breakfast, she was on television about five years ago, she'd actually got electricity I think it was.
erm both he, he became a shepherd when he left school as well, erm something.
was Pennine Way was his address.
but, he actually lodged in Rothbury well that was fifteen miles to come each day.
When he was at school, but he used to go home for the Christmas holidays and nobody saw him again till about March cos he was, he could n't even get to Rothbury he was snowed in.
It would of just, it would have been, if he had n't been that he, you know that he had to go to a school in Northumberland, he was just as near.
or possibly nearer to Scottish well he went home at weekends.
It's, it's just the same as the kids from er, say erm.
that's you she's talking to mum.

That's the cardigan we bought you for Christmas.
it's a jacket cardigan.
You need a bib mother.
At the Methodist church.
the mad hatters tea party.
You ca n't, you ca n't go with that one you spilt your dinner down.
That's her excuse.
Oh I will have one please, thank you.
I always end up with a dry throat in here with all this heat.
Mm.
It's just me paper I'm marking me rose on.
Here have a sweet they're there beside her.
It's a pad Uncle Jim gave me.
That's supposed to be a picture of your intestines, that's your stomach that's your duodenum.
that's your.
that's your large intestine that's your small intestine.
Does n't look very nice does it?
mm, mm.
on the on the wrong side.
Why do n't you move this Zimmer and sit on the seat?
And tell me what you've been doing all the week.
Have you done anything exciting?
No, I'll tell you how far the rain affected us personally, you know the, well the antique shop at the end of our road.
you know there are steps go up it.
behind it.
well they go up at the side of it and down behind it.
down and there's a path goes along and it comes, it goes under the road bridge and it comes out at the foot bridge and it runs next to it.
the water got up to the second step from the top, but, when, instead of turning right into my road if you'd keep straight on.
and go along the river, you know where the flood wall is?
that's called Bennetts Walk, Bennetts Walk was all flooded, that was closed off.
but that was n't with flood water coming over, that was because it was coming up the drains, cos it could n't drain into the river.
so those houses were all sandbagged, but it, it got into some, the problem was that the, the road closed sign kept blowing down in the wind, I tried to stand it up but it was oh so heavy, I got it up, but it, it immediately blew down again, and.
people could n't see that it was water there.
sort of going just a short way along and having to reverse back out again.
mm.
from the.
some, er when one of the.
when the father of one of the children came.
he said has flooded.
yeah.
Thur er Wednesday and Thursday the children I have before and after school at Goose Hill School, you know the one, the one near me, just the bottom of the road on the corner, that's had to be closed on Thursday because the boiler room had flooded on Wednesday and er they had to dry it out and also the children from Newminster were told anyone living in the Middle Queens area go home.
They must send them home at erm they must of sent them home about quarter to three, because they got home at quarter past.
No Newminster is the one along Midford road the one in the same grounds at Chantry.
if you were going.
Yes.
Yes, well, they, they, they thought it.
yeah, the, the, the erm, they share the same school gate.
you go up along drive in and Newminster is on your left and Chantry is on your right, at, but I should imagine erm I should imagine that quite a lot of Chantry School children would be sent home because they're for the children outside of Morpeth, you know they go there from.
and er, where else?
Do they go there from Nether Witham?
Yes they'll go there from Midford and of course the water was well, well up.
into the gardens, the back gardens of the houses in Midford Road.
and the greenhouses.
There's a big tree was wedged on er, I do n't know if it's still there on Friday, I took a trip up to see it.
Oh heck erm under the er.
Under the er old gate bridge.
the was flooded and the house.
No the one from the Joiners that footbridge.
that was closed off on er.
you know where the clock you know where the clock tower is?
Go past the clock tower.
and that's the old gate bridge, that nice big stone one, the newest one.
you go over to the club.
that's right.
Yes.
and it was it was over the footbridge you know when you go into Morpeth instead of turning.
right to go into go into Goose Hill.
to come to my house, when you go over that bridge there's one further over on the left just a footbridge from the Joiners.
through to Chantry Place.
that bridge was closed off it was up to there.
Yes, that was closed off.
I do n't know if the I did n't see the water over it because we went, Jim and I went out at about erm ten o'clock.
It's a heck of a way down.
that's right, with.
I do n't watch it pet, and er, when was it Wednesday night?
And we went, because it, it'd been at five o'clock you see, it'd been up to the second, that was when it was up to the second step.
behind the antique shop, and we went along and had a look and at ten o'clock it had dropped right down to the second step from the bottom roughly.
mind it was gon na be a high tide at one o'clock in the morning.
but it would still of had to risen.
a heck of a lot to get.
to that level.
Oh it does.
Well you know where the weir is in the park?
that's quite a drop down.
well there was no weir er there, it was just, it was above that.
so you know it was just flowing along smoothly, you could n't see that there was a wi er weir there.
and the bridge near the baths the Elliott bridge.
that was closed off.
I think it was probably the other day because erm the wa the ducks were swimming on the road at er six o'clock just on the road near the baths.
and all the new wood chippings that they'd put er.
Oh so would I.
mm, mm.
What is a horse's favourite television programme?

he should finish at nine or is it, or is it five to nine, I think it's officially five to nine, not that he ever does.
Well.
there are.
occasions when er I want to discuss something seriously.
with him, I I sarcastically make an appointment.
There was once years and years ago, he came in one night and I gave him these three pieces of paper and er what was it?
He said what's this?
I said it's an application in triplicate I'm go I'd erm, I forgotten what it was I was going to buy and I said I wanted to discuss this with you and when we can go and get it.
I think I probably decided what it was more or less, but er he got quite stroppy.
Ann can be funny sometimes, I can take a joke ca n't I?
I thought it was quite a good joke myself.
Yes dear anyway the rest of them.
have gone to Belfast by the way.
I did n't see last Sunday did I?
Cos we came in the morning.
No.
Shirley said she would n't believe he was n't going until he did n't go and all the rest of them had gone.
No but I watched, I watched the programme on erm training the Paras.
Oh it sickens you does n't it?
Oh yes swear at them.
there's no doubt about that they swear at him.
I can remember when Gareth did his initial Para training, even though that, that they wear vest and a T-shirt and one of those thick army shirts.
and erm, you know that the erm padded er what do they call it?
You know the camouflage jacket, what did he call it?
Ca n't remember, anyway that.
even though they had that on, with having to march and run, and he were doing these fifteen miles half, well sort of jogging and running and with the forty.

Where do I get car mats for Jim's car?
Yes.
I want some car mats for his birthday.
He's on yes, he's only getting a little present cos I'm still paying for his camcorder till next month.
Where's that?
Mayes.
Oh right up the top of Newgate Street?
Cos you have to get special mats for special cars, do n't you?
Do n't you?
Oh.
I just wondered because we were in Winners once and it had some and he picked them up and he looked at them and he said I do n't think these are the right shape for my car and I know he needs some.
Oh yes but erm.
I ca n't remember how much they were.
I did n't know if you had to go to er a special Fiat garage or what?
Oh.
Yes.
Yeah I was.
Mhm.
Yes, it was nice to see her was n't it?
Well I knew that.
I met Edith the day before she was going.
She said erm according to Sheila, David's not as bad as, as Edith says he is.
But Edith said to me.
Does he?
I have n't seen him Oh!
I must've been out at the wrong time.
No.
She said he's most upset because he ca n't drive any more, erm.
Yes.
Well, were you making one now?
Oh, half a one please, Paul!
Half a cup please!
I'll just go an lock me door then.
Right.
Er yes I'm going to get these car mats.
Well if that's where I'm going to I would n't be able to get the triple buggy into that shop, would I?
It's only a small shop, is n't it?
Anyway, it's better to go today.
It's too far to walk them and it's, it's up hill all the way in that, with that chariot.
Yes.
Besides which, if I ca n't get any I'll have to think of something else.
Right, I'll go and lock me door.
Which is mine?
Ooh!
Does n't sound very hopeful.
Does erm Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and things as well as vegetables?
I'm looking, I want somebody who knows something about gardening.
I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned up its toes.
Oh.
Oh.
I'll try.
I know.
yeah.
Thank you.
Is it lit?
Well they're both in tubs, they're both planted in ericaceous compost which is what we were told.
When we fed them before the winter we gave them proper er fertilizer for things that need acid soil.
I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns the leaves brown and kills off the buds, but why is only one affected?
And as soon as it's.
No.
They're the same kind exactly but they're different colours that's all.
They're both in, they're both in wooden half barrels.
Erm I think some do but some are evergreen and these are evergreen.
Well, yeah I think some do.
They're not big enough to prune yet.
They're, they're about er.
eighteen inches.
No i it's er.
It said in the gardening book.
It did n't say much about them.
Really it's about, you know, huge erm rhododendrons, it's only a little bit at the end of that.
But erm.
you know that er polythene that's got wire netting in between it like a, like a wire netting sandwich with po with clear polythene on the outside?
We bent some of that round the windward side of the barrel.
and I, and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on.
So it's been sheltered from the wind.
We've made sure.
Oh God, next door's cats.
Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went, as Sheila was going erm Jackie was in her garden.
and I was telling her that that was the daughter-in-law of Mrs who lived there before.
Graham did.
and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and.
oh, and er the cat was lurking around however, it had gone somewhere else.
I ca n't.
Oh never mind I'll drink half of it.
Yeah, azaleas.
It just says, where is it?
Lime-free soil plus large quantities of peat or leaf mould.
Some shade during the heat of the day.
Er it does n't get any.
Erm when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it only gets, oh and the other thing is, you, er it, it does n't say here but you're supposed to, it's supposed to be somewhere where they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been.
a frost.
Oh we've had frost we have n't any early morning sun anyway.
Thank you.
I gave it some water cos I.
Yeah but.
I know it's, it's just turning up its toes.
How much are car mats, Paul?
Mm I can afford that.
Yes they are small cos I got them.
to go in these half barrels.
Well it's against the garage wall.
It said in my book just tidy them up if you, you know, if they needed a bit of tidying up.
That's more or less what it said in my book except erm they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a frost.
Well we've had plenty of frosts but there's been no early morning sun.
I know there's been wind.
but er.
Yeah.
Yes.
And the, they're beside the garage facing towards the kitchen.
and the sun always comes along the side of the house.
I can tell because me, me washing always blows towards the gate, to the back gate.
right?
Erm so that must be, that's south over there is n't it?
Well it should be a south wind, it's not even a north wind.
Yes, that's right.
Hang on.
Wait a minute, wh which, which direction's Scot oh me nose.
Yes.
Well it's coming along the side of the house along there.
Yeah.
Yes.
But it's only about er what's in between the two barrels?
Th the, th you know that erm small cauldron with er primroses in?
That's all that's separating them, I mean they're close together.
and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the other one looks perfectly healthy.
Good cup of coffee that.
I said it's a good cup of coffee that.
Thank you Paul!
Oh!
Oh yes now.
I think Edith.
Well what about erm Kathleen's Jenny is seventeen!
Yes.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Oh yes she was very keen was n't she when she used to come and stay with her Grandma?
You ca n't do that without A levels.
Yes.
Yeah oh.
And Jennifer's doing er did she say history and politics?
Aha, yeah.
Mm so he must be twenty.
four, five?
Oh and is Ann still in Kenya?
I did n't ask her any of it.
Er yes.
Well I thought Edith said she came across at Christmas cos if you remember, we've always sent her Christmas cards to her house in, near Harrogate have n't we?
Well we did n't know where else to send them.
But I'm sure.
You know when er the fir when we went up to Edith's, when she'd first moved in, for.
coffee?
Did n't Edith say then that Ann came across for Christmas?
To be with the children, mm.
Oh yes it will be.
No she's be erm Edith moved in was it January or February?
That's right because we got a card in the, in our Christmas card saying that they were moving back to.
and er they hope to be in by January the something?
Yeah, oh cos that's when she said Frank, Frank only came for a short while or something?
So he does n't have to pay taxes.
Yes.
Oh what's Paul doing?
Oh I wa I was wa.
I was watching for him erm I'd been to the loo and I glanced out the er landing window and I thought it looked too tall for you.
I thought it was his shape moving behind your kitchen net curtain and er I thought oh I'll dash and ask him now about those car mats so I can go and get them.
Yes.
Well this is, this is why I thought perhaps erm I did n't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying them for him you see.
And I remember this time in Winners when he, he picked them up and looked at them and said I do n't think these are the right ones for my car and that, that's why I thought.
and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in that sells, sells things like that or do you have to go to a garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit.
shop was one now.
Yeah.
Mm.
You mean if they have n't got any I'll have to make a model.
I bought him one Christmas years and oh hey, we were just married and I ordered him an extending ladder from the Co-op.
and I ordered it in November, it finally came in February.
So I bought.
him something else for Christmas, something smaller and I made him a model out of matchsticks and I said this is the prototype.
of your Christmas present!
I.
I, I just sort of made erm two short ladders about two inches long.
I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to, so I could stick the.
matchsticks together and then I stuck one half on top of the other to make it look like an extending ladder.
Yes.
Er Wednesday.
Yes.
He's always telling me all the best people are born in April.
Oh yes.
I'll tell you who else is the first of April as well.
Mrs at this end of the old people's bungalows.
Oh.
I'll tell you why he's probably not going to be on the mar market committee because his daughter had a.
jewellery stall.
This is.
She's on the council, the town council, his daughter.
Fiona yes.
According to Jim she's never opened her mouth and said a single thing yet but er.
Yes.
Well I suppose he's had a lot of flack, I mean look at the.
everyone says if you want a council house in you've got to.
you've got to join the Liberal Party and you've got to be related to Ian.
But let's face it.
well all his three children got houses at, at eighteen.
None.
of them married.
and when when this one who's got the market stall was pregnant.
she gave up her flat and went to live with her mother.
When she was pregnant again, I think the father by then was divorced so she married him, she immediately got a house.
no, she had a house to start with.
When you think of all the families on the waiting list.
and single eighteen year olds being given.
houses it's, it's, they left themselves wide open for.
people to.
Yes.
Mm.
It is.
Stupid.
But remember when.
Are you?
Oh yeah.
I forgot to check wha if Jim's got a meeting tonight.
If he has I've got to think of something to cook that he can finish off cooking so he can eat it before I get back from aerobics so I can stick mine in the microwave to warm up.
Yes, I mean it.
it does n't need to be absolutely freshly cooked.
Yes.
No this is why I ca I do n't know if you remember, but erm she was interviewed by a reporter, Fiona and she, i when the market traders were all on strike and you know all those months the.
er and there was only the two fruit stalls there.
and occasionally the fish st well.
yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall, she said er the market, the market had n't ceased trading, trading, it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well!
Cos I thought, I.
thought where have you been?
I mean there had been how many?
Ninety was it?
Sometimes a hundred.
And er four stalls at the most there and according to her it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it.
I thought, and then I happened to go, Jim came to carry the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again, and there was she with this, I looked at Jim and I said ah!
That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall.
I have n't had a proper look around the market for I looked.
I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables, if Jim's on the right shift he takes them home, otherwise I buy them while it's quieter, the man keeps them for me, I go straight across the leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and then on the way back one of them walks.
and I put the fruit and vegetables in the buggy and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then.
I'll have another cigarette and then I must dash.
What time are you to go up?
Dorothy was telling me this morning you know when we were at erm nursery?
That's lit erm I heard Mrs you've got your hands full there.
Dorothy told me why.
She'd er Mrs had asked James to close the cupboard and he called her a stupid idiot.
Yes.
Oh that's gone out.
And now Martin's taught him to call people stupid zombie so Dorothy's not pleased.
Yes.
Well her boys are quite amenable really but erm.
Bryony you know.
the tantrum screaming carries on when she does n't want her coat on to go out.
I mean.
if she.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Yeah Bryony went if you, well she's not so bad now she's got over that phase where she refused to have her coat on, but if you're trying to get her ready erm and she does n't want to get ready, she'll say either go away or do n't do that to me if I'm trying to get her coat on.
And and James sometimes says I do n't want to hear that!
Well she says it's not her and I do n't remember saying that.
I mean, no if he says something that I do n't like I usually say oh that's not very nice is it?
But if er if I'm s if I say to him you're not, you're not eating properly, sit up and, you know, pu bring your plate near to you.
I do n't want to hear that!
Tt oh!
Erm they'll go a year in, wait a minute.
They'll go a year come September, wo n't it?
Yes.
April, May, June, July, August, September they'll be four in five months.
by then.
When you think it does n't seem five minutes ago.
that the tiniest.
Well they was.
well James especially, the, the tiniest Baby-gro.
his feet came down to the knees on it.
and they had Bryony in, I'm sure it was a doll's dress.
you know when they were two days old, Trevor took me through to the hospital.
Who?
That's funny.
Jim said that to me yesterday and I said is n't he on holiday?
That, that.
Jim said to me last night is er Jimmy h is he not working?
I have n't noticed.
Oh!
Oh.
I wonder if erm Shirley's sister's working because she often meets her nieces yes her nieces from school and she has her nephew with her, you know, Judith's.
No I.
Oh she remarried.
She's.
she's got, yes, have you seen her.
eldest daughter,.
Ruth, you know the one I used to look after?
Well, when she first left her husband she moved in with Shirley.
and er how did they all fit in that house?
Cos there was Shirley and Jimmy, and Ann and Sarah, and Judith, and Ruth and Christopher, and Christopher was was Christopher nine?
Or was he at road, by then?
Erm Ruth was definitely at Goosehill School.
She's very tall, very slim and very, very attractive.
She's really pretty.
And Christ Christopher's six foot something and a very handsome young man.
Well this is what I was wondering because.
because Shirley seems to have been looking after, anyway she married this Robert.
apparently she used to go out with him before she married Derek, I think her first husband was called.
And now she's got er Rona and Sophie I ca n't remember the boy's name.
I ca n't no, she's got Ruth and Christopher, Judith's the mother.
She's got Ruth, a Shirley's Ann, to me, looks more like Judith than she looks like her mother.
Except of course, Ann's blonde and.
er Shirley's black, or it was.
She seems to have gone very grey very quickly.
You know, really, really quickly.
Mm mm.
No!
Shirley herself.
Yeah, her sister's got slightly lighter hair than, than Shirley had.
But I think they live at Pegswood.
But the other thing is, Judith's husband plays in a band now I'd, I th it might be a pipe band, I'm not sure.
and he travels arou they go or is it a band?
I do n't know, erm but he sometimes goes abroad with it I think, but he, he goes to different parts of the country and Judith goes with him.
I know erm when there was only Ruth and Christopher before Judith had Rona, they sometimes used to come and stay with Shirley.
I would think it would be easier for Shirley to go to their house to look after them now.
But I think, I think.
No, erm the little ones?
Yes.
Well.
I wonder well they did, they certainly were living in Pegswood, but I've noticed when they bring the children to school the car frequently comes along the river way.
So that to come that way.
Or from.
or from up the hill or somewhere, yes.
Or unless they come from Stobb Hill and come by the station and over the crossing.
I know but it's, it's sometimes.
it's sometimes very difficult to.
turn into Goose Hill off erm.
off the main road.
Right, I'd better go and get ready and go and get those car mats.
I know.

Yes.
I'll take the jars.
I've got some jars there's s bottles and things for the erm.
I've still, oh.
I've still got one milk bottle left.
Mm.
Oh!
I did n't know they sold them.
Well take them, take them back.
Is there a crate there or what?
Take them back there.
I wonder if that has, does that milkman still come round here?
Has he got any customers left?
Oh I've heard the milkman.
I've heard bottles rattling early in the morning but I, sort of one o'clock, two o'clock but I had n't.
noticed who it was.
Mm.
Mm mm.

James has been a James today.
I could've throttled them after dinner.
They fought over everything they could think of to fight over they were really niggly!
Well James was.
I thought maybe he was getting the same as Richard and Bryony had had, but he's cheered up.
You have been, James monster.
Yes, we had a carry-on at, at dinner-time.
He would not stop hitting, slapping Richard across the face.
So I, I made him swap places as, er, with Bryony and of course he wou he was n't sitting there!
He was gon na sit in his own seat.
I said you ca n't cos you keep hitting Richard in the face for nothing!
You wo n't let him eat his dinner!
So.
so Richard's crying because he'd been hitting him the face.
He's howling and scr w wailing cos I would n't let him go back in the same chair!
So he ate his tea later and then he said to me I'm not gon na hit him any more.
He did n't at teatime, did you?
And then they just had the bikes and cars to fight over.
Oh, we've been like this all, Amy and Richard tried to tidy it up.
Well I tried to tidy it up before we went to school and they were flinging it all out again and there just was n't time!
So, I shall do it when they've gone home and then I'll, at least I'll know, that it wo n't it wo n't be being undone.
Tomorrow.
I've just put it back on her?
Oh Richard, James, James said can I have the hairbrush out.
I said as long as you do n't go near your sister.
I did n't want to hear everybody running round the hair, room screaming, not having my hair combed, not!
And he's chasing them with a brush and saying, come here, an absolute mess!
He said to her, not today this was a week or two back.
She's going screaming, not get my hair done!
He says come here, come here!
You're an absolute mess!
She can take it with her.
You borrow it.
Yes, you can borrow the train.
Where's she put her shoe?
I've just p is it near the front door because I've just put it back on her.
Oh it's down here.
It's a wooden train.
It's a wooden one it's made of wood that train.
Yes, you're taking it home with you!
Oh.
Oh we've been telling her how pretty she is with her hair cut.
Major operation!
Martin, put the television off please.
Martin, put the television off please, Martin!
Thank you.
Oh, here's Jim back.
Where are your shoes, Martin?
He finishes at quarter-to-one tomorrow.
I think.
Oh, is that it?
I did n't know Jim had recorded one for him.
I knew I recorded one for him and I did n't, I did n't.
know Jim had recorded one.
Well we definitely, I definitely only recorded one.
What's, Bryony dear, what are you saying?
Where's your other one you had two ducks when you, ah, there's one down there look near Hazel's feet.
And I think the other one must be in the car.
We have n't got another video!
I recorded one and he took it home and if Jim had recorded another episode on it I do n't remembering him doing it.
Because you took the recording.
home after.
Well that would make three and we've definitely have not recorded three because there were only two episodes to go when you were upset.
because you were going to miss it.
And I.
recorded it and I sent it home with you.
I did n't know Jim had sent another one, had recorded another one.
Well do n't know where it is cos I did n't, I did n't.
record it.
Where's the car box gone?
Is your mum waiting to put you in the car, Richard?
Can anybody see the car box?
Unless one of them tipped it over.
Oh, it's here.
If I find it I'll it but I, I do n't know of any other recording.
That's just Richard he likes to ring the door bell.
If it was someone else they're hardly likely to ring the door bell with Jim standing beside the front door, are they?
Get your shoes on, Martin, please, your mum's waiting to go home.
Are they here?
That's rubbish.
Puzzles forever.
Have you got your shoes on, Martin?
Right, get your coat it's under Sally's look.
Put your coat on, good lad.
Oh, the wheels are off the tractor I wonder where it is?
And if I can mend it.
What's this in me hand?
Put that in there.
Martin, have you got any books, or s oh he's not here.
Oh, hello.

Did Martin have any, Martin!
Martin, Martin, Martin, did you have any books or anything.

Okay.
What's he doing?
Who's that?
You'll fall out.
You've got to stay fastened in the car.
It's dangerous!
What was that for?
Oh, very good!
You did n't tell me that!
Expect so.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
Well you were n't going to be anyway because you er, oh it's on tonight is it?

I must sit down for two minutes, Jim.
I will.

I need to sit down for three minutes or, me back'll snap in two.
Oh thanks, Hazel.
Now where's that.
Are they?
Well, are they not private roads?
Oh no,.
they're unadopted roads are n't they?
Oh, where does this go?
Oh, I'll put them away later.
They go in the cupboard under the stairs.
Where does this go?
Well you would n't have been able to go if you'd been erm.
Oh I see.
Some of these puzzles, Jim, must've fallen down behind the erm fermenting bin.
I just ca n't get close enough to see.
Some of these things as well, they've been pinching back from upstairs, toys they, they've played with when they were smaller and they do n't play with them now and I put them upstairs out of the way and they keep going and finding them and bringing them down.
That was up, cos they do n't seem to play with that much now.
So have you got all these things delivered now?
How many?
Where?
Which area?
Oh.
Where does that shape go?
Oh, was there?
Is erm Matthew at Matthew.
Oh, well he would n't.
I ca n't remember how old he is.
Ouch!
When I want to sit down and have a cigarette I have n't got any.
Are you at a meeting tonight?
Oh,.
Yes please.
Oh, there's a piece of I should imagine there's bits of puzzles under the chairs anyway.
Sure to be.
Oh!

Mm.

Yes!
So you get yourself down there, then.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes, you do.
Yes.
Well, that's it.
I mean you should have all your friends and neighbours in and have a party!

Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well you wor work on, work on Jim!
I mean Pat said he can go so tell him to get two tickets and you'll go with him.
I do n't know if er.
Mm.
Well our Nick used to have er a red, the red and white scarf and hat and everything.
He had a tie there's drawers full of stuff upstairs belonging to him I do n't know if there's anything in there.
I knit him red and white stripe gloves.
Mm.
Yeah.
Aha.
Mm mm.
Jim, will you go and g, what time does the off-licence shut?
The Victoria Wine.
Cos it's where,.
it's where I get my cigarettes from the Victoria Wine shop.
No, what, he was talking about taxation.
And that er they would be worse off because he said even staff nurses are getting more than twenty thousand pounds a year.
Which of course charge nurses are n't getting anywhere near twenty thousand pounds a year and only a few erm nursing officers.
Yes.
Hague is a.
And of course he had the nurses ' pay.
scale in the other hand while he was ringing them.
Where's me purse?
There you are.
Thanks.

Yes, but that's all very well but, bout, but er.
That's right!
So there's half the country thinking staff nurses are earning well over twenty thousand are owning, earning over twenty thousand.
Your Pat said to me on Sunday while I was talking to her, she said, when she was saying oh well she does n't know whether to vote Tory because.
she's done quite well under them.
As Jim said, in six months time if he's redundant she wo n't be feeling.
the same.
But she said, I said oh.
I said oh Pat just, just, I said have you spoken to a nurse recently?
You know, how demoralised they are and the state of the hospitals and things and she said, oh well, nurses er, they, they've always complained that they're hard up and,.
and the rest of it.
So, talk some sense into her will you?
Just point out that they might be redundant and.
That was another thing he said, was n't it?
That they privatized erm ambulance service, they're now the highest paid in the country.
and Jim, Jim's got their pay scale and, and.
They're being paid,.
they're being paid less than the N H S.
ones!
And that's, you know, anybody listening to that on the television would think, oh yes, that's true!
You know it's, it's.
once it's stuck in their head then it's like reading things in the newspapers.
Er, fort well if you, if you manage to get to Victoria Wines in time er, get me erm, er twenty erm no, get me forty er Emb what do they call them?
Elite, please?
If you've got ta go to the Co-op, just get me twenty of whatever's there is.
If you get to the Victoria Wine in time.
I do n't know if he will.
I do n't know if it shuts at five o'clock or what they do or if evening staff come on?
I've never tried to go after five o'clock.
No, she was n't thinking, well she was n't exactly thinking about a Tory vote.
She said, well I, I do n't know what to do, she said, I have n't read, you know, she had n't read the election, she had n't had time to read the election addresses, and she's not really interested in ac actually so she has n't watched it on the television.
And I said, oh Pat, you do n't want a Tory government in a again, do you?
And she said, well, I I I do n't know, she said, you know we've done alright under them.
What does she think's happening to education?
What does she think's ha happening to the hospitals?
Put your daughter straight!
Mm mm.
The unemployed certainly have n't been better off.
The young people leaving school have n't been better off.
Yeah.
That's right.
And is n't it a hundred, hundred and, hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year?
I mean they keep saying we've given the all, all these opportunities to all these.
small businessmen and there's a hundred and fifty.
Mm.
No.
Paul next door left school, you know, he cou all he wanted to be was a mechanic, it's, it's all he's ever been, he's really good.
But he's learnt from his father.
and he could n't a job and then, I me I mean, he tried for apprenticeships all over the place and other jobs and he just could n't get one!
When his father died, when he was twenty- one, he took over the erm taxi business.
Well it was private hire, but most of the work came from Northgate Hospital.
You know they, they ran, they took the nurses, because the nurses home was a mile or, was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital, they had this, they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them, and they had the schools run as well.
And then, of course the er, they started running down Northgate hospital and they closed down the nurses home.
So there was half his business worked out, wiped out in one go.
And then erm, his schools run was way up into the country, quite a long way and then that was changed.
First of all th the erm registration went up, then something else went up and then two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gon na be paid much less than that.
Well the ordinary private hire, there's so many of them, I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up.
He could n't compete!
And, and then finally the council said, he actually had an Austin Princess, but you know Paul and his cars that that nineteen, I do n't know what it is the car he's got in his garage now, but he buys old cars and completely rebuilds them, it looks like a new car now and he ha he had an Austin Princess which, which actually it was a P reg and er they told him he could n't run the service unless he bought a much newer car.
And he could n't do it, because, the pair of them, I mean, that was, that business was supporting his mother as well and between them, after they'd paid for the petrol, they were taking in less than a hundred pounds a week and that was for the two of them.
So he could n't keep it going any longer and he had to give it up, so he's on the dole again.
It's about oh, it's, it's over a year since he packed in and he's tri applied for hundreds of jobs.
He's applied for jobs in Washington and.
you know it's quite.
a long way to travel to.
but see you just get nothing.
He wrote to Nissan.
That was one of the places he.
wrote to.
Yes.
Thirty thousand.
Mm mm.
Yes.
Yes.
They say unemployment's hitting the south now but I wonder how many jobs they get that thirty thousand apply for?
Yeah.
The teaching, teaching jobs are the same.
Hundreds and hundreds applying for teaching jobs.
Rubbish.
Is that rubbish?
What's this?
Something from.
No.
Nope!
There's bits of paper everywhere you look.
Whose key's this?
That's not your key, is it?
I'm sure it's not mine.
Jim's is on his car keyring, I'll put it there until I find out.
Unless it was a loose one that was lying on here cos Richard was.
Oh, I've got,.
oh, I've got, I've.
I've got keys to these, there's an old lady opposite, I've got keys for her erm front door and back door.
She's got a, I think er has she got a no, I do n't think she's got a key to my house now, she used to have er in case I lock meself out.
And Betty had, but that.
then we got the new front door so only Betty now has got er, a spare backdoor key which was n't much good the day I bolted the door into the kitchen!
Could only get as far as the kitchen.
Yes.
There's something extremely sticky on this windowsill.
Urgh!
It's all claggy.
I do n't know what they've had on there, I'll have to wash it off properly.
Oh.
Well if they've applied in time they can get a p postal vote.
Er or they can ask for someone to take them.
Jim's actually running people from Comfort House there.
Someone er asked it was someone who was deliving, delivering the erm election the polling cards.
He'd been helping his wife to, she must work for the council and he'd been helping her and he said er the matron at Comfort House had asked and he, and he'd noticed Jim's name on when he delivered ours so he knew where they could, he'd take them.
The only thing is in a place like that they're more likely to be Tory.
However, Jim says he'll take them.
It's er, a private nursing home do you know where the library is?
You go past past the library past the ambulance station and round the corner.
Oh, the clinic, yes, yes, yes.
No, it's further round than that.
If you go, if you actually.
Fruit and vegetables back.
Do you know whose car was stolen from this road last week?
Oh.
Cost Kathy down the road was telling me that erm a Yugo car had been stolen from Alexandra Road.
Last week.
I do n't know anyone who's got a Yugo car do you?
I do n't know.
But apparently it was stolen last week.
No.
Aha.

Aha.
Is that the erm cardio func.
or the er what is it?
Is there a lot of high impact in it?
Oh.
Yes.
I go to Maxine's erm intermediate class.
I would n't be able to do the you know the really high very high impact.
They.
Yeah.
And apart from the fact that you're less than half my age.
It helps does n't it?
Although the intermediate class most of them seem to be teenagers and twenties.
There's a few thirties and there's a couple I think probably in their forties but when it comes to the high impact they do n't do it they just step it out you know.
Erm.
But the.
the advance class on a the first one on a Friday morning is nearly all high impact.
There are very few floor exercises.
Well I would n't be able to do that.
But I can keep up with the intermediate class and I said to Maxine, Does this get any harder?
And she said, No we do different exercises but there's this amount of high impact.
So.
Oh what's the mat.
Is he?
Oh.
Have a look at have a look at baby Daniel.
Have a look at him.
See if he'll have a look at you.
There.
Is he a tired boy?

Aha.

She's had it cut.
Yeah.
It was.
And it was so tangly.
And she would n't have it brushed and she was shaking her head about when you tried to brush it so.
She's lost all her curls from the bottom of it.
I do n't know if it'll come back.

One at each side boys please.
Bryony if you get your foot underneath it like you did before when you kicked the footrest down and then your foot went underneath the buggy and you screamed did n't you?
You ca n't swing on the buggy handle it makes it too heavy and it makes it tip up.
James hold your side please.
There.
The moorhen one moorhen Bryony.
Wait a minute cos Bryony wants to see moorhens.
Let's see if we can look.
Where.
Let me see if I can get Bryony to see where this moorhen is.
Can you see that tree branch, move along a little bit Richard.
That's right it's in the bott the trees hanging the branch is hanging right down to the river and the moorhen's standing on it.
That's right.
But I ca n't see any more moorhens and there's usually a few more round if there's one.
But I ca n't see them.
Right then let's get in a line again.
In a line again.
Yes we're going yes you can see it as well.
Yes it is it's over there that's right.
There we are.
You want to see the birds.
Well in that case no there Richard Richard means the birds in the park in the aviary.
We we ca n't go and see.
Listen.
Yes that's what kind's that one Bryony?
Bryony says she can see one in the sky.
What is it can you remember?
That's right it's a seagull.
There's another seagull.
That's a black-headed gull that one.
Yes it's a white one with a black head.
You want to see the birds in the park.
The trouble is.
Yes but but I ca n't push this buggy up that very very very steep hill to get down the other side to the birds.
Is n't it beautiful.
I am.
I am.
They want to go up to the aviary but I I ca n't get I ca n't get this buggy up there up that hill.
Listen we'll come.
Yes cos we we can walk easily.
We can easily.
Oh I hope so.
Oh yes.
You would n't think it was the same month would you?
Yes that's the weir.
You want to see what?
But I've just explained about five times.
To go to the one in the park we'd have to go up that hill and there's no way I can push this buggy with Bryony in the front and all these fruit and vegetables I could n't get up and the hang on to you two with your reins I could n't get up that steep hill.
So the best thing to do the best thing to do listen.
No Bryony I'm telling you you listen I'm telling you.
The best thing to do would be to come tomorrow and we'll walk there without the buggy.
We can easily walk there and we can come in the front we can come in the front gates of the park and we do n't have to go up great big steep hills do we?
Just a minute.
