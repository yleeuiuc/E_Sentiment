it's going to take a lot of fabric both sides and the back.
Full length of the back of the chairs across the seat.

You know.
That's mine there, I've got mine out.
Sun's trying to come out.

Mm mm Ah look batteries.
I'm sure it's in Pauline's garden because I've seen a few times.
E T mm watching that.
Do n't you dare.
They look like pink flowers on there do n't they?
Must be the leaves I think because I do n't think it flowers this shrub here.
Mm.
That dogwood I moved I'm hoping it's gon na be alright cos it does n't s show much sign of life at the moment.
Oh I put it down the other end.
Mm.
Well think, did n't she give up last year? she said something about it last year on radio, on no smoking day.

It's a lot though is n't it?
Should be.
about four a week four a day Mm.
Mm well we have n't seen any this year have we really?
Yeah too late to be serious.
I was wrapped up to the eyes when I went u down to put my walking boots on as well because they're comfortable and there were people going going round in their shellsuits and you know I must be feeling the cold more now.
I do n't think I'd have been warm enough in a shellsuit.
Now it's on, the light comes on does n't it when it's on?
Ooh!
So I've left that form there for you to erm.
Oh do, do you want these bin bags?
Oh.

Is n't there any at all?
Oh.
How is it?
I mean they are at the moment and if I have a meeting well after about an hour it seems as though you've.
working.
They have, yes they're er they're good value those a pot, I mean but they're reasonably when did you get it?
It must be about three weeks ago.
I think it was one of those impromptu ones.
I know it was n't my birthday you just came in with it did n't you?
Must have had a brainstorm.
I do n't I do n't know.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden eventually.
No, well not this year anyway, they they could.
Have you got, oh ta look take this as well.
Oh.
I'm going to have a go at this today.
They've dried out a bit, been too tacky to do anything with.
No see you then.
Well he's, he actually was off the lead and he went straight through right to the other gate.
Oh yes well the gate was open so.
so she went into the second field.
I'm not going.
carried on for a while realized in the end he had to come back.
Bye, see you later.
Switch that on while you're.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
Yes.
I did phone her a few weeks ago and she said, ooh I'll have to see you on Friday in Mould you know get a.
a bit of a coffee but er.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Still working?
Oh.
Is she still working at.
or.
Yeah.
I, I thought she'd no, she went.
she went to Lesher did n't.
she?
I'm sure somebody told me that she was working with the trainee at er.
Oh did she?
Oh!
Ooh dear, so er.
In between.
Oh!
Mm.
No, I I think it was somebody I was talking to from Bretford who said that she'd gone she was looking after the.
trainees in Leighbridge Do you remember when they had them.
For so many months I think did n't they?
And then cos I said, ooh are, are they going to open up again?
But er but it has n't has it?
And nobody's taken the place over have they?
Oh, boarded up the street?
The, the access roads, yeah.
Do, oh!
What a shame!
I mean.
The whole village relied on that.
did n't they for.
work?
I wonder what.
Too old to get another job!
No, when are you having driving lessons?
Is that another story is it?
Is n't he terrible!
Is he.

Bit like.
Oh.
You really.
Yeah.
Does Yvonne go out with you or.
Yeah.
Oh God, yeah!
How's she doing anyway still in er.
?
Oh good!
Project two thousand.
that's right yeah.
Yeah yeah it.
it's.
It's strange well erm I mean with, Bon's just qualified now and she trying to get a job down in Portsmouth but erm you know they're not they do n't.
seem to be recruiting at the moment.
But erm she was saying there were a group that she sort of went were alongside their group which were the.
Project two thousand, but it it seems to be mostly class work and very.
little practical work, whereas the group she was in you know, it was so many weeks of school but the majority.
of it was actually on the ward is n't it?
No.
Well.
Yeah.
Which I mean for er for a hospital taking people on like that, I mean erm I would of said i it would would of been a better proposition to have somebody who's at least experienced.
Yeah.
No.
No.
That's.
right yeah.
There's no incentive at all is there?
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
That's terrible is n't it?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
So she could drop.
It's just ridiculous.
So they've got ta go through that waiting period before you.
build up to the.
Oh dear!
She'll have to put a banana skin at the top of the stairs.
for somebody!
Yeah, yeah.
If er.
Well I know Bon said er they'd they'd cut down on the recruiting in fact, I think they'd closed one of the hospitals in Bristol in the Frenchay where she is has actually got to take erm qualified nurses from that hospital before they take student nurses that they've trained.
so you know, I mean it's gon na be difficult for a lot of them when they go.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Does she have to.
pay for this course by the way?
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They do in erm.
Wendy, our neighbour's daughter's erm.
she's gon na have to pay for.
Oh so.
Yeah.
That's terrible is n't it?
And the, there's a crying need for the for nurses in the hospitals and wards and the, and they sort of they're cutting down you know, on the hospital programme closing wards er, not employing nurses when they need them you know, and they're trying to get.
one person to do five people's jobs!
Mm.
But that is awful is n't it?
Oh, like erm.
Like er, I was going to say a stand-by, what.
Yeah.
As they like, yeah.
That's right.
Well actually you know, Bon said this on the phone the other day.
she said I may have.
to do an agency erm.
like a fill-in.
but she does n't want to, cos I said, oh for heaven's sake do n't undermine.
the National Health Service, I said it's undermined enough!
From the private sector, but she said.
well er, you know if it comes to it I'll have to.
Yeah.
She's got the erm the qualification there.
Mm.
Mm.
That's right, yeah.
Bon has often said that we're supposed to finish at.
nine o'clock but I was there till half.
past nine!
No.
No, that's right.
Er, it's.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Still ca n't, yeah.
Cos you're at.
the bottom of the ladder!
How's your son anyway?
Not a grandmother yet?
Oh!
Oh lovely! that's my is.
Yes, fine yes.
they're all at school now.
So yes, she's coping quite well she's thinking of erm doing a course as Kelvedel College.
been down there asking about er.
you know, different courses.
Yeah.
It means getting away from the children all the time.
With adults!
Yeah!
Yeah, it's true though.
Real world.
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.
They're thin on the ground!
I've had to go out looking for one all these years!
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'd suppose we'd better go.

Mm.

Dream on!
No!
Well, good luck with the driving!
Keep at it!
Three o'clock in the morning you'll be alright!
Three am.
No, you keep at it!
It's confidence is n't it?
It's developing.
confidence.
Mind you, I've always been amazed.
that at people being able to get into a car and never driven before and be allowed out onto a highway!
I mean.
you know I would of thought the, the first thing would be.
to learn the mechanics of the car.
That's right, yes, it's nice is n't it?
Till the chauffeur er is n't there, you know!

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.
Nerves all the way!
Yeah.
The trouble is the industrial estate is full of learner drivers just like yourself!
Yeah!
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Well.

I think er.
Well, they have n't got the experience to realise what would happen if er.
That's right yeah.
Yeah.
What.

Do you pet?
I'm surprised he came to us!
When you get out the door he's sort of going the other way!
Does he?
Oh!
Well I suppose with him going out for walks from here he knows that.
you know, knows the area.

There's been a few like him, a few erm Cavaliers.
Well there's one down er, Waka drive, and erm, and once we were driving up and I thought ooh it's another and a King Charles.
Seemed to be different colour, more white than.
I mean, we've been lucky because we've.
er, that farm down the road from us er, she came round we bought the.
that sideboard off her and we were saying about the manure you know, I said, she said ooh come and.
help yourselves anytime you like!
So we've been down there a few times but I said to you did n't I?
I mean you see it advertised in the paper but no one.
will buy it!
Horse manure, I mean it's, and it's really well rotted stuff, it's good you know!
Yeah.
She's got the.
Mm.
It were them puppies puppies.

I think it was a mongrel she got it from the animal rescue.
but they had.
The one that the one that nobody.
Well.
Well,.
Yeah.
There's a lovely name for it!
Mind you, I mean they had the dog they had before, got run over.
but they had one about twelve months ago also from the animal rescue, it was a lovely little dog!
And we saw it a few times did n't we?
It's very friendly And it followed us into the lane several times and then we'd chase it back.
and the inevitable happened it it got hit and the next time we saw it it was it was galloping across the field with it's one of his front paws.
in plaster!
And it bloody saunting you know with a little down in front.
with this plaster on and er.
he was about he'd got out again.
she would n't chain it up, and it got hit and killed on the erm road just outside the Post Office was n't it?
No, you did n't you did n't suggest they.
tried to wander.
Mm yeah, the gate.
Mm.
Mm.
Do n't know do you.
Mhm mm!
Well you, were n't having any of that because er, he's on nights tonight is n't he?
So he wo n't have it.

Can you see that little bit the, no can you see how that top of that and.
Oh!
Have you got.
Have n't you got anything.
Oh!
We have n't got any pliers in the boot?
No.
I mean I suppose they've got, I've tried biting it as well, but it's.
Did you?
Mm.
He has bent that up.
that's why she ca n't get the screw right down so and I doubt whether the woman in the shop will be able to do it, needs a bloke.
No.
When he was young Oh!
When he was n't young.
Attache.
Do you want me to hold it while you shoot back in cos we ca n't.
Emily and I will.
Changed back.
Because it's.
It's forcing the screw at an angle which is why it wo n't come through.
His ears go down his head then?
They do n't charge anything for this, no.
Well, I'm saying that I wo, I do n't suppose with a woman he'd.
Well the thing is the erm the metal frames, the lenses come out eas, a lot easier, you know than a plastic.
Yeah.
Something to grip.
Oh.
I see what you mean about this.

To put it in.
Mm.
Well do n't watch me doing and then you wo n't.
frustrated!
We wat, did you see that film up, that was on a few nights ago, some time last week I think?
With er, Dennis Weaver blocking it.
It was quite good actually!
Yeah.
Yeah, well that was, yeah but if you'd seen the film you would of.

It was n't OTT really.
Well I did n't think so, but there you are!
It's the tape.

Do you want to clip that thing on your er.
clothes?
Is that a school book is n't it?
How much are they supposed to do at home?
How much?

This is got to confirm that they've, they've actually done the reading at home, yeah?
Mm.
Wonderful filing system you've got here!

Oh good heavens!
Cos you searched.

Oh I see!
Yeah.
Ye so presumably she tests them again after they've.
Yeah.
Is that one of your favourites is it?
Mm.
Another fifteen minutes and then you can take it off.
Anyway it's certainly helping with what your mummy said.
There is a oh I I take it he's got ta go for another assessment then has he for.
So.
A.
How long has he had er.

So do er does he say he does a lot of public speaking now or, or not?
He's just.
Oh I see.

Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well it's one thing to t to talk amongst your friends I suppose, and another one to be you know spontaneous when you're in front of a huge crowd of people.
And especially as you say to be humorous.
Some people are naturally like that though are n't they?
Outgoing and er.
good recollections of erm and even events that are n't necessarily really funny but can be funny you know, on the way tha, in the way that they're being told.

He was a lovely do who's Sam?
The ones at the end of the road?
The one that kept that getting out when the wall got knocked down or something?
Yeah.
Well what happened?
Oh it was old was it?
Mm.
I used to like that old dog cos he he u he, often used to come.
Oh, he never barked at me!
Actually I thinks.
I think I sort of, won a friend because I'm sure that day that we got the groceries and I bought bones for the dogs did n't I?
And they disappeared, and I'm almost certain I dropped them outside here and.
Yes.
And er if that was the case then then.
Yeah.
Probably thought it was Christmas when he found those!
Any nice pictures?
Warts!
What's that?
The the what?
The.
The Ponies pony.
Oh it's parties?
I have n't got my glasses on have I?
Yeah.
Oh I see, you've just started this one have you?
Oh I see.
So.
is it finished?
Have you done something on every page?
Mm mm.
What the devil's this?
Oh dear!
Yes.
A slimer!
Aha.
Anything else?
Oh that's i you have n't done that have you?
That's good that!
Why?
Is it.
It's a horrible one is it?
Would I be frightened?
Really?
Worse than that?
Oh!
I we, well I do n't wan na be frightened so I'd better not have a look at it!
Mm well you better warn him first!
Oh great!
I ca n't wait for that!
Erm.
No, no, they say.
marry will you erm, I do n't know!
How wo.

Well go on!..
You're interpretation.
How would you translate that?
What do we say then?
Ooh yes, that's horrible that is n't it!
Urgh!
denied oh put it away!
mm.
Put that in the horror section!
Yes, I do n't know erm.
in what context you'd use that.
No, no,.
Yes.
I was gon na say it can be quite laboured when you first read some of it.
because erm and you do have to.
Mm.
You'll have to buy, have you seen, did you see King Lear when it was on on the television?
Cos I taped that as well.
You'll have to have a look at that, that's quite good.
Laurence Olivier.
Yes, I think they make, I can.
remember going to see Hamlet with er Laurence Olivier at er while I was still at school and er we thought it.
was great!
Laurence i no, no, the film!
Mm, you know the black and white one?
And erm.
must of be, be about nineteen.
fifty one, fifty two and we thought it was great going to the pictures, you know, when you were still at school, actually you know, in, on a school day sort of thing!
And I can.
remember going in and seeing this film and, it just it did n't it was so to my mind, and you know thinking back now, my memory of it was of a sort of very dark and dreary.
film a, the language meant nothing to me at all!
I, I no I could n't understand it!
And it's only sort of, as you say, when you get older and you.
sort of.
Becomes more apparent.
Mm.
That's right.
Cos really.
a lot of it is just parrot-fashion, unless you're a very unusual person I think.
it does n't really.
sort of, have any significance until you get a bit older.
I do n't know whether it's.
sort of, life's experience make it mean more to.
to you.
And.
Mm.
The tape's on, did you know?
Is it?
Or is that just is that on all the time?
Oh, I thought it was running okay.
Mm.
Wake them up!

Mm.
Mm.
The role.
Mm and he he became.
Mm.
I mean, I can remember seeing an interview with er, John Geilgud and he'd he'd done Hamlet many years ago and er but he said he'd it was in a totally different way you know, different.
interpretation that he put on his er.
a much er more lyrical, perhaps you know, less erm intense and er.
yeah, i more ath.
lot more athletic version if you like, that, than er Laurence Olivier, than John.
Geilgud did.
And he.
No.
Well erm there's Richard the Third of course, and er.
Oh yes!
Yeah.
Well I ca n't I mean erm I think he was the kind of person he wanted to be as diverse as possible later on, I mean, perhaps he felt constrained.
by the.
fifty eight roles he'd done earlier on in his career and he wanted to sort of you know, have a go at everything.
did n't he?
Well that's, where did they get it from?
Erm.
Oh well!
Well done!
Or whatever,.
Yes, and it's funny how languages change is n't it, over the over the years?
Mm.
Yes, some of it's very recognisable.
Erm.

Yeah.
Ahh.
Mm.
But it makes you wonder, really, when you when you look at something like that how erm how well represented that was or representative of the kind of language that wa, that was used by er, ordinary people.
I mean or is it just the author's view of how.
erm.
What about Maisy?
Mm.
Is this our old book?.
I thought so.

It's updated now is n't it?
Mm.
What are you making now by the way?
How long is that going to take?
Oh!
Oh, eggshell?
Mm.
She keen to give you any.
information then?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well I suppose you can understand in a way.
Oh so.
That, that's.
Is that, oh!
Is it erm Consaquay still or is erm.
So I'm just wondering.
whether they'll be in Harden Newlow or, or Consaquay?
Mm, but I mean the area you know, it's is it.
a private house or.
That's why I say, I wonder whether it's.
Mm.
Does that come under Conasquay.
Is he?
So that would come.
under Harden then?
I'm just wondering which council it comes under that's all!
Or Allan and Deeside then, yes!
Is it all the way along Deeside then?
That's right, that's why I'm asking.
you where which.
Comes out?
Oh!
This is n't which, this is n't the one that was er.
Oh and, oh!
Oh!
Mm.
Oh dear!
Good heavens!
So.
So.
Oh ah!
Mm.
He was sort of well he was paralysed was n't he?
This is the one who's was living with another woman and his.
wife.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Relationship going.
Strange!
Great!
Mm.
Being matter of fact.
about it.
Mm.
In case she has an attack.
Mm.
Again?
Oh!
Is that the eldest one is it?
Yeah, cos they, they've all had.
Well, th oh the the three boys and her have all.
Mm.
Smallest one?
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.
Could n't say the language but he could polish.
Is he?
So he did have a problem then?
Obviously.
Words.
Yes.
Yeah, an alternative.
Mm.
Mm.
Anyway, so he's out of hospital now is he the other.
one?
The.
No, no, the la no, Jackie's little boy.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, I was gon na say it's got ta be better.
than here because it's erm so damp down here is n't it, near the river?
Yeah.
Good God, yeah, she was frozen in that house was n't she?
Like the North Pole up there.
Well what difference would that make, with, I mean.
And he's not gon na be all, going all the way down to Devon.
though is he?
Really?
Oh good heavens!
Oh!
Well what about the.
well it's more likely that she's gon na see one of the relatives than him, is n't it?
Mm.
Jackie, this is?
Jackie?
No.
And she's found somebody already?
Mm.
Mm.

Mm.
Ni, a nice natured girl.
yeah.
Easy going.
Mm.
Mm.
Well I.
Yeah.
So i well, presumably she's near her family, her parents.
Erm she must be getting some kind of.
support?
Mm.
Mm.
Are you gon na read that all that book?
No!
Oh!
You're not having peanuts!
If they could get to them before Scott.
you mean?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
They ca n't suggest anything.
Yeah.
Showing them.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah quite spontaneous.
Make them look like turtles!

Fine children!
It just shows you how they're in influenced though does n't it, by.
you know?
films and television.
and.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, we have the technology.
Ooh ooh!
Hey we got.
Ooh that's nice!
I is it the four screen one we've been watching?
Oh that's very clear then.
But it is.
That's.
Oh!
Where d'you go?
Where did go, Roberts's?
Mhm.
We said you would.
Looked in there did n't you?
Oh!
Why d'you keep telling me?
Well.
I think they've got ta.
Oh now it's on the back of the house?
and then.
Mm.
Oh, in the right spot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ye.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh is that ha, is that.
What both from the same same dish?
pay monthly for that now or.
No, but I mean do n't you have to pay for those.
Oh!
I do n't understand at all.
Is it the way.
I thought you meant the shelf was up wrong!
Oh.
Mm.
I see.
Mm.
Mm.
Could n't you have that hinge mounted slightly further forward.
on the on the.
That would hold it dead out then would n't it?
Put it.
Alright, well i well it would!
Surely it would!
I mean if you've set that there.
at the moment.
I mean you'd.
have a gap.
I mean hi.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
The only other thing.
The only other thing you could do.
Ken is have those taken off and, is this a door here?
And have those mounted on the bottom so that it's a drop down shelf.
But there again it still would n't.
Mm.
Well, no, I'm just thinking you could have it sent, but I mean it was just be on that one now would n't it?
You could do the same with both of them though would n't you?
Same thing is to take the take screws off and just try and door and see whether how much extra space you need, I mean, maybe you might be able to do it by just.
Well I'm sure, I'm sure.
you could move that forward there!
I know!
Yes!
You're not gon na see it cos there's one on the end, it's right next to the wall is n't it?
Have a gap there but I mean whereas at the moment it's like that, not to that.
to there.
But.
but it does now though does n't it?
I mean they're sticking out.
like that.
Yeah, but that's neither here nor there!
Cos the top's got a good overlap.
I mean you would n't notice that would you Ken?
I would n't be bothered about that.
Just looking for a solution to the problem that's all!
Got to think about these things you know.
No it's Sally's, it's Sally's.
No, it is, it is the same thing actually.
I, I sort of meant to bring one of those one of those forms home.
No, they're ordinary earphones.
Mm.
No those.
This lady came round from er.
Oh my Godfather!
Yeah.
I hate i, when did.
they put it, install it?
So they've obviously given you instructions on how to.
Ooh, I'm not.
surprised!
I.
I knew you had!
I thought I bet Ken will go down the road and.
Yeah.
Poor old Lucy!
I bet you were soaking!
Mm.
Mm.
Bigger picture is n't it?
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
The volume?
Oh you've got ta.

Oh!
And how does go off round to.
Put it there.
Oh Lu!
Oh Lu!

Is that for for trapping it in or tuning it in at all or a different thing?
Oh you just pick it and it'll Is that Channel Four?
How do you know which station it is?
Oh, it comes on the screen does it?
Oh Oh yeah, one, one!
But if you wanted you could?
What are the colours at the bottom?
Mm mm.
Quietly! manufacturers.
Mm.
Oh it's is n't it?
I wonder if Kelly's taping that?
Yeah.
You have n't bothered to look!
Look!
Obviously the end of the film and he's come back!
Yes it's been on.
It has been on before.
Yeah just.
V C R.
Do you have to point it at the telly?
It's a good idea I suppose.
For the ah.
For Sky.
What one of the stations that you receive?
Mm.
Is er, is it continental tv or.
I see!
So you could watch French television or German television?
Yeah.
So how many are, are there there?
Agh!
No, oh no not all.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh I see!
But the is the for that, I mean?
Lots of things.
Where do you get those from then?
Oh yeah.
For the card?
Ah!
Yeah.
He thought he had some more left.
So what are they for, for?
Are they just for a month are they the cards?
Or twelve months.
So it's quite expensive really when you think.
about it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I must say.
Mm.
Well it's not that, it's the.
the fact you get the films or recent films.
No?
Ah!

are n't.
you?

Yeah.
And, so you ca n't.
think of that i i i if you have a particular interest what are the other things that.
specialities that you can get?
Quiz games.
Mm.
Mm.

Mm.
gon na go for the commercial presentation, ha!
Could do without my it's grown to nothing since I moved!
Adverts.
Mm.
Mm!
Mm She's got one as well.
And his secretary.
Are they American Ken or so, she sounds American.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh that's.
Yeah.
Make them worse!
That's true that!
Oh!
Mm.
Just a false nail Ray!
, yeah.
Mm.
Listen well if they're long nails already they're.
Yeah, just a bit.
Yeah, that's the thing channel select..
Yeah, well I knew you said the erm the.
video was going a bit haywire!
Got to find the stations.
It's incredible channels and look!
Mm.
He's helpless!
He does n't look at the numbers!
Now let it go!
Erm.


This is what Carl he used to erm.
like go in the.

Wey!
And the arms.
Wey!
Looks fantastic.
does n't it?
Mm.
They sort of hold the sail on the wind, a bit like.
a parachute jump,.
Well they're stronger as well I think!
Weee!
Oh, oh oh!
And he's as well!
It's amazing!
It's probably Australia that.
Could be.

Ah!
Yeah, he's coming up!
He came again.
He wanted a wave.
Did he say he wanted another.
wave then?
So.
Let the wave carry him up and then sort of hurl himself off the top of it.
Mm!
Mm.
Got ta be in the right places you see.
And the right board and sails.
Oh!
Give it to Ken!
You have to have a card for that.
I wonder if you could learn the language just watching the foreign station?
Mm.
What was that?
This is the same in any language!
oh excuse me! and excuse me again!
See how you get on with this.
At least you got a decent television, have a decent video.
you can have!
I should try that Ken, I should take erm is off.
In fact, there's an adjustment on those is n't there that enables you to slide them forward is n't there?
Mm, I think so.
Anything like the ones on our wardrobe.
Looks like Michael Caine!
It is Michael Caine!
There's not a lot of it about!
Oh and er, Sigourney Weaver.
Mm.
They're dubbed yeah.
No.
Not from what I see!
The voices are totally di, in fact the Clive James showed a few clips of dubbed films I mean er John Wayne, I mean he's supposed to be so and he sounded so funny in Japanese!
He'd have been out of a job if he'd.
In his health.
B B C one.
Wimpy and Tarzan.
erm well he played Tarzan, it was n't called Tarzan it was.
called.
Greystoke.
It was Greystokes, that bought out that.
Lord of Greystokes Manor or something like that?
This is the Chichido Yin.
Mm.
I think so.
Yes I know.
Oh!
his character.
Did he from the rich and give to the poor?
Is he?
You've seen the erm preview.
Have you got your heating on full Ken?
Christ it is chilly is n't it?
Must be me!
Seemed quite hot when we came in.
She must of turns her, hers up full cos it did go cold did n't it I mean, outside?
Because we had sleet did n't we last night?
He reminds me of.
No, well yes, I suppose.
No, I was thinking of erm.
forgotten his name.
What in, Ken?
No, I do n't know him.
Oh him, ah yeah!
He had n't got any Yorkie bars by the sound of it!
No he's watching through a telescope is n't he?
You should tape this, I had to tape this, you said when.
Mm.
Yeah, it does look like Jose Perera.
The only thing interview is being on first.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
I do n't know what the situation is today, I have n't seen.
her for a few years.
Erm.
Mhm.
Well Lucy, you're well relaxed there!
I'm trying to keep our dogs out of the lounge cos they've been on the settee that many times.
and I've we've taken the the old settee down to Carrie's and moved the two seater and the armchair down this end and they flew in tonight straight up on the sofa, I said to it's gon na be tough for a week or so but they've got ta get used to staying on the floor, I'm not having them on the furniture all the time cos they just absolutely ruin it!
And they come in, I mean he skids in the hall at night I mean it's my fault I threw the rubber ring towards the kitchen down the hall he sort of skidded before he got there and there was a, and he must of had mud er, you know like like he had.
dirt in between his toes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the thing that even when it's dries out it still clings to the.
skin and.
it just comes off as dust on.
on the furniture you know!
Well they should be outside.
in a kennel!
Well we.
we like pets.
they're fairly close.
to hand but erm.
you know, I do n't wan na go to bed with them!
You know, there is a limit!
That, you've got ta say well.
you can do this but you ca n't do that and and really they're, they're like children in a way, they will sort of try it on as much as they can get away with it!
So.
Oh what they're doing?
That's why I said to you do n't feed them titbits at the table because it's so easy to.
get them.
and they sit there and he's gorping at you while you're eating you know!
Well Luc Lucy, Lucy, Luc!
You're not supposed to be on here!
We're just talking about that are n't we?
She's a funny dog!
Are n't you ay?
You're a funny old sausage!
Yes you are!
She's getting on a bit now!
How old's Lucy now, Ken?
Ken!
He's gone out in the garden now.
either that or banging his head on the wall!
Mm well this is certainly a nice television!
As telly's go!
Well ha, perhaps because of the size of the country then there maybe more stations than in France, or maybe it's just the way the satellite is pointing to pick up you know, you just happen to pick up more German stations, I do n't know!
Well there seem to be quite a few German er, German!
Quite a few American erm documentaries, almost are n't they?
Those.

Peace programmes and that, I do n't know whether they're just being broadcast I mean you wo you know, Ken, you know those American programmes that were on?
I'm just wondering whether they were.
were they being transmit, they were n't being picked up from the U S A were they?
Unless they're being, unless they transmit them from one satellite to another.
And then down to us.
Oh yes.
I just wondered.
whether the Germans would be, I mean if it's coming from a German T V station but do they broadcast American you know, English speaking programmes there in Germany.
for us to pick them up here I mean.
Because they were all in English, well American.
No.
You got a book then?
just read up on it and let us know!

Ha, why are you wagging this?
You scallywag!
Mm.
but they, I mean, oh they were n't dubbed were they?
I mean, so they could n't have been for er er Germany.

Yes you know.
and.
Mind you, bearing in mind they've still got.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Different currencies.
Er I was gon na say.
they've still got American bases there have n't they?
I know they've been pulling a lot out.
but there are still American bases.
So maybe er maybe they do transmit there.
For.
the English speaking.
You know?
Troops, forces that are there.
We have the the technology!
Build you up and we can knock you down!
What did Ken say they think all they got ta do is kick arses!
Who the.
That one was Tenerife was it?
Cos it said like like holiday maker so they get up there for a rest!
And he sent a photograph of you know, people in the boat and eating these things, you know?
I said I must watch that on Monday night, I like the wildlife programmes.
Yes, usually it's you're sort of bombarded from all sides by.
the seemingless endless problems that yo unable to to do very much about!
Oh the erm.
The rain for, er no, it was n't the rain forest, but yes.
The flooded rain forest or something was it?
I think it was.
For six months of the year it was under water!
The trees and a a all of those.
Yes, yeah, I, well I taped it did n't I?
Got it on tape then.
Mm.
Flooded rain forest, I'm sure that's what it was called.
And then, the other six months of the year when the water recedes a different sort of species comes and inhabits this area and then.
again, the cycle.
it goes on again.
Yeah.
But did n't they have did n't they say the fresh water's?
It is n't gon na be very deep!
But obviously deep enough for er.
Mm.
What's that programme that was on the other day about the erm ohhh!
Where was it?
No Ga, was it Ghana?
About the, yes, this.
exposee about the.
er well that was corruption from the government!
Well I suppose most corruption starts at the top does n't it?
It has to for it to be festering at the bottom!
But erm.
Good Lord Ken!
You've gone to town tonight seeing all this!
Er.
You know it seems it awful really that two of those places were are n't they? all these, all the forest.
fern and.
I mean if somebody did grow a tree I mean, it must be harder in that kind of area but but wi with the right will for people to plant a tree and grow it it's just as easy.
as chopping it down!
Well, you know, I mean with.
correct management they should be able to profit from the forests you know a as well replenish them.
At the end of the day it's just greed and profit to gain.
and sod tomorrow!
Well the hardwoods, yeah.
I mean they do n't grow overnight do.
But even so, I mean even that can be managed.
What is this Ken?
You do n't have to light it!
Is it?
We've tried this before when.
I ca n't remember now.
No, I do n't think so.
Ee ah trouble is you ca n't see where your cut is when you slice it like that it, oh here we go!
Paul and Cathy are going.
Yep.
When are they goi, when?
When have they booked for?
Er.
Well, I was going to say is it before Ann has the baby?
Is it going to be, it's gon na be about.
Well the baby's due after May so if they're going in May.
It's before.
Oh is that pate?
Oh that's okay.
Many thanks.
You do n't like the pate?
Well Ray likes it.
Oh these are nice!
Well what are you doing.
here then?
Oh he's even drooled over me look!
I read that story Ken.
So, oh well!
Mm.
Did n't get it from there?
Get what?
Oh what, wha.
you mean it's been made in Devon.
and called Cheshire cheese?
No, I I do, I think it's erm.
I would have thought so.
You mean they're using the recipe somewhere else?
Oh.
I do n't think so.

I do n't know, I would have thought that to call it Cheshire cheeses it must be.
Mm.
Not like that now.
Munching!
He's one of the little munchkins!
You scallywag!
You scallywag!
Yeah!
Yes you are!
Mm?
Oh yeah!
Which piece to use for which course.
Mm.
It's called the class structure.
Or system.
Well no, that was n't the case!
He wanted to create a supreme race did n't he?
he's he's and er he wanted to create a super race.
You mean the Luftwaffe?
The.
Luftwaffe.
Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of of this now does n't there in Europe?
This right wing element which is.
It's frightening really because you think well you know, I mean you said the years well that could n't happen.
again but but how long does it take before it does happen again?
I mean, do the other do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?
A grand.
scale, if you like?
Yes.
Yes.
Setting the stage for.
Although it has n't it has n't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment are n't we?
In this country?
That's yes, yes, that's true.
Erm.
and of course, when, when they when.
but the going gets tough it's it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before was n't it?
Ha!
I mean, even in France, and I mean, in fact, in fact.
in France it's more it's worse in in some respects because er it seems to be more powerful the erm the rate of you know, the feeling of.
I mean what can you, what can we do?
If, it's happening, I mean what was the Soviet Union I mean it's.
news on it it's death and destruction there is n't it?
All these minority.
groups.
We've destroyed communism.
And, I do n't.
No, no I think they've.
Well I think in some respects.
they, they wanted the downfall of communism.
but nevertheless it's better the devil you know!
Well I mean, the military will definitely.
regretting it, in in the west.
because it means a reduction in forces in in all these.
countries erm, and as you say, I mean ha you know, whether they're American generals or or the Soviet generals, whatever er they're all, they're all feeling the pinch now because er.
At the same time it, I mean the countries wo, have been crippled by the the burden of er defence if you like and we'll call it defence.
Erm, but in fact it's probably for some of the state that we're in now!
But er.
There's a price to pay for everything.
Yes yeah but I do n't know, it seems crazy to me when they've.
There's such you know sort of appalling need.

Yeah.
Only just.
So, and unfortunately erm well.
Well it is.
But.

Mm.
I mean I was reading in the paper the other day it was on about recycling.
And the different counties.
and the way they've approached it and some.
of the more progressive ones, you know they've er addressed the problem of rubbish and recycling wo erm one spokesperson for somewhere like Milton Keynes, I think it was said there's you know, there's no money to made out of ri, recycling.
that they would save erm on the erm actual tipping of rubbish.
because.
Well well this is what.
well what he meant was.
th, I mean he said they.
we are not.
we are not dealing with anything that we can not.
sell.
In.
other words they were selling glass, and they were selling metal back to whatever and manufacturers to re-use but in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and.
handling all this it's, yeah.
The cost that they were having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
But, at the same time the normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable was being reduced because.
these other items were n't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a.
fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Well they will do.
No thanks.
Mm.
Brand new stuff.
Yeah.
It's got ta be profitable.
Mm.
I think initially er.
now has got a cost more in the initial.
stages until it's sort of, set up, until everyone is sort of you know geared into doing this kind of you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the goes there.
and all the companies that are responsible for for re-using it and all the distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there you know, once that network is going then surely.
it's got ta be useful because instead of going you know from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being ever seen again it's going.
in a circle and, and surely that's got ta be cheaper once a network is set up?
And it's a, it's an ongoing thing.
Yeah.

To set it up.
Mm.
Yeah.
idea he does n't drink beer, so you can have his for.
Mm.
No the.
Yeah I said.
Well this is it it, it has to be done!
Generated the.
I mean look at Germany!
And.
Modernisation.
and they get by our country.
Mm.
But.
Mm.
And look, this used to be.
one of the best education systems in the world!
And I mean.
wo n't be here now well you could sliding right.
down the scale!
We're terrible!
you can only cut back.
and prune back so much in the name of efficiency before sooner.
or later things su suffer!
You mean, they were under water?
Oh!
Oh they had to to say who they supported and.

Yeah he's a very persuasive character.
Of a good leader.
Mm.
And he finished?
To say.
something to say.
Yeah.
I mean.
He, he looks a very persuasive kind of character does n't he erm I mean he's, he's quite sort of erm well a nice person well he.
seems to be!
But you know.
But your dukes up Neil!
Yeah, well.
I mean ha when it comes down to it, at the end of the day today we we live in er a media orientated world do n't we?
We turn on the box.
and we we see what is fed to us there, we pick up, you pick up the you know, the comic strip papers you know, yo you see headlines there, most of it is is you know Tory sort of dominated.
But er that so it depends whether you, whether you actually think about what you're seeing and what you're reading and.
what you're hearing does n't it?
Mmmm.
What do you want Lucy?
What?
No!
Yeah.
Well in a.
way.
Mm.
Yeah it's pathetic!
I I I think really they er they forget that that there's a quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not and are n't all that easy easily persuaded.
But, having said that there is but there are, but there as well!
Well they did, I.
Mm.
Well having seen a little bit erm was on the other day and I I mean I I must admit I touch shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
A lot of what's erm you know, going on now, I mean, is just gon na go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind.
I'm a loyal supporter!
And that's it!
But erm you know o, I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who have n't either do n't really care.
or they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about.
every party!
But I think the majority of them just wo n't bother anyway, to watch.
they've already made their minds up and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on on basically the choice.
Well.
think well they've had long enough now we'll we'll have a switch you know.
That's right.
And I mean there's that been that much publicity about Neil Kinnock you know, or anti Neil.
Kinnock publicity.
But er, I mean a lot of people say ooh, you know, I would n't trust him with it!
And they did n't really know anything about the blooming bloke you know!
Well he's never been.
in power before well.
Neither has blooming John Major you know!
Neither has blooming Maggie Thatcher before she came in, you know!
I mean it's.
They'll be a first time for everything!
Wack.
Wack a wack a wack!
Mm, yeah.
Mm.
In fact I think that Spitting Image dummy was more like her than she was!
Mhm.
Well it started to become like er.
Yeah.
Barbie doll.
Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll!
But.
She, i it was it was becoming like a dictatorship!
It was her at the helm.
And.
and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli, all these MP's and what not which would comprise parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time you know i it really their voices on the, on the the cabinet you know, they were, they were just destroyed!
Yeah.
Oh I know!
Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there was n't.
there?
But.
Yeah, I mean.
Well.
Yes it came to er.
A fine state of affairs did n't it.
with her even her own party giving.
her the heave-ho!
You know, I mean tha.
That's how it must be.
Well.
well this is it I think she was beginning to endanger her chances of re-election and I think.
they let her go on too long and it.
And er.
I mean it's turned into a bit of a joke now really.
has n't it?
You know, our policies are working, I mean after thirteen years.
And this recession that we've been coming out of for so many years now it's I mean it's just turned into a bit of a joke!
Well.
No, I do n't.
No I do n't.
I, I.
And that's the way power corrupts.
That's true.
Any country.
Well it is.
It is.
It is.

Aha.
And how much corruption have you discovered in the Socialist Party?
The Labour Party?
Well how much?
Yeah.
Yes.
What do you base your i, your.
Well what happens when they retire?
Well have retired from the Labour.
Party.
You must have been rich then a couple of years ago?
When you brought a second home!
No, I do n't, no!
No,.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Well no, I did n't know no you do n't.

Why not?
I would limit to two children.
Yeah.
But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever.
there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts because people would manage money differently.
some would spend it.
as soon as they get it.
some would go into hock and spend it before they get it.
some would save it, and be frugal!
Which is what the Tories want you see.
no, you're defending them!
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what would you do.
Just for money!
I think he must be.
I think you I think you've been saying.
I think if you.
as the leader of the Labour Party or the Liberal Party.
to go.
Yeah.
You ca n't expect, yes you have!
You have!
Are you, are telling are you telling me that you'd vote for somebody in rags on the television who promised you a better future?
What do you mean you did?
Who did you sa, oh!
You sod!
You did not!
And he was never in power anyway!
Well!
He was n't, Michael Foot?
Oh no he.
He was very outspoken he was a very outspoken.

Ah, yes well ah, that's got nothing to do with it!
But now it has!
Duffel coat, he got he got censored.
because he wore a duffel coat instead.
Well.
on your argument then anybody who who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top has got ta become corrupted!
That's what you're saying, no ma.
no matter who, no matter what!
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to modify your.

if you'd be elected.
You do n't get elected which is what happened.
to the Labour government.
last time!
No.
fifty percent of the population.
wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the Labour government did n't get in on that basis so they had to modify their and I mean as.
Well.
Well yeah!
The, they it's a.
Well I think it's a very being short sighted thing to do to erm.
I hope they'll rescind that.

Yes.
The closure of the mines.
I think.
Do n't you think so?
Well.
Well some of them certainly.
will definitely.
I do n't think that this.
But I.
I mean, there's enough coal in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!
And that could possibly be the only, and ah I mean it's it's a.
it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on.
I mean.
much it's it's far.
Ah but you see.
that it's.
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up.
and we ca n't them any more?
You know we, very well what'll.
happen!
When, when that market's been pruned.
down and the only.
place you can get it but the price is!
They're so short sighted!
What did he say about the.
teachers?
Yeah.
Where's that ball gone?
Bring that ball here!
Oh there we go, that was mistake number one George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?
Oh I'm not sure.
Oh dear.
Mm.
I thought it was Barry there, he looked a bit like him.
E T get down, down.
If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are.
in the U K mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping.
Well that's just what it looks like here you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night.
Mm.
well.
Mm.
Well for us I mean it's.
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast.
but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel.
Yes I did mentioned it erm.
Well you were there were n't you too?
I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I do n't know whether.
Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we had n't got into any details.
Yes, yes.
but er so I, I do n't know if he'd be interested in.
I certainly would n't coach it so I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time.
cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean I'm not particularly bothered whether.
comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he wo n't go on his.
Well this is it, he wo n't go on his own will he?
Yeah possibly but I do n't think they, do, they do n't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while have n't they, so, I do n't think, oh no, did n't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?
Did they?
That was when he was posted in Germany was n't it they went from there.
that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to.
afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage.
so, you know.
so unless erm.
tell us we.
Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there is n't it?
And it's only an hour or so away, so perhaps you should say that.
get a weekend in.
Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored.
Oh no.
you've got no chance.
No I mean, what is he, different.
in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is.
Not on par with ours is it?
Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any.
from southern Italy at all do you?
Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's.
farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them.
Not very often, not in here.
Not very often, not really.
mm, what's the other one?
Is it Rimini?
yeah.
mm there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet.
Erm.
er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled.
Sounds drastic does n't it?
Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she did n't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er.
either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still does n't lose weight.
Yeah yes, I do n't think you er you can measure I do n't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er.
Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person is n't it?
Mm she was, what, what are you doing?
Stop it.
Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to stage of operating, surely, I mean, er do n't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a.
more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the.
but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's got ta be too much eating and why do people over eat.
you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something must n't there?
I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales.
Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer?
They're not very flattering they did n't er, you were n't rated very highly I'm afraid I think er you tried to get away from the traditional type of.
Mm.
by the thousands.
Oh poetry some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad.
Oh to be honest I ca n't remember the.
Mm, but er.
what was the one about the erm oh it was about the assembling of the gun.
do you remember that?
And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts.
and er.
Mm.
Mm.
Come here.
come here scallywag.
Mm.
What, what they call it, stressing it do n't they?
Mm.
oh.
but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah I mean it's, it's so clever really is n't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that.
I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in.
beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you ca n't possibly think what's.
things that are in there, it's astronomical.
Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right oh he said that heaven.
yeah, you do huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, Where's Muffin, behind the settee?
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
She's is a, quite a.
character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you do n't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to.
single, single you out for attention she say erm, Miss Wax who likes to think of herself now principally as a writer, the comic talents of this calendar who needs laxative.
Mm, mm, yes.
Well if I take him you can do the veg if you like get down.
Well I will but I doubt this, oh god I've got heap of things to do.
You're going are you?
What's that?
Well, I think all I need is bread really is n't it?
So I.
I'll keep an eye, spend your money.
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do.
Yes I know.
Abnormal.
I noticed the little girl with her, yes.
Huh.
Who you do n't know from Adam.
Off the lead like?
Away from it or.
Spaniel, yeah.
Stitches.
Mm.
keep going.
Yeah.
Mm.
No.
Try?
Robert.
Mm.
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well were n't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and wo n't be able to turn it over.
Nobody's interested no, it's a shame.
Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the.
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall, yes.
but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be.
Is it?
Oh oh they've just locked.
locked it up because er.
So did she say she could get some?
Or.
Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose.
but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so.
Mm.
oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call.
Which pub?
at the college?
well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there?
You multiple that by.
however many there are.
Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ai n't he?
So er.
mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that.
or are you.
just taken it in out of the book?
Oh.
Rubbish.
Mm.
that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?
And that, and this, you kept getting this er.
oil through.
Oh.
Mm.
So just use wax to build up the polish.
Mm.
Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?
Well, cos with him being on night, I do n't suppose he got up till about.
one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the.
I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he did n't want to bother, but I thought afterwards that'll be each one of those holes, he.
yes.
well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand.
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that.
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time is n't it?
And water.
Yes.
well.
Yeah.
I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work is n't it?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee.
if he's on there just shout at him will you because.
Yeah.
Personally I would of.
Well of course that's what vitamin C is is n't it?
Oh.
oh my god, well that's the stripper then really is n't it?
Well you only put.
Oh.
Mm, so you only want a small amount then really do n't you?
Mm.
Which chemist did you go to?
Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see.
get in your basket this minute.
go on, go on.
Yeah, that's right, yes, yeah.
and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose.
Mm.
already, ready mix.
Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form are n't they?
You know you do n't get that many liquids it's usually for children is n't it?
The erm you get.
Yeah.
I bet they do n't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter do n't they?
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty so.
so well where you gon na go for that?
Where else can you try?
At the college do you mean?
Mm.
Well why do n't you try Mr Bentley I mean.
Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than.
to get it, I mean he's very obliging.
He lives over the shop still does n't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character is n't he?
But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think.
a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out.
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you.
You've got no chance of that.
Yes oh god Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow go on I want to put those lupins in.
today, somewhere never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash.
I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it.
You want to try it do n't you if you're going to have it?
Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?
Or.
Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?
Ca n't turn it out.
Yes, but you wo n't get the same connections will you?
Use your.
I'm looking for something somewhere Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I do n't know oh Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you it sounds pretty audible anyway, I do n't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a.
No.
Erm.
Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood.
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the.
Oh I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for.
Mm, and it.
Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?
Eleven or twelve was n't he?
Near that.
mm.
Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you.
yes, yes.
Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him?
Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger are n't you?
Erm.
and the door, the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these.
you know.
Mm.
there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it,.
they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and.
Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that.
yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them.
I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself I think that's a brilliant idea that.
it's a diamond, it's a diamond pattern is n't it for.
as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?
Cooked?
oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm.
what do you.
erm.
well, well only temporarily, I only want this.
it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to.
right erm, just erm.
oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?
Just down the bottom.
Right what you're going to have to do is erm.
Yeah, yeah.
I do n't know, it do n't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there is n't it?
Er, well, put it on the floor.
Go in your basket go on.
So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?
Mm.
oh these are about two inch are they or some, did n't say.
it would n't split in half went for it and.
Twelve inches across are they?
That way.
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Would n't Sue do them?
has n't she?
I bet she had, I bet she had er.
no I know she's got a.
I thought she had a band saw no.
I was gon na say you wobbling all over the place are n't you?
And what about Duckman Peters would n't they do it for you?
huge, to that their costs mm.
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw.
Yeah, god worse than.
erm.
mm, how many have you got to now cut?
and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you could n't get it done there?
What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you.
Why?
To reverse them.
Well I do n't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah without a guard on it.
mm, mm.
No I can understand that I suppose.
Something to grip it, mm.
what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er.
do n't think you'd be very happy you know.
Damaging them, saw, mm.
right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?
What are you gon na do?
It's impossible to do by hand.
with a good saw.
and about ten irish navvies.
mm.
Oh hello.
No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he.
sent me one.
Yes.
I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the.
wax.
Oh.
Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them.
Bury is n't it?
Bury the one?
the address I had.
Bury,, Bury.
Hello you Lucy-woosy, hello there Lucy-woosy, yeah, ooh, you're a lovely girl you oop.
Right so all you need is a good saw and a ha, ten Irish navvies.
I said.
He, he had a lot of machinery actually years ago he, before he moved here he sold.
He sold er most of it.
because he did n't have the room for it here.
he had a.
Yeah, but I mean he's done all his windows has n't he, he's adapted all his windows from that er.
from that frame he's bought, so he's done quite well really.
ah?
oh one of those pits yeah.
Yes, I'm good at that.
Sounds a bit.
Get another volunteer.
Have you got your grandchildren Easter eggs yet chaps?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well they could, they're moving up here are n't they.
time, so.
Oh, well I said.
when we were at Carrie's at the weekend I said you must tell me all the birthdays again, because I ca n't find them.
What's coming up that month.
Good idea actually.
Well I'm, I'm the same, I was talking to Rob the other day and er, I forget how I mentioned it, but I said something about, oh I think it's because I was saying why do n't you come up like this week because he's off this week, and er, he was making some excuse or other, oh I've got three weeks off in the summer, oh I'd sooner come up when I've got this longest spell off, you know, and I want to get this chimney done and blah, blah.
so I said something about last week, you see, and I could of, it was my birthday last week and, but er, and I carried on, he said oh go, oh I'm sorry mum, I'm sorry about that and I said do n't matter, does n't matter, well I thought, right I'll let him know.
Yeah, he's got, he's got all the birthdays on his calendar.
I mean, he does sort of ask about the er.
he's got them all written down.
I did, I always remembered my mum's cos it's St Patrick's day.
Who did?
I've no idea.
No Ken did n't know your mother's birthday Raymond.
What are you like?
Oh dear.
no.
Rob's is August, yeah.
Sixth of August is Robin, it's only a week after yours, it should be easy to remember.
Well it, I ca n't, I'm always getting mixed up you know, whether it's the twenty ninth or the thirty.
You always get a card.
No chance of doing that.
Yeah.
All I've got.
The week before yeah.
Small but an expensive present please.
What do you have Bertie eh?
Yours a.
yes, yes, go on.
Why?
Oh shut up.
Why, have you had an upset tummy?
Oh.
You're like a blooming dog, one meal a day.
Did you.
So have you still got it have you?
One last fatal tap.
Mm.
What.
to fill it up to fill.
You can buy all kinds of filler now it should do anything, indoors or outdoors.
ca n't you?
I know down at Evans I've noticed quite a few things in there, there are different.
you know for, for different jobs.
For you, it's.
easy for you who to say.
So it's been in the garage for years?
You should ruddy well call them back to get it they caused the damage or failing that, claim on the insurance mind you they'd probably say well you must get in touch with the company that did the job.
I mean if somebody.
puts an aerial on your roof and they knock a hole in your roof then presumably they're liable for the damage.
having said that it's getting them, getting them back is n't it to do it what was I gon na say before I started saying something did you.
oh did you see that film?
That was it, did you see that film Blocking It with erm Dennis Weaver.
Weaver.
about the chap that could n't read.
No we, he played McCloud.
Yeah.
Do you want to borrow, well it's on two tapes, well I've still got it on the tapes if you want it, it's quite a good quite a good film.
it's quite a good film.
Yeah, so I mean you'll have to find a spot on the film where it.
this is a film.
Yes, yes.
the erm Dances With Wolves.
erm.
I think that's the first part and I think it's ready to go on there, erm.
yes.
and the other, the rest of it is on the end of that, but I've wound it almost back to the beginning, that's Fantasia at the beginning of the tape.
which is about two hours long so.
so you'll have to fast forward it and suffer the last hour.
Fantasia?
You scalpel.
ai n't you?
Eh, mm.
Yes they have seen it, yeah, I said to Carrie have you watched it.
er well I did n't go into details.
but er.
I think er she said some of it was a bit you know slow and dragging for them.
I mean er there was some of the music which was n't our.
yeah, and.
very nice.
but er the sorcerer is.
It was popular in the cinema's was n't it?
Well that's why, that's why I said well we would.
keep it on tape because.

promoting a film perhaps, I do n't think she's in a.
Mm, I know it, she was with her husband because erm whoever it was.
who interviewed her.
I ca n't remember who it was now, but they said have you been, have you seen this, have you done that, which she said no she has n't, I think she'd only just arrived some, some time last week did n't she?
But er, mm.
I would n't of thought she.
The more austere types.
Yes that's her role in.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well she's a bit like that in Driving Miss Daisy I think is n't she?
Mm, well I'm only going by cuts I've seen, but same type of role I suppose.
So what have you decided to do about these damn boards?
Mm, see how many.
One of the hand held ones.
Oh, cheap, oh I thought it would of been about fifty pounds.
Oh.
Oh I mean.
What if the same situation would apply with iron nails presumably then.
Mm hand made nails mm, you'll have to ask him about it, it might be an investment and begin a usually.
So does he take his to a timber yard to be split?
Well why does he use it then, why does he need a metal detect?
Mm.
Yes, mm.
Yeah.
It's a three quarters.
Two boards.
And keeping it straight, you'd have to have a jig or something to keep it in.
Mm.
the Channel Tunnel.
We'd have two tunnels.
Get inside you're going.
See the saw marks, mm.

That's gon na be over a pound.
Yes that'll do fine thanks, have you got any bones or bits for the dogs please?
That's lovely, thanks very much.

mm.
Oh forgive me love I did n't even look to see what it was.
Well trained.
Oh.

Yeah.
Can you come away from it?
No I did n't.
I knew it.
I was just saying get a move on cos we've got to go to Paul's.
I have n't yet no, but I think he's outside mixing cement, we said we'd go and give him a hand to put his posts in.
so, I come in quickly hoping that you've done.
Ooh, who's been painting?
oh this look's nice does n't it?
I'm just trying to remember.
that's right.
Yes.

He's lucky, he says what have you done now?
He says I'm gon na fall over the blooming stuff if you keep mov it's nice so is n't it?
So, yours was like ours was really, that, you went straight through there into the kitchen did n't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's in its.
It's much better.
They say and in a hall which.
Yes, yes.
That's right yeah.
Yes, yeah, well we do I mean well we had to take our chimney down.
oh so you.
And then it gets the sun at the back, you know.
What have you got on.
oh that's better.
Oh I see yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah.
with got the pipe, that's right, yeah.
I wonder if that's why.
Yeah.
you still get the condensation.
and the floor at the back is er.
Mind you do n't forget it depends how many times you flush as soon as you put.
cold water rushes in again.
once the room, once the water's got to the temperature of the room if you're not using the loo.
that's, that's nice though is n't it?
Yeah.
yeah, yeah.
that's a good idea.
Well in the other house we had, we had like an airing cupboard here and we took that out and had a shower where the airing cupboard was and we would of had.
Yes, yeah.
it's better to have this hall accessed though is n't it?
To all the rooms.
I mean ours is only very, very narrow but er.
but at least you can get.
cos somebody's in the lounge and you want to take, somebody comes to the kitchen you can.
That's right blows this way does n't it?
Mm.
yes that's right.
It's much better that though is n't it?
It's a much better idea, I mean ours.
the.
Well if we've been on a drive like you are.
opposite.
I, I think we would have.
because you feel as though you.
you're exposed up to there always do n't you?
Yeah, yeah, I know that's it.
that's all you need though is n't it?
Oh gosh, I mean, well you can, you can stand up and use the.
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
cos there's the two walls, yeah.
did you do a brick wall here or.
That's stud wall, yeah ours is a stud wall at the bottom.
Oh I.
just.
you've got a window there.
Yes that's a good idea.
Yeah good idea that Norm yes, yeah.
Yes, oh he's.
inventor and all.
Well that's right, I mean you get it to.
Oh yes, do you ever look in that chap down opposite the er, the Downs, well it'll be the Downs.

Keep the penny safe.
Yeah.
Mm.
So they.
Yeah.
all the brick, yeah, well er, it was er mostly brick yard round then was n't it?
That's right, yeah.
yes, in fact when we were moving up here from er, from Warwickshire, they er.
they, they er, the building society which was the insurance company was n't it that we had the mortgage through?
And they, they asked us about mines in the area and we said mines.
did n't know there'd be mining up here, you know.
and er, anyway we checked with the er solicitor.
and he said oh you know about that, all was in.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Where they'd tipped the waste was it?
Mm.
Ah, yeah.
Yes.
Mm and there's still.
there's still one down at the plantation, you know er.
Yes.
which, well it was.
have n't been there for many years.
The what?
And the Scotsman said that.
Oh dear well you've certainly made a nice job of it here anyway.
You, I think you've got over the erm, the dusty bit of it now.
You're sort of getting it a bit more.
liveable.
Yeah.
once, well you know, once you're knocking walls out, it's, it's mucky.
all over the house, you ca n't keep it.
in one spot.
On a tilt.
Oh dear.
Oh ours was like that, you know, I used to feel quite a shame.
because for eighteen months I mean there was this sledgehammer and all you could hear was boom, boom.
and he was knocking walls out.
Do n't be horrible you.
I often thought what the neighbours that and, you know, and Mrs who used to lived here then.
I mean, I bet she.
was chomping away trying to listen to it.
I told you did n't I.
Oh dear.
I was apologising for the noise was n't I?
Oh god, yeah.
yes, she was.
yeah well I'm.
I said you have n't polished that grot iron fence out there have you?
you wo n't be able to tell the difference.
A method in your madness is n't it?
Yeah, it seemed to be very wet over this side.
Well listen, get, go, go what's the name of that place?
We bought some after we had laid out for most of ours.
we find, we found out about that place and it was, it was a third cheaper you know.
Selling to us.

To the eleventh of June they've got.
Mm.

That's right yes.
I read that, so, did she.
She became anorexic then did she?
Well it said she's a nice, in the paper last.
an evening leading review, it said er she is now a ni, a trimmed erm ten stone, oh a size twelve.
Good heav, well it said they only.
do this operation if, if erm there.
are health reasons for it as well as being grossly overweight.
Oh.
Yeah, well this is it, she's only short.
yeah.

Oh dear.
Mm.
Mm.
So and she was.
Personality change.
Well is this one who and he said she ditch, she ditched her husband and got she's got a new man or something.
This was, this is what it said last night, one of them that lost the weight said, she said it must of been her, yeah.
said she was with a new husband.
Oh I do n't, I did n't see it you see, I knew it, it was only what I read.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh.
Mm.
Yeah.
How old was she?
Looked like a different person I suppose.
Mm.
Mm.
You cheeky devil.
I'm only ten and a half stone.
I tell you what, do you ever remember Olive's, oh I do n't think you ever saw her, Olive's niece she used to work at.
She was enormous, what the devil was her name?
Her mum was Ann, that was Olive's sister Ann and what was, what was the do at the.
Er yeah.
remember big.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, yeah, er, oh no I think you're thinking of a different Olive.
No, Olive that used to work when I worked for Laura Ashley's.
erm she was hefty though and her sister Ann used to be enormous years ago this is, and erm she went on a, a diet, I do n't know what, how, how she lost the weight but she did and I, I had n't seen her for some years and I remember her coming to the factory this day, and she came in and she, she used to do er her flower shop, she used to do flower arrangements and the girls at work would order them you know?
And she came in this day with these flowers and spoke to me and I did n't know who she was.
I felt so ashamed because I did n't recognise her and she was sort of talking away to me as though, you know, and I thought oh very friendly person, you know?
And I did n't realise it was her.
Well, she'd lost that much weight, now she's very conscious from then on, you know, she's sort of kept her weight down, but her daughter also had a job at our place and she was gross, I mean, Olive and Ann had both been huge women, but, but this daughter, and she was only about five feet tall and er, I do n't know what her weight was but it was one of those.
sort of.
one of those size people you'll turn your head.
she coul, I mean she just looked like a Michelin man, as though somebody pumped her up with a.
yeah it was, oh it was terrible and I thought what a strain that must be on her heart, you know, carrying all that weight.
well.
well I mean the heart's the most obvious organ, but I mean it must put a strain on everything else.
So is it tomorrow night Brownies?
The weigh in.
All the Brownies ' mums are gon na be wasting away.
All the heads crowding round to see.
I bet there were n't.
Oh, so she was still overweight then?

You know and.
and I oh my god I should n't.
of said that you know, he's paid a fortune to have this freebie.
No, no.
He has got curly hair.
it's just the way they cut it and it's sort of all these little curls.
at, at the front, yeah.
I expected to see the laurel leaf in the back you know.
Whether you wanted it or not.
everybody had the same.
Mm.
Mm.
oh.
Funny you get used to.
Is she alright now without them or does she have to wear them part of the time?
Mm.
All the time.

Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
I mean it's, it's the sort of thing we have.
Mm.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean the thing is they've got to.
Yeah.
I mean they've got to understand that when the teacher tells them to do something that.
that's what they're supposed to do, I mean and if they do break the rules they've, they've got to accept the consequences and it's as simple as that.
Mrs.
I bet they dawdle to go to Mrs.
Yeah, I mean they're only little are n't they?
But er.
I mean it's all part really, of, of learning respect for the teachers and.
and adults is n't it?
You know if they think they can do just as they like at that age, well I mean er the, the.
some of them er when they're fifteen or sixteen.
they're uncontrollable.
He's got that sort of, he's got that sonar device, tells you what's coming.
I could never connect when I was trying to wallop Paul and Rob.
We used to break all kind of speed limits getting out of the door.
Yes, yes.
Cruel mother.
beating us up.
it's so frustrating is n't it when you're in the middle of a crowded shop you know.
and they look at you as you just said as, you know, you're powerless, you ca n't do anything now.
Oh I know it's terrible, it's terrible now.
Child watch.
No.
Yeah.
Go away you where's the biscuits?
mm.
No I mean, they're not, they're, they're quite well behaved really, but that's, that's only the way you you teach them to.
Yeah maybe they're too.
when they're at home.
Used to drag them in that's why.
you do n't behave when we go out.
When they mean yes.
I used to.
Mm.
Mm.
Well this is it, they want to run up and down when they're little, I mean, they got ta expand that energy.
Yes, more space, more rooms to run in.
Yeah, mm.
So I take it Laura's got her sinus problem sorted out did she?
It grabs you.
That one's that been.
The one at the bottom, that's unbelievable that.
Is this a bottom tooth now she's?
Mm.
Oh good lord.
Mm.
You could al you could always take her to the dent, is the other tooth in front of it or behind it?
Behind.
They do n't like to do it what even in under those, I mean the other tooth's nearly the same size, this is what happened with that tooth of mine there, I was.
it, the other one would n't come out and eventually the to, this tooth that's here now.
was the same length as the one in front so.
its, honestly it was and eventually of course it did come out and there's always been a gap because the one behind.
could n't straighten out.
I always thought it was only Canada that do it with.
Grommets?
Who had.
Yes it is a grommet well.
Oh god.
and this is an operation to actually to have this inserted?
Mm.
to drain it.
God.
Oh I've never heard of that it must be.
Sinuses.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well the adenoids must be, I mean must, I always think of Melvyn Bragg you know.
he sounds very adenoidal.
but er.
Retarded.
Because he could n't hear properly.
Mm.
Mm.
So, well they're all at school today anyway.
She's wound up.
Mm what time do you, do they go to bed?
I know they read yeah.
I mean if, if they are in bed, I mean if they are there they are resting to some extent, even if they're sort of awake but.
Yeah, she's a late bird, but er.
does she, you, you said she was having vitamins for a while did n't you?
Mm having a good variety.
well.
Mm.
it's unusual that for children really cos they do n't usually go for salad.
Bang goes the diet.
What were they cheese and onion?
Mm.
Ah egg.
A beaten egg is n't it?
mm or a quiche.
Mm.
This is like true confessions this.
All the things that you should n't have.
Yeah.
He said I do a lot.
and then keep them and perhaps have a bit of a fry up.
Ah.
Well, well I mean we called in the other day.
in the afternoon and er.
he had a biscuit with a cup of tea and he said that's the first thing I've had to eat.
today and I said well why?
You know, he said oh I, I usually only have one meal a day.
Well that's right.
I do n't.
think he used to bother.
Oh er, I do n't think he does, he likes.
and, he erm raw vegetables.
he'll eat raw carrot and things like that but otherwise the only vegetables he'll eat are potatoes he eats.
It's a bit boring is n't it?
Not very often.
Yes if we catch him he eats a couple of carrots in his hand.
I think, I think they're quite big meat eaters really and erm.
Oh yes that's right, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Olive is olive oil.
pure olive oil.
Has it?
I must have a look on my bottle I've.
I did n't study the label.
I just I just saw it was pure virgin olive oil and I thought oh that'll do.
That's what the can says.
Mm, but unless it's added additives.
Oh you have n't got your glasses on.
No.
Mm, that's probably why though.
if you get the virginal I do n't think.
Oh.
Mm.
You've got to be a blooming chemist now to de, de, decipher all these labels.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Do they?
Mm.
I do n't cook in, in I cook with oil, if I use oil.
but I very rarely fry any thing anyway.
When I go shopping I.
I want it simplified, I want it in big letters this is good for you, this is not so good, or this is bad.
or this is very bad.
you know and then it's up to you but.
Oh very ambiguity.
A mixture of it.
Mm.
A streak of white yeah where the dough, streak of white dough had n't been mixed in properly.
Mm, a marble, a marble loaf, there you are.
Their granary bread is beautiful.
It's a lovely taste I mean I do n't.
no it does n't look particularly dark.
but it does, oh it's great.
Malted loaf.
They, well there's no taste to it, I mean it's what you put on white bread.
It's just as nutritious though, is n't it?
I mean they have to by law, when it's, I mean.
Yeah that's right, I mean it's so refined.
they took all the goodness out of it and then by law they have to put it back again do n't they, to er.
Have n't had Cocoapops for ages.
Oh there's so many of them, so many things I do n't know.
Yes his car brakes, listen erm, this erm, this sponsor thing does it say.

So how often are you going to be going to the dance now that the weather's better you mean.
Displacement, eureka, I have it.
Ah.
quickly.
Everybody hurried then out of the way I suppose.
There's a.
can do as well.
oh is that what it is?
No.
funny thing there was a letter in the paper though er in the Legal last night and it was some woman who'd written to say that erm, this little girl had collected two, over two hundred signatures for erm the er anti hunting.
lobby you know, erm and presented or sent them.
to Barry along with other, numerous other people.
and obviously you and I and a few others, but erm.
he said it's a pity that erm Barry did n't see fit to vote for it, so.
Well no, if, if that letter's to be believed he must know.
must of well he must of done.
see, there are a lot of farms up where Barry lives.
Well I do n't mean that I'm not gon na vote for them but I am disappointed.
What are you gon na do?
No you.
no, you, must vote really, must vote, vote for the Labour Party.
You try and er.
work on them, when they're in power.
You I mean you, you criticize him but I mean I know a few people who, who he.
has helped.
I mean they ca n't, they ca n't possibly do everything for everybody at the right time I mean.
He's not Jesus Christ is he after all's said and done, you know.
you ca n't work miracles get out of it, get on with that car.
Bye then.
Study the dictionary, yeah.
Yeah.
get all.
No she does n't know anything yet.
Yeah she's just gon na, she's just got to pass.
you know I mean.
I, I mean I dare say.
no she only works at nights and she was asking about nights for Carrie you see, cos I.
can baby sit.
for a couple of nights, when she was on, she asked me if I thought Ken would baby sit a couple of nights, if he could you know perhaps ask different people to baby sit you see, so I said well I did n't like the idea of that anyway.
so I said well, I said I thought of baby sitting you know if you want.
I mean she does n't she did n't know how many nights it would be.
Well no evenings you see.
No.
like six till ten something like that you see.

in the evening you see, anyway she said the evening shifts are all full.
but they have got Saturdays and Sundays, or she thinks there's Saturday and Sunday, she's gon na ask about it.
so it's time and a half as well or something she said on Saturdays.
oh I do n't know.
I mean I should imagine there are so many people now looking for jobs.
and if they can get somebody who has n't got any ties then they do that.
Yeah.
Well they're trying, I mean they do n't, they do n't owe anybody anything, they do n't have to pay them holiday pay.

He was taking this bloody little.

and yeah, well just the first names, so that they.
can identify.
who is saying what.
They, he.
I did n't say anything.
But erm he's, he's pressed the play button instead of the record button!
And er so they've.
You know there's twenty minutes you know and there's half an hour of of tape when he thought he was taping when it was just running.

And they.
That's right.
Yes.
That's right, and she did n't ta erm we did n't do this erm.

But whereas agency could verify these.
Erm.

Cos I for what they want.
You know?
And they will go by what you want from it for the o, over the next few years you know?
But erm so er I mean, but I I often wondered whether she got commission from that or, or not if they're supposed.
to be independent?
Presumably they do n't.
And she was very nice!
And er er, talk about being nice, but she really But we've in.
knew.
you know, everything.
that.
their best one.
you know, and it was there at their fingertips.
Very good!
Very efficient!
No, not that.
No, I'm not!
You are!
He had a cup of tea at Carrie's today just you know, checking the tape and making sure that people's names are on it in the correct order and what did you do?
Would n't make any difference anyway Brian!
You'd only get snoring on it!
I might do that actually, yes.
That's because of the snoring an.
Good!
Well you know what it's like now to be woken up in the night!
It's terrible!
You do n't know who it was?
Mm.
Mm.
You went first!
Well that's not neighbours is it?
What time was it, two o'clock?
Mm.
Wait a minute!
Now there was something in the paper tonight about the ruckus you said I'll have to ask Brian about that.
What what night.
was that?
Was that Saturday?
That's right!
And you said about that.
You did.
It was oh was it las.
Last night?
Are you sure?
Oh!
Well perhaps it was n't.
Well I.
it's not an it's not instant reporting!
Like I said they we erm th th did n't say whether they were connected with pub.
There's some suggestion that they were n't.
Well the men from mechanics were n't they?
I have n't, I did n't read it actually you sa what you told me.
But you did n't hear anything last night?
Well, so, no it was n't Saturday night then.
So what happened when you got out?
Mm.
Were they drunk?
Just noisy.
By the time they respond you mean!
Oh no.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes why not?
Mm.
You have to be able to.
the police ca n't stop you.
As long as you're going somewhere.
That's right!
At midnight.
Mm.
Mm.
Trouble is when it's so deadly quiet in the middle of the night as it is.
here.
okay, so it does disturb you.
Mm.
Mm.
Funnel the sound.
Yeah.
Scrape them out.
Oh, so it's.
come a come apart has it?
Mm.
Well it's alright as your er, okay with heights and I mean.
no, I'm no good one.
Oh yeah, it's at angle yeah!
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, how eventful week!
No, no.
Only when you say, what did we do?
Or is, what happened.
next?
Well that was exciting!
Just the two of you?

We went to.
Probably did.
We went on the top road.
Abugally.
Oh no.
We went.
to Abugally It's near the Town Hall, it's a the market was there so.
Ah but what was the weather like?
On Sunday.
Go in erm, Abugally market we had n't got any we got there, we did n't have a pound coin for the what's a name?
Machine.
And Ray went to this little cubby hole where these two fellers were one of them looked like a policeman did n't he?
Said, have you got any change for the machine?
Said, oh no mate!
So, Ray said well what are you gon na do?
And they sort of said, well we'll have you!
You know have you arrested sort of thing!
We should of just got in the car and left there and then, parked.
round the corner!
A pound! well we were only.
there for five minutes!
Somebody's chairs.
Oh foam!
Kinsale Hall.
To get well he en, insisted on driving all the way up the drive, I said if it were on there would be a.
sign at the gate!
Mm.
What time was that when you.
Oh no, we were in the mi well late morning.
Half eleven.
Unintentionally left it on while.
but.
we were heading for Llandudno junction.
Like you say, I'm sure it's only us that does.
Oh it's here!
Go, go this way!
And I checked we were on the causeway.
Mm.
No.

Well I do, I mean I did n't know it anyway.
Mm.
estuary.
And this great big long board.
Brawith House pointing and the roof's only about three feet long!
Mm.
Well, no.
no!
It's er.
It it's sort of we almost like an end of terrace, if you like and the roads.
But it's only the width of the front door and a window.
it's it is it's a, it's the.
width of a door.
That's all it is!
Was n't.
much there was.
There were only a few inches.
either side of the door were n't there?
Well I did n't think it was that wide.
It's ridiculous!
Normal height.
As I say it was tapped on to a row.
So there they had to be.
Well.
I suppose it was deep.
Probably went back a few.
feet you know, ha.
just a a novelty.
Well we were gon na have a look at the antique places but none of them were open.
Oh, Ken was asking us about that.
Oh I must tell him then!
Where was it?
Wait a minute, I'm lost!
Coming up say.
that again.
Oh yeah.
Mhm.
Yes.
Yeah.
No, I meant for Ken he's.
Ken asked us for.
a good place for Sunday Lunch.
Mm.
So you're supposed to have what.
Mhm.
and the deserts.
no?
Well.
Well we we're going round Conways we sa, we'd gone into a pub for erm we had sort of granary baps did n't we?
And salad.
And we sort of walked round the town and back to where we'd parked the car and there were there were places you know, pubs and cafes which are.
Well we were n't anyway there was very few pe, I mean at this time of the year I suppose but there was one place and it said Sunday lunch, there was a sort of black board outside, Sunday lunch erm four pound was it four fifty it was four fifty was n't it?
And it was a starter, it was soup for a starter, and it was.
roast beef or pork.
and a choice of two deserts, which was treacle pudding or some, whatever else it was!
Cos I did look i, I said to Ray, good God!
And we'd paid two ninety five.
for our baps and a bit a salad, you know!
And I said really, it's cheaper to have er a full you know, I mean you would n't want an evening meal obviously.
if you had that cos if.
You got bulk pra quantity rather than quality in there!
Oh!
Mm.
Microwave.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Which is near impossible!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
That's very good though is n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
And you were home.
Mm.
And a break from the journey.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh!
Because they wo n't reserve a table I suppose.
will they, no?
Mm.
Mm.
Nice setting then.
Mm.
Well it's funny because erm, when we saw Ken the other day he was saying that erm his niece rang him up and erm she's er she's gon na be in Crewe this weekend for a friend's wedding and, I think she must be coming up with some, some other girl as well, because the two of them, he said, I'm taking two young ladies out on Sunday for lunch where's a good place for a Sunday lunch you see?
So we were sort of wondering, you know, where.
to recommend so, I mean, I said well I do n't know about that you know, the Toby Inn, I mean I know it's a.
all a chain are n't they?
But er in North of Hull, cos he said I do n't wan na go too far.
erm and somewhere sort of reasonable.
I mean ee it's awkward for him now because I mean he's he's not a dab hand like some men, like they, he likes messing about with menus and you know.
In the kitchen he.
I mean he only likes a very simple diet himself, so he does n't.
experiment with food at all.
So he could n't do anything oh, ye well yeah!
Yeah, but.
yes he'd just have to I mean, peas and potatoes that'll be the limit!
In the vegetables.
Well I said to him,.
Yeah.
Well, no darling I was gon na say Ken he sort of suggested.
he said, I I'm wondering whether to do a meal myself at home.
Erm well I said it's a bit awkward really.
because I mean.
Yeah it is.
You know sometimes.
especially today!
They're perhaps vegetarian or something.
unless you know.
he might have done a roast dinner and that they.
you know, they do n't want meat!
And you're stuck then.
I said, and i, if you do take them out it's.
you can have a choice.
of course.
So.
That's right yeah.
Yes, well this is it.
If you're eat.
well, that's it, it's good value is n't it really?
Oh I'll have to tell him about that.
So it's the Miller's.
kitchen?
Ye, I should.
think so, yeah.
You've got ta.
turn right at the Two Mills.
Sunday, is n't it?
They're coming in.
the wedding's on Saturday and they're coming up.
On Sunday.
That's what he said where's a good place for Sunday lunch you see?
So they'll.
be there in the morning and.
What for?
Well I probably will see him!
I'm not gon na ring him tomorrow, it's Wednesday!
You're gon na get.
a smack round the back the of head in a minute!
Mm.

No.
I do n't mind now and again.
Mm.
It just tastes of Indian rubber!
I'd sooner not have any beef at all!
I dunno it's!
And we had some of.
Pat's son invited us round for dinner, I never thought so say you know!
Do n't do anything.
particular for us.
wo n't do chicken or fish.
But erm she did this roast lamb.
and ahhh The pair of us were.
rolling around!
And I said, gives him indigestion dunnit?
Just could n't eat it, I sa it was all.
fatty!
You know, it took ages to digest!
And I thought it was just me, but Ray was the.
Well that's it and i i i.
It's an easily digestible.
Erm food.
All that cholesterol Brian!
What, black pudding?
For the iron?
Lourdes!
Dunno, something you read.
in the paper yesterday.
Mm, I've forgotten now.
I dunno, I did n't read it!
Vitamin B one.
Very good for you!
Good for the liver.
No!
No!
Yeah.
You might as well just buy.
iron and multi-vitamin or jus just iron tablets!
Well.
I know they do say if you eat a balanced diet you should n't need supplements.
But I think when you get a certain age.
cos you do need supplements.
er.
Yeah.
So instead of swallowing vitamin C tablets just.
use a main juice all ti.
or eat more oranges.

Mm.
the.
I bought some last weekend.

Oh!
Good!
I bought it in a jar and it was it was funny at the poppy actually and they said.
He was nosing along the shelves and I said oh!
What about.
Horlicks?
He said I have n't those for years!
Well.
firstly.
Mind you, I mean there's no point they'll be looking up the first word of each of these.
You think so?
As one word you mean?
Well it's hyphenated.
What is it?
What have you got Brian?
Oh it wo n't be in there!
What?
Oh!
Mm.
Mm.
He's got an itch did he say?
Mm.
Mm.
Ooh! glass off!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Could be anywhere.
Mm.
A telescopic crutch.
I, I do n't want another.
drink Brian.
Oh!
It looks like the same i, is it the same as our one?
The Pocket Oxford?
The one we bought.
Saddle cheek, yes.
It's very ela.
it's too elaborate for a hall porter's chairs is n't.
it?

It's yeah definitely too fancy for that.
Well maybe it's a Masonic throne then!
Have you?
You can tell me, you're in the Masons.
Did he?
No?
saddle horse saddle.
saddle bags.
I mean, ye, because it's.
because it's leather erm.
bound, leather covered.
it may.
Yes.
It makes you think of saddle does n't it?
But erm.
Anyway, dad says he's got it.
Do n't speak to anybody.
Peas in a pod.
Well what's that saddle?
Did you see anything under the saddle?
Have you looked?
Well, I have n't been watching what you were doing!
Well if it was that easy, I do n't suppose they'd put it in in here would they?
Yeah, so if it were in the dictionary, I mean I know you able to turn to the.
Cilla Black?
Where's the connection there?
Mm.
No, I do n't think it is, I think it's too daft for Columbo but.
Well why not?
Mm.
Which, which are you going to miss out?
Which year?
We've got the ninety two one now!
I'll give you that when you come up.
Mm.
in your nineteen ninety one!
Did you look in the other one, the nineteen ninety edition?
No.
No.
What?
What have we missed?
Oh yes!
In fact, like that.
about month ago did n't they?
Cos you got the have n't they?
Mm.
That's me.
Mm.
No, I wanted that!
You wanted a chaise.
Which copy is that Brian?
Ah yes!
Anything you like there?
Or have n't you been through it?
Oh yes!
The, the erm the pine one?
Er yes.
It.
Is that talbot?
They're similar similar design but.
but.
much, much better!
I I think any resemblance is purely superficial.
Yes.
Missed the very beginning.
of it.
Mm!
Yes!
It was a standing davenport was n't it?
Yes, very unusual.
Wunderbar What was the er the thing that was interesting in that?
Er.
Ca n't remember now.
Yo, are you sure you've seen it or the one that was like it?
Mm.
Mm, on the, no no!
Er, ooh well I'm saying no!
Er.
I did n't read all the blurb.
Do n't know what it said.
No it does n't you a name.
Look here, the there's a programme on about er, Rembrandt here and it said of the ni, nine hundred and eighty eight Rembrandts in nineteen thirteen, only around three hundred are still thought to be genuine to a display of art.
galleries worldwide!
A lot of the, a lot of them were done by his pupils.
But er well!
Well!
Well!
Yeah.
That's.
about all Brian!
Yes.
I saw that from a book club.
It's a nice present that is n't it?
Er just a half a glass erm.
with toni, have you got any tonic water?
Well it's just that it's citric and er.

Erh.
Do n't do a a lot of supper for me Phyl, will you please?
Oh that's grand, yes!
to eat.
Oh that's alright.
Well, this is it!
ca governor!
We went along to the auction rooms this morning.
Er, well Ray let us in on a little oak table erm and forget to ring up to find out whether.
yes, got it or not.
Oh, I'll have to ring them in the morning.
But er, they had quite a few computers there, and I said to Ray find out how much the computers are.
Anyway, he said er and there were two or three identical you know, in monitors.
and erm the er what's his name?
And they were going.
er oh right.
Clatter, yeah.
Erm anyway, he said er oh he said they were about thirty two thirty two K those.
So I said, oh no, yes!
Looking for a something a little more modest than that!
But erm.
well well I said to him, I said, well whatever that is but er he said oh it might be five hu.
no it was five, he said he'll give about five hundred and.
fifty, you know?
Ee.
Yeah, I was gon na say it's a it's a business model is n't it?
Erm thirty two K.
But I said well he said, oh well you ca n't play games on it!
I said i I was n't thinking of that!
I mean, that's what the kids have got, the Commodores.
Something in between.
the two.
Well, I said these have obviously come out.
of offices, or businesses.
perhaps, you know hit the dust!
But erm sort of thought of something in between, but he said he said those will probably go for about five hundred and fifty.
I think he said.
And they had another one.
be ab, well this is it, yes!
Yeah!
I heard that Brian!
I heard that!
Have you found this chair that he was looking for in that?
I do n't think that chair could have been in that book Brian.
Probably seen it in the Radio Times.
In that programme, that's right!
You were just following instructions.
You mean a doorstep?
Erm.
Yep.
No, that's fine.
No, it's not quite the same Bri!
And you've been eating it all this time!
Let him ramble!
Tonic water.
Mm.
No, I do n't want any more orange juice, there's too much acidity in it!
So upset the old joints!
No, I prefer tonic water actually.
Especially for you Bri!
It's really saturated!
How's it going at work anyway?
You still working overtime or.
has it calmed down?
Oh yeah!
This is with this new company now?
Yorkshire!
Mm.
Mm.
Miss.
some help.
Yeah.
Well that's why he went probably!
Oh, he left of his own accord?
He was n't pushed?
And cause unemployment.
Yes,.
Mm.
Mm.
That's when accidents happen Brian!
What do you want to know about it?
No.
Well not not if I have salad on it, anyway.
Oh!
Mm.
They.
do!
They add a.
loaded.
Mhm.
Saffron.
What about rapeseed oil?
Is n't that very.
Mm.
Rapeseed that.

Mm.
Oh well we should n't have any rust.
Another twenty years, there'll be another turnabout.
wo n't there?
Saying, you should be eating butter!
Mm.
I was just going to say they said carrots.
a while ago did n't they?
Was the.
Diets.
Well I think we all are to a certain extent!
Everything in moderation.
is my answer.
Yeah, but I suppose they have to go by the general rule.
but I mean, you'll always find exceptions wo n't you?
You're pretty active though are n't you?
You're not very active?
And you're.
you're still fit.
Yeah.
Get the policy.
and get him to sign before he does anything else!
And stress!
Stress is probably a greater factor than has been allowed for up to now.
Pressure!
That'll keep you in black pudding for a while, Brian!
Early retirement.
Had they sold the boarding house?
Or have they.
Have they?
I thought you were gon na say the children are having it.
So what, what are they gon na do?
Worry.
Mind you, they've worked hard for.
quite a few years, have n't they, to build that place up?
She was a heavy smoker was n't she?
She is a heavy smoker, is she still?
Up there.
Mind you, I think the last few years they they'd sort of erm relaxed a bit more.
had n't they?
Well it's one of those occupations or businesses that he had to be there more or less.
well while he was building it up.
Round the clock was n't it?
It was no holidays for a.
few years.
He has n't?
Did it take him very long to sell it?
Mm.
Did he, did he have a the buyer have to sell some property?
Oh!
My birthday!
So that was quite quick then really.
was n't it?
Oh God!
Perhaps he's getting ready.
for the er, Manchester Olympics?
So.
They've got a house in Manchester have n't they?
Mm.
Home.
Mm.
Well!
That's it, I mean they can live on.
their investments I suppose.
Mm.
Well.
I was gon na say they're having the rest of their lives off by the sound of it!
So, they may Mm.
Oh well go back to the.
I hate them already!
Grinding the teeth!
I know you said he'd, ma, had all the rooms made.
en-suite.
And er.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well how long have they had it?
About seventeen years was it?
It may be about that.
Mm.
Initially.
Mm.
They converted all of it then did they?
Building mm.
Mm.
Well obviously he's built up his clientele over the years.
and er it's paid off.
Mm.
Off to the golf course.
Do what?
Mm.
Yes, that's right.
Before it gets too hot.
No but, I mean.
Well Cathy's mum and dad.
do it, you know.
Yeah!

Well no wonder they go up.
to the lakes a lot, cos I mean, it's beautiful.
up there, for walking is n't it?
Where are they?
Where is it?
I mean.
Mm.
Mm.
Is that going west is it, or east?
Ah!
It's in.
Yeah.
To the right, yeah.
on the map!
On.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
How long ago was that?
Mm.
You see in the lakes mm, I mean you pay much more though.
is n't it?
Mm.
Is it erm are there are any residents there?
Is it a residential?
Ah yes!
Not continuously occupy it.
Mm.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Freeze up.
Mm.
So is there somebody on the site all the time.
then?
Mm.
Oh it's on an elevated spot is it or the.
Oh that's nice because it's.
private.
And then it drums on the roof then!
Mm.
Especially in the night!
Yes yeah.
Well, I mean they're only thin walls are n't.
they?
Mm.
Mm.
Just were n't used to it you see.
Well there would n't.
be any heating in the bedrooms, I do n't suppose, would there be?
Just a.
The heaters are erm, in the kitchen or the lounge area I suppose.
Nice to spend time in the in the warm weather though.
Well er, I know what you mean.
and I understand that because I, I'd probably feel like that, I'd sooner invest in bricks and mortar even if were only a little end-terrace house.
than a caravan or a mobile home on a site.
Mm.
Mm.
But.
otherwise is it normally just a six year.
It does n't seem very long does it?
For six.
And wha you'd have to re.
You're not a reliable source.
of information Brian sorry!
Get your facts.

Ahhh!

No!
Hopeless with that on because of course, he's been wearing a pullover all the time and initially he had it clipped on the right hand side of his belts and of course, with that switch where is it?
The red switch there being right on the end when you depress that the play switch goes down as well.
But with him having on this side, because he's so blooming awkward he's been pressing the play switch and of course, so the tapes been turning round, have n't bothered to che, so you know, he was sort of saying well well play that tape and I'll write their names down of the people as they speak, just the first names, you know so there's loads of.
loads of blank spaces on these tapes!
And the rest of the time he's had this, sort of on, on the pullover here and of course it's so sensitive that it it picks up every rustle!
I mean he was talking to Norman over the fence the other day and it sounds like gunfire.
In in the microphone you know!
Every now and again the voice comes in.
I mean, it was a windy day as well and I do n't think that helped because the wind was sort of blowing into the mike but er and when he took it to college there was this noise all the time, he must have had it clipped under here somewhere!
I said, well you know it's got ta be.
it's got ta be outside the clothing!
But erm.
Well er, I think probably, I mean i so, this lady came on Friday and she's coming on Friday of this week to collect it or collect the tapes.
and she said you know, use as many as you can which which we have done and a lot of blank spaces on them!
Er.
Mm mm, no no, no.
Or Radio Two, tried but er but erm he's got sort of better.
I mean, today we've been to well we went into Henry and Norman's and they were having a chat and it's better if you're just sitting down like this with a mike just you know.
not attached really because it is very sensitive.
and I mean, unless yo, and they said do n't clip it near your throat because it would I felt like clipping it round his throat!
It er it would interfere with the erm.
with the reproduction so.
You're coming very close Brian!
She does n't mean it really!
But.
Really?
Did yo, have you been to any more since.
No.
Teresa's.
That's an i one on it's own.
Oh!
No.
Put them straight in and er get a bendy sandwich.

Yeah.
Oh!
Ooh how common!
Oh oh oh!
It's alright for sticking.
wallpaper down though!
Oh dear!
No, we do n't!
Oh well.
We do make exceptions.
Well you're not going!
No, off the back.
Only if it's got a special offer in it!
Yeah!
No wonder.

Yeah.
Er no I do n't think I'll have one.
No, no it's, it's.

Oh I'll have a little tinsy winsy then.
It's come to the end of the tape now anyway.

Yo ah I I was born in Liverpool and I mother, sort of a very old family a but erm.
Er I was born in the it's off erm I do n't suppose it's there any more erm.
what is the road that comes down erm joins erm you know where the Hippodrome er, used to be?
No, erm.
Yes!
It's at well i.
it no, and it, no.
this this road comes, well there's the Hippodrome there or was, I do n't suppose it's there now and you go, at this road here so it's this way on the West Derby Road comes this way.
Erm.
The Breacon Well there was one called the.
and you went up.
No, no.
Erm.
No.
No, Edge Lane is over that way.
No, no, you're going the other way!
Erm.
You know, going, as if you were going to erm do you know where the erm the, the funny thing was and the Brow, Everton Brow, there was a.
cafe place erm what's that.
thing?
What wa, what is it?
Yes.
The.
the old ladies we used make the erm Everton coffee.
Erm there was like a water tower thing in erm.
and a piece of a green railing rai, you know, if it was railed all round.
Erm well this road went up to erm Breckfield Road.
Well Breckfield Road North.
and then ran.
between.
No.
No.
I do n't think so.

Yeah.
and then we moved from there to er.
No, somewhere round er Queen's Drive,.
that wo, you know at the end of erm.
Yes, it was very nice! mum liked.
it, but pop did n't.
Because he printed the Echo and er when he was working late he could n't get out there.
And he missed his.
erm drinking partners I think.
So he.
decided that we're moving back further in you know.
back further in.
Which is a pity and then of course they started throwing bombs around and we, we were, we were evacuated.
to erm a place called Bridgenorth in between Bridgenorth and Kidderminster.
But the first time we went.
Where did we go first time?
We we, we went twice on tha, we were evacuated twice.
We went to Welsh Hanson first erm my mum went as a volunteer, er a voluntary helper to eight children in charge of eight children.
We used to troop behind her wherever she went.
We went sort of walk behind her like brown cow, you know!
And one day we were coming along and these local ladies were coming towards us said oh we love going down the country roads and you know, oh look at all these poor refugees!
Well it's just my mother, you know.

Refugees!
My dear ladies these children are in their own country!
They're not refugees.
