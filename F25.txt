He says he does n't know!
It's nothing to do with him!
But he said there is a gang going round, and some are putting the chimneys on and the others are going in and doing the flues.
And he said, it looks as though they've put the chimney on and found that the flue is the ba the boiler's in the bathroom, so they've had to come down here.
Said because it should n't have a chimney on it!
But he said, I do n't know it's no, nothing to do with me!
It's the.
Bri it's the British Gas that's doing it!
But he said, I would do it because I know, I've worked for the Gas board!

She's looking for somebody to back her up!
And that's why I can not get involved.
But we're gon na do it and she says she had n't as yet!
That's what she said.

I do n't think she said she's doing extra!
She says you'll have the bill for this!
A man just stated it!

And only letting it to friends and I suggest.
their grandson.

And they're bloody cooker's filthy!
It's true!
I have seen it.
I do n't think it's really clean, and they charge you for it!
Mm.
As he says it, it's the biggest holiday.
company in Britain and he said er, they just keep under their.
legal limit!
He said.
You ca n't get them to admit that.

She said thought, she'll only only let it out about six or eight times through the year!
Well they have n't got total control over letting it!
No.
Perhaps they'll go.
Ah a good!
Oh she's left her dolly in there!

What did you think of cleanliness and.
And then perhaps she'll take their names and addresses!
And the date see, Mrs so and so was in that caravan on such and such date!
If ever it came to court!
Cos he said somebody's got to bring them down!
And he said, we're disgusted with our caravan!
Well that's what I would say about this if this was new I would n't let people go in!
But she said they've let it to people and they've just wrecked the inside of it!
Everything she said!
It's a total mess!
And it's a brand new last July we've had it, she said!
And it's filthy!
And how did she put salt round?
Because this is a hell of a lot damper today than what it was when I had the salt about you.
Course not!
But she yes, she told me that in all, in the shop.
In the reception.
She said, put it.
down.
Yeah but it attracts the.
water in.
the air, into the salt!
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Mm.
It's collected the water.
So how else do you keep it dry?
She said, straight to me now!
I said that caravan is soaking wet, I said!
The mattresses!
And she said er well it does take time for them to dry out does n't it, she said?
But I, there was people in it last week!

Oh!
Get tho get those stools out.
Not brand new!
It was new to us!
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ah know.
we've stated.
Well we came.
We came down my son came down here month and he and er, put red lead all underneath it.
You know the?
Following Sunday I came down to wash it and polish it and now we've got blue stickers in the bathroom the heater!
And the.
And they know it!
So we did and we've.
heard no more about it!
Well there's a great.
On the Sunday we were here.
that blue thing was on the window!
But now it's got red across it, failed!
And that was n't there.
I do n't know!
Did n't know anything about it!
was er absolutely.
Three years, or two years, I dunno!
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm!
No.
Yeah.
Well two weeks ago.
Last week there was people in here!
So how could that water be like it is?
Cos you ca n't use it!
There is no hot water!
I tell you!
Well I.
No it's.
He said he'd be one of the first.
He's putting the flues on and he has n't come down to check it so if he's down here I'm gon na bloody tell him.
Yeah.
And still they've condemned it.
Yes, it's surely their van.
And other flues all down along there.
All on the grass see?
It's coming out of here.
This bloke, he said.
One of them goes round putting the chimneys on and the other checks the flue.
So I'll tell him that the fire will be on.
There's some in the van there.
Having their dinner.
Yeah.
Perhaps they've been in and done it now.
bloody thing.
And the first booking for the caravan, she just said it again.
I've got it on my tape is th the twenty first of March.
When the first comes in.
On the twenty first of March.
Third did he? the first which was the Sunday and he had to get it ready because they were coming in on the Tuesday, on the third.
That's why there was such a mad panic to get it done on the Sunday the last day before So why are the mattresses back there getting bloody damp?
Oh I forgot to give him them.
Mark is n't coming over to pick the car up.
He does n't want to.
He's enjoying his break.
Mark loves it.
Loves being on his own.
What the bloody hell is that?
Montrose twenty eight.
R twelve.
It's the key of somebody's caravan but it's not ours.
I'll go and try these in the door now cos this is ours.
Look at that old thing squat on the roof.
It is.
But they've got the bloody labels mixed up by the look of it.
Yeah I'm gon na try the both.
That is it.
Well what the hell is that?
Montrose, twenty eight.
R twelve and that one's J twelve.
this is.
one.
Well who's are these?
Mark.
It's nothing, these are n't nothing to do with Mark.
They belong in the.
Yes.
This is a caravan smell and Mrs's clothes used to stink by it.
Oh I do n't believe this!
Could n't be bothered to shop.
I'll give them all to Mark.
And then I'll go up the shop and get some, I'll need a couple of boxes.
Where's the microwave?
Ooh god.
No paper.
I've got ta have er paper to leave messages.
I was gon na ask Mark for a pen.
A big note.
So that I can say the fire's burning.
Yeah but I want it for the men that's going to alter the gas.
For signs.
I'm gon na put one in there one on the kitchen.
and one by the fire.
Yeah.
Then all the doors should be open see.
See if they leave the doors open it's not too bad.
Oh well.
Feel this and feel those beds in there.
His home.
No that's wet.
Yes it's wet.
Yeah them all.
Well I'm just gon na get the paper and that's it.
Eh?
Yeah.
any toilet paper.
No paper or Have n't got pens there.
No pens.
No tissues.
Any tissues?
Erm.
Let's go down the toilet, see if it's open.
No wait a minute.
No wait a minute.
disconnected the gas, took that bloody old heater off, connected it up somewhere else and whatever they're gon na do and then the gas is coming through a fire.
Mhm.
Oh it'd be better for him to put that fire on at night time and go over in the morning and switch it off.
Have to.
And if he's gon na walk to Tenby they could be starting when he's in Tenby.
Well Sally'll go with him.
Yeah?
If those men was n't going there I would say right, put the gas fire on.
Put it on low and leave it the night and day cos it was left on for a week once was n't it?
Dunno Oh nan he says, get Mark.
Mm?
Well you either put one bar on or the lot is on or it's very dim like this is low and you ca n't see it at all.
There is heat.
But you ca n't see it.
Well Danny says get Mark and bung them in the bloody car and bring it home.
Well we could put it in the spare bedroom.
Put it up against the radiator.
Mm.
Well I dunno.
You do n't have to.
Have a drink and it disappears.
Oh I dunno.
And this is Marks and Spencers?
Mm.
Well I suppose he could.
Well I would n't bloody.
No way.
Dunno.
Belongs to the caravan.
Because that is the mattress for the bed that folds away in the sitting room.
Right?
It is.
Cloth.
Yeah.
It's a cloth cover on it.
It's foam.
Yes.
Because it's wet and it's damp.
It is n't plastic, it's foam!
Oh god, yes.
What?
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest would n't go in.
But then the little bedroom was n't so did n't seem so damp.
Mm.
Mm.
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied.
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in.
They done it.
Because they put it back there for these people that was coming in.
We do n't know.
Do we?
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the.
Perhaps the people were in the van and found the beds wet and said well we ca n't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
Eh?
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You do n't know.
So you ca n't swear to that then.
You ca n't, no.
And then again alright, the fire was condemned on the sixth.
Well those people were only there from Tuesday to Friday.
And the sixth was a Friday.
So it could have been condemned as they were going.
Neither have I.
That's why I.
Yeah.
Well their girls have got ta sleep in them.
Well then you might as well push that little thing in as well might n't you?
But Mark wo n't be there when you take them back.
Mm.
Mhm yeah, I could take them back Friday.
How am I gon na get them in the van?
In, back into the caravan.
On me own.
It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress.
I ca n't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to.
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's got ta get out.
Well I dunno.
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle is n't it?
If someone else.
I would n't worry at all.
I would n't hesitate.
Mm.
If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on.
Yes.
Mark wo n't be there to see to it?
Because how does M Mark know?
Mark right, he's got up this morning and he's gone to Tenby.
And he's gone to look around Tenby.
While he's gone those men have gone in there.
That's what I mean.
He ca n't be standing there watching the bloody thing all the time.
Well they've got to have n't they?
To disconnect the gas.
Gas.
A gas water heater!
They've got ta disconnect the gas to get the water heater off the wall.
And fix it to the.
Oh you do n't understand!
In the meantime the men have took the water heater off the wall.
They've put it from that wall, and they've stuck it on to this wall.
Oh let's connect it up see if it works.
Now in the meantime there's gas seeping through that fire there with no light.
So you've blown your caravan.
Well no.
Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other.
No.
That's what I says.
If those men was n't working there I would n't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low.
and the atmosphere would warm up right through the caravan.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday.
and done their work and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday the caravan's great now, the fires are alright.
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ai n't got the keys.
the only thing again that I'm thinking of what if we gets them out of the caravan and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?
Mm.
Mm.
Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said.
There's nobody can sleep in those.
Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said erm yours was erm the driest of them sort of thing.
And I said.
I said then well I said from the time now, I said there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses.
No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out.
So in other words you do n't go to the caravan.
. Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there.
Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?
So?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
The caravan!
Well that subject's gone!
I'm saying that Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans last summer.
end of last summer.
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Not really.
Do n't think so.
Not.
What?
Do n't know.
And another thing, I did n't even look in Mark's room.
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his caravan?
I did n't look.
Dunno.
Oh well Well I dunno I think I'll go and wash me hair.
It's desperate for it.
Is it?
What?
Well you can have one.
Good god, you can have one now if you want it.

I hope you know I'd er see he'll have to put the back seat of the car down into a van.
Shit I'm afraid in case those mattresses rip.
Because they're so thin.
It's not that I'm afraid of a patch.
The beds, the big beds are.
The small beds are n't.
Well you can get erm two foot bunk beds nan.
But they're not spring mattresses.
Although what's on the bed is nice mattresses.
Yes.
He wo n't eat it.
Well the thing is he does n't have a dinner every day of the week.
And then he looks forward to the weekends and that.
Look at the ruddy traffic.
Oh the lights have come higher up now.
The lights have been moved up the road.
Where?
Yeah.
Still, net curtains on them.
When you've net curtains on them.
Mm?
Mm.
Oh god.
Now I need the key.
Gon na need the key for this.
the west end of London.
East end then.
East end.
No.
I do n't think that the pub is open the cafs are n't open the amusements are n't open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
We went there, had a look.
Dunno.
When he asked me when they opened.
I do n't know I said.
And what time do they shut?
And I said I do n't know but I said I should n't think it would be too late.
I dunno.
And er.
Well I dunno.
I left it there and then went down the caravan.
When we come back he'd got the dishes all ready for me.
No the dishes.
Mm?
She gave me a key.
She told me here's your keys now she said because you've lost a set.
Well why did n't you tell me?
You told me they'd got a set of keys.
So she give me a set of keys.
And erm I give them to Mark.
And I told him I want them back, do n't take them to the office.
I went in there again and I told her that you'd rung and some Angela from sales Andrea, we have n't got an Andrea she said.
So she said somebody else it could have been.
I said I do n't know I said.
No.
But erm she said she has said that we could do this and she said that's fine, she said.
As long as you do n't as long as you do n't put erm anything too near it.
And I said Mark's here so that he can switch it switch it off at nights.
So anyway while I was there Darren came in.
Is everything alright?
He said.
Are all the jobs done?
And I said well look I said, I've got to come because I said there's no way anybody I said I would n't do it myself, I would n't put anybody in those beds.
I said something's got to be done and it wo n't wait.
And I said I'm going to leave the fire on and er Mark's here and he'll switch it off at night.
That's alright she said.
Let's see she said, th when's the first when's your first booking?
Not until, I think she said April twenty first.
That's our first booking, paid booking.
Nothing about these ones that's already been in.
Susan is there she said the twenty first and I on the twenty first.
But she would n't be on their books like that would it?
Yes.
Well perhaps she was talking about Sue then.
I do n't know.
I did n't really stop to find out.
And er she said that'll be alright.
And Mark's there, I said he'll switch it off at night.
Fine she said, as long as there's nothing left too near the fire.
So I took the envelope off those tickets and I tore that up and wrote down and I stuck it in the water heater that the sitting room fire may be on, please check.
I put another one then on the draining board.
Cos if they're going to fix it round the sink, he does n't know where they're gon na put it.
You know, while I was there Darren came in.
And he said er have all the jobs been done yet?
And I said well no I said there's some water I said.
Mark's on holiday this week I said.
they've put him in another.
Oh that's right he said.
I heard something about this he said, er I was on holidays all last week he said but erm it's bloody lies cos I saw him last week.
And he said erm yeah he said cos we've got ta pay this he said because it's all in the guarantee.
In the warranty.
And he came in and I said and the mirror on the dressing table is n't done.
You know and that's gone and I said feel these beds I said.
They're soaking wet.
And he felt them and he said they are a bit he said.
So I said well I Danny rang this morning and he got permission to put the fire on and put them, I'm going to move them all into the front and erm to air them up.
And I said there's no way anybody can sleep in there.
That's alright he said.
And he checked and then he went So I took the bags off the pillows in case they were sweating in the bags and I put them out on the seats.
I put the quilts all out on the seats.
And.
Because there's eight there's er seven, there's eight pillows then and.
Yeah.

Mm?
The girl in the coun the girl behind the counter, the little tiny one.
Small and.
tiny.
Yes.
She said how's Danny then?
And I said oh he's at home I said this week I said and that oh and she said well tell him to get over here and we'll sort him out.
I said eh I said when Danny comes in he'll sort you out.
And she laughed about it.
Darren said you know the girls in the were saying that you were n't well, how was you and one of these days.
I do n't know what this is all for.
And he said will you be there?
And I said well I do n't know.
It depends now how er mm I do n't know.
tea?
Oh.
He made a mistake.
Terrible.
Mm.
Well Mark is quite contented where he is.
Ooh it's out of this world.
I mean you ca n't compare it can you?
And the bedrooms!
You ca n't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans.
That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said.
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well he'll have plenty of matches then.
And I took them in, he says what do you buy them for?
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
Fridge, light switches ooh beautiful thing it is.
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps they must let it out though.
Why's Malcolm got it?
I would n't.
I would n't.
let it.
No.
He's right up by the wishing wheel well or whatever it is.
You know this reproduction furniture?
And the little lead windows?
That's got it all inside it.
And the shower has n't got a curtain it's got a big black door.
No.
Quite a few people there today.
Whether it was the fine weather bringing them out or yesterday.
Eh?
Mm.
I would do that next year.
Mm?
I'd do that next year.
We never saw that old girl trudging round today.
And what is the make of it?
And this woman said that she stated no animals.
But she said they tell you that and she said they tell you, it's on computer she said, but animals do go in the vans.
Mm I know, that's what she said.
I do n't how she knows.
That's what they said though.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
Pillows.
Pillows.
She had to pay for eight pillows.
And she was so toffee-nosed as if they said the curtains.
Oh yes I'll have them c got ta have them done.
If I, if you wanted to go down there and scrub the van out, you go and scrub it out.
And I will next year.
What?
Darren was there.
Yeah.
He come to see.
Yeah, further down.
I even went, I was dying to go to the toilet so I thought oh I'll go down to the big er and I had no toilet paper so I'll go down to the big toilets and shower rooms.
They're all locked.
Everything's locked there.
No.
Not even the holder it was on.
Gone.
Mm.
Yeah, they took one.
in case they needed the toilet.
Well it's gone.
And the cardboard roll off it.
I wonder who's got that grocery store?
It goes out to tender I expect.
Yes, it's could be like Thomas shop.
He has it for so long.
Mm.
And then you've got ta go.
You've got ta put in tenders for it then.
Cos they must make a bomb though.
Cos a lot of stuff is n't in.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.
I dunno.
Well the man with the bike, that's his business.
And the ma and the people then with clothes last year, who were they now?
To the shop?
Well he did n't have a fire on, nothing.
He was just lying there watching telly and reading the paper and.
Mm.
No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week part in it.
Because he said there's no point, I do n't want it.
Yeah.
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his wo n't be ready or something.
Mm.
All the machines and everything are switched off in there.
Well that's Wednesday.
Will Sally be able to go with him?
The show is up in the other rooms.
Huge big rooms up there.
We did n't go up there.
And there's a big dance hall there.
We did n't go into them because they were all closed up.
Yeah well George's the drippy one.
George and Mildred.
Well what does he do then?
Gon na say I do n't think he could go on his own, go down on his own.
Mm.
Reg On the Buses was like that as well.
His sister and her husband, forget her name.
Arthur was the husband.
Mm.
Oh there we are.
No I dunno Sally works on a Monday.
Finishing at eight?
Oh.
That's alright then.
But I really should have looked at me plants.
I should have looked at me plants today.
Anyway our Darren came in, and I'm gon na forget Darren came to the caravan and I was telling him about these wet sheets and beds and the mirrors done and what I was doing there and Oh he said and about the mattress he said and I said to him mattress, it's still the same mattress.
Yes he said, I've got ta wait he said.
I'll be putting a new mattress in er I'll be putting another mattress in.
And he said I've got to put after dark.
What do you mean after dark?
I said.
He turned round well I've got to move about discreetly he said.
And I said erm you talking about then?
And he said oh I've been taking it out of one of our own caravans, our own caravans he said.
new one.

Or she'll be looking a bear skin!
And her super warm coat!
Well she could n't of had it colder than when dad was in hospital!
And by hell it was cold!
Bitter cold!
And wet!
And blowing!
You could n't had it worst!
The only you could of had was the snow!
Ooh, but that was!
Well she shivered!
And she shivered!

and she said as, well what she used to say about it was nobody's business!
And it must have been cold bloody flat!
Must of been, cos they'd been out all day.
No fire, no nothing on!
And then to go home, tired and cold in an empty place, and cold and must of been terrible!
Well she erm she ca n't remember exactly!
But Rowan and her went on Boxing Day.
When did David and Pam go?
Cos she did n't sleep here.
So they all must have gone out for the dinner.
So they must of stayed until erm Boxing Day, Christmas Day rather.
Wish they was.
.And they went on Boxing Day dinner.
They had their dinner and went!
Yeah, David and Pam and Margaret all slept at the flat!
And they must of come over for Christmas dinner.
Yes, because David tucked into his er Christmas pudding!
He loved it!
And Pam was shouting about the bloody cholesterol!
And then they had Boxing Day dinner.
And David and Pam must have gone as well, cos Margaret went with Rowan.
Up Newtown way, they were going up to Ruth.
And.
I shall bloody quiz her about that!
And er David and Pam must of gone the other way you know, they'd gone their way home, and had gone her way home.
But er and then Astra was here and she was going bloody North!
She goes ey and it's colder up there!
Well she found it cold here and she.
Oh it was hysterical because it was blowing a gale!
Violet and me were over cleaning your flat.
That was the day you was taken into hospital and she was in the bed, cos they were on their way down so we were changing the bloody beds!
And you come down through the alley way and you could not keep your feet on the floor!
You could move!
And we'd got these bags,, I said just bang all the sheets into bin bags, we can wash them next week if you think I'm starting!
But make sure, you know, you well you take over the house, so we know what's in them in case they get thrown out with the bloody rubbish!
So we put them all into bin bags and we was trying to carry these bin bags so the wind was taking them like balloons!
And you were hanging on and trying to keep your feet on the floor!
God, I laughed!
And then er they came.
I ca n't remember what time or anything about it.
I think they must have come to the flat.
They'd been for a meal and they came to the flat and they rung us to say they were there.
Something like that, I ca n't remember.
And then, the next day they came over.
The next day they came over.
And this gale was still blowing!
And it was blowing!
You just could n't.
No, they did n't!
No they did n't get, be there till eight!
Just eight-ish something like that.
Cos they'd been for a meal on the way as well!
Cos I've said come over for supper.
No, they did n't want supper.
Cos they'd had this meal.
And erm then the next day they came over and David was laughing, he said, do you, do you know the alley way down between he said, well it blew it her up right against that bloody wall he said!
Well Aunty could n't move he said!
He I and I said, and you laughed at her?
Course I did he said!
And I said, did you help her?
No, I did n't.
Let her battle it out he said!
Well they came over here then and they'd been up and they come back with Gillian and all that and they stayed.
And they went from here about nine-ish I suppose?
They'd had supper anyway.
Then they were going over and they were gon na go to bed.
They'd been to the hospital, and they'd been over the flat so I said to them well pop the blankets on and come over here then and have your supper and go back.
And the beds will be nice and warm for you to get into.
But anyway, they left here about nine o'clock.
Well she'd gone out through the door and the wind took her down the bloody street!
I said to though, he said she was going there another way!
And David was there.
was laughing!
And it was just she was running with it!
There's just her battling against it!
Oh and we laughed about it!
And I said, better go and collect her!
But David said look at shifting!
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, but it is n't summer yet!
It is n't summer yet!
It's about ninety there now!
Eighties.
Well she'll have bloody shock if she was here in the summer then!
Could n't live in the winter!
They are, they're the, the same.
Anyway you get a mosquito bite.
I could never live with the window shut!
Yeah cos they have it keep pushing!
Same here!
One place to another!
Yeah, but it's all the same.
not too nice.
It is n't fresh!
I was saying Danny the other day do you remember the time he came and got out his in there?
I would get a piece of erm well I got a piece in the greenhouse it would n't worthy of it then, but it does n't matter!
Piece of board and fix in the doorway and fix it open.
Put it high enough so that the cats would n't come, but leave it then.
It's just a big window open.
Cos then yo, once you have the doors closed as low as that cos no air gets in!
We opened the.
You open the top and then let the cats in at the bottom!
So I put a board across there.
Sliding window inside.
What do they call them?
Yeah.
