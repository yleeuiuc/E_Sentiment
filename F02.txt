But he was, he was threatening him anyway and he said Pete was.

Yeah.
She's been in a shop with him I think.
Yeah, they'll!
Erm why, why was he doing that on Friday?
Well she's got a theory but go on.
Were you?

Oddly enough!
I went cos it was then I goes to Pete, oh no I ought to go out really, and he goes no you're not!
Sort of looked at me and went okay.
I'm not arguing!
I wonder if they listen to these?
If you are listening.

Go on.

Mr,.
I bet they know you.

Oh let's not all talk at the same time!
Let's be Magic Roundabout people!

No let's let's loo.
Well, no not a little.
six foot three pixie!
Mm.
Get a life!
So what did he do?
What did Shrimpy do on Friday night?


Richard not known as Mersey Tunnel Gob or anything!
Oh dear!
Ahhh no!
I ca n't believe it!
But Pete reckoned it was because like cos like Pete's seeing Susan.
and like.
and he was with me.
and he reckoned Pete was a total bastard and everything!
Even though he does n't know Susan he a.
he reckons Pete's cheating on Susan, he's been really bad to Helena as well he's just using them and all.
this business.
I mean, who's taking advantage of him.
I mean, on both times it's been me taking advantage of him, it really.
because.
he's been both times and I have n't.
Mm mm.

He's so funny though!
He cracked me up, he goes like, like with that I mean.
Well like I said, I said that, I said that to Pete and Pete goes, God I wish he'd make up his mind!
So he'd obviously sa not said it, I mean Pete was really shocked!
He'd.
obviously not said anything to Pete about me.
so I dunno!
Mm.
Yeah.
It's his house everyone goes to is n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
He's a really nice person!
I mean the I mean, like, I mean, people say it that a personality makes up for like, looks or whatever, and with hi, he's the only person I've ever met where it really really does!
His personality is just so nice!
And he's.
such a lovely person he really is!
You know and I.
just think ahhh, you know?
No.
Like I get, I mess about with him and like.
cos like, he told everyone about me and Pete and everything, you know?
Like what him and Joe had an argument about.
But er you know?
No, I'm not gon na, I'm not gon na say it on the tape,!
But I mean he did, well he, he knew, I told him.
but I mean, him and Joe were in the room at the same time.
You know, and I you know, I sort of told him.
Well I did.
tell him!
And he, but he did n't actually tell anybody.
I mean, he made a few comments a but nothing that anybody could tell.
I mean, everybody knows now anyway.
What?
What?
No, I di, I had one on my neck.
I had one.
I had one there.
you might just.
be able to see the last little of it.
And I've got a ye nice yellow bruise there.
And I've got one on my back.
Thought it was just there somewhere.
It's probably gone now actually.
Just there.
It was just there.
But there wa, I've got.
a nice yellow bruise still there.
Mhm.
Joanne told me about that you.
can see it straight through it!
Mm.
Mm.
I did n't even know they were there to be quite honest.
I got.
up the next morning and, cos I had that you know, that stripy top on?
And my mum, my mum was sat in The Weathers with me and I'd talked to her and everything and I did n't even know that that.
one was there!
And like, but like, I got.
up the next morning and I just went oh Jesus!
They were like.
still.
up there and the one on my back as well!
Mm.
I mean, I only had that one on my neck and I thought and like I was I was!
collars!
Like, my dad le, like I was doing the crossword or something my dad leant over me and I went, yeah, oh really!
I have n't actually got a neck!
Mm.
Collarbone yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.


I mean, I mean it wo that was pro, the lightest one on my.
neck!
Oh!
And I was thinking, oh I wa honestly I did n't know they were there.

Yeah.

Mm.
Oh got a nasty.
bruise there!

my cups down my cups down to my waist!
Mm.
Mm.
Comfortable then?


But I mean.
But, I could n't believe it cos I he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?
And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I do n't.
like them!
Ooh that's.
Oh, how sick!
Ah what a gay!

I'd never tell my mum that!
Like, luckily they're.
no, not very big but I've still got the one, I've still got, and it's right next to it as well!
Now it's yellow now it's going!
But, ah.
ah Jesus!
At least.

Girls do n't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they?
I certainly do n't think so anyway.
I think it looks awful on boys!
I mean, it looks bad enough on girls but I mean.
Yeah.
But I did n't that's why it's.
that's why I.
I did n't tell anybody.
At school.
Really funny!
But I ca, honestly when Pete phoned me up and like, I was getting so worried!
And he's going.
I know.
He did, he.
he did actually bite me!
He did.
Well.
it killed!
It really.
hurt!
I screamed!
I went I went.
I actually went arghhh You've got ta to!
And and like then, like them two they're being, and they goes what's up?
I goes, nothing!
Nothing!
You know, and it really hurt!
But I mean but Joe said they were actual bite marks and it was n't.
there was n't actually bite marks, but he did bite me, but.
they was like love bite marks.
And I think, so Pete was n't right and she was n't right either.
But.

I've only got three!
I mean they were n't very bad or anything but.
I mean Jesus Christ!
has n't he?
Oh I asked him.
I asked him whether he was and.
he said that he wa he did n't know, he was either coming now or was going to Tramps.
But.
I think he'll probably go to Tramps to be quite honest.
I think.
prob, I think Susan might be going actually.
And if it's a toss up between me and Susan it's, yeah Susan!
You know?
But I I.
No.
Mm.
But like, he even said it, he said to me when I was drunk and I, and it pissed me off a little bit actually cos like, he goes to me you know like I I was saying about it and he goes erm well she was the one who wanted it all casual and everything, and I said oh yeah.
And he goes he goes yeah well, I do it because she does it!
And I'll, I thought, I goes.
I'll I'll.
No, I go, I I went, oh thanks very much!
I do n't think he heard me!
Yeah and I went oh thanks!
Well I did n't actually but he was arsed I just said oh thanks very much!
Like.
and went and sat in the corner of the bathroom and went, scowled at him for a bit!
But you know.
I dunno! hey?
Mm.
But erm like, I'm putting out of bounds signs on my mum's and brother's.
Well I said to.
You can you come in here.
As long as I'm not in here.
Three people!
Or you can go in the bathrooms.
But.
like everyone's jealo, a, like everyone's jealous of me at school and I would n't say I'm over tall!
But.
like you know, loads of people are smaller than me!
I'm, I, you know I'm going off.
with one of the tallest!
Mm.
Stop eating!
Mm.
I like my legs.
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not fat that way, I'm like that way.
Mhm.
But like, like, I mean Andy, Andy goes yeah, like, cos we were talking about that, and he goes, yeah you've got childbearing hips!
He goes, unlike my sister who's got house-bearing hips!
Yeah, I went Shhh!
Yeah, I felt, I feel a bit sorry for Hannah actually cos.
she's alright, but.
Mm.
Yeah.
She eats.
Mm.
She is a bit!
I feel really sorry for her actually.
cos I'm I know if I had it I'd just feel really awful if I had BO.
I ca n't!
If it was someone really close to me.
I would.
I've told.
my brother he had it before.
I go God, oh your breath stinks ca n't you?
But it do n't matter if you offend him does it?
Really?
God you stink!
Yeah.
I know it's like.
it's like Fiona at school right he, o, Vicky and Iona were having this ma, major crisis about whether to tell her she's got B O?
Cos I do n't know whether it's BO, but she just smells to quite honest!
And she's a really nice person, right, she's a bit portly.
like, she's coloured right, but she's a bit portly and she just smells to be quite honest!
And she's got this smell, yo, it's her smell do you know.
what I mean?
And like you da, ca n't tell it, like just walking around or whatever, if you're sitting right next to her and she leans over you.
or when she's on the trampoline and you're.
standing by the trampoline.
Oh it's just horrific!
And everyone just goes.
You know, and it's.
really awful!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh have they?
Finally!
And wha.
Oh you smell!
Mm.

Yeah she's like, really clean cut is n't she?
Even, even, even no, but even more.
than that, I mean I mean, I'm not being nasty but I mean look at our hairdo's!
I mean we're not exactly, well I'm so worried about you know.
how I look just at this second or anything!
I know, but like she says, she's hair and everything is n't she?
And all her make up and she got and she's really pretty really.
is n't she?
Have yo, have yo.

Yes.
And I just went mm!
Ha!
And I knew exactly what it was you they were talking about!
But do you know I went why?
Why did I do that?
Why am I.
Ah!
But I.

And I goes but I had to, I had to, I goes why?
And he goes well I've got some money in it!
I've got my Visa card in it!
I goes why Pete, really evilly!
And he went and he went well what do you think?
And I just went Jesus!!
I was just so ooh!
I just think, oh no what am I gon na do now?
Could n't really.

Not really.
But Clare is going like I told Clare about it.
I do n't know.
No, her boyfriend is up.
but I think he's going home tomorrow.
Is that Joe?
Having a butchers ay.
Shall I turn the light off so you can see?
Oh!
Oh!
Why is he hanging round Steven again?
He must be sad character, and that's the only reason why!
Yeah.
That's why I've got my hair like this!
While I was taking the dog out.
Do you wan na poster?
U 2.
It's that one that used be up there.
Yeah.
Yeah, have it!
Oh you're taking that.
down?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
I thought you meant you were moving it from there.

!
But erm oh what was I gon na say?
I could n't believe Clare though!
Cos she goes erm she goes I told her right and she goes well you're going to are n't you?
I goes what?
She goes, she goes well you might say that now but when you actually get there you'll really want to.
And er I goes you know, I was a bit, I was a bit shocked really, cos like.
Clare's never told me that she'd done anything with Stuart.
You er but when we were talking about this she told me that.
he'd asked her to go on the pill.
No.
She did n't want to!
So she's not going to.
But erm I'd, I do n't but like chat to her cos she's, honestly she's such a nice person and like.
she's one of them people who she might be a little bit like hard to talk to at first.
but if you like, just go absolutely crazy like I do!
Cos she's used to me being crazy!
Like going ooh, ooh!, you know!
You know the way I do.
And er ah, she'll be alright.

Ooh er look!
But er.
What do.
Oh dear, so like I say I'd you know chat, you know chat away to her because I.
think, cos she really wants to come but like.
She's she's such a swot it's unbelievable!
I mean, she reckons I'm a swot, and I reckon she's a swot, you know!
It's really funny!

That's what er.
But er.
I hope she does come actually cos like she's a real good laugh.
You know, she's really nice!
And an anyway I wan na get her drunk and chop all her hair off so she's looks hideously ugly!

Mm.
She's so pretty as well!
No.
I do n't know her but.
I've probably, I've probably seen her but.
Mm.
I've heard the name.
Oh my God!
Yeah.
I think if you've got a really nice colour ging, you can have, either have a hideous colour ginger.
or a really, really nice!
Mm.
Rusty.
Mm.
Well you see that you see, she probably looks at it every day and thinks, oh hideous!
But, you see, you see it every day and think, ah that's so lovely!
But it's everybody, everyone thinks they're ugly do n't they?
I mean like.

Oh.
It takes honestly it takes so much willpower to grow your hair it really does.
It get, it gets, it gets to about that length.
Oh that was n't shoulder length.
If you, you get it to a certain length and it's a bit too short to have the layers cut out, cos you need it all the same length really and it pisses you off so much.
Yeah.
Cut.
It's too sh.
Yeah.
If you can have it c if you can have it cut all one length it's alright then.
If you leave it for so long though.
it starts cleaning itself and it's alright then.
But you have to leave it for like months.

A dur brain.
I used to have a teacher called Mrs.
I did.
At nursery school I had a teacher called Mrs.
But everyone laughed.
I get up at eight every morning.
Mm.
No er in between school and not working?
Well how do you think you're gon na pay for all that?
Government, do you know how much grant you'll actually get?
Does it?
It wo n't pay all my brother's cos they're cheapskating bummers.
Mm.

He does already.
Sorry.
Oh.
What that bloke sitting behind?
Looks like Mr oh having a ride in.
Oh I wonder what, I wonder what er, what party he's for?
Oh no.
it's Neil.
Why do n't they show us all Britain?
Oh no.
cor this is a bit ugh ah let's all clap for Neil, er, er what's he gon na do go off and have a boxing match?
Oh sorry.
just sounds a bit silly if you can only hear the telly.
Eh?
Yeah.
get the full grant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you knew, cos we told you.
what you get.
Yeah because they think they're going to get more, do n't they?
Or they thought they were and the only people they're going to get any more from is the parents, nowhere else, nobody else is going to give them anything I've got no illusions about it, I do n't expect you to get anything from anywhere else, and I know that you, you would n't get anything from anywhere else because they, they've cut it, they've cut it to the bone and the only people that can afford to go now and to live in anything like.
Yeah, is people who have got rich parents.
Lives at Bromsground?
Yeah.
No it might, it might.
be the year after.
I think, I think actually, I think they will try to do something actually because if they, if they do away with the loans thing.
they'll have to try do something wo n't they?
To be honest.
oh no, no it's not no.
no, they ca n't do that because of the state of the economy.
Well hopefully they'll be able to do something.
Yeah.
No.
But I mean.
you know, I mean, on.
on April the tenth they're not going to be able to go.
oh, you know, that's, that's it because for thirteen years they have dismantled the social system, that's what they've done in thirteen years, so they ca n't say overnight, we'll put it all back because there is n't, there, there is n't the finance there because they've spent it all to have done what they've done.
because they've sold everything off like gas and electricity and everything and all the resources they've got for it they've spent, to supplement everything else, so the money wo n't be there, and, and the income from the electricity and that is n't going to the Government it's going to private enterprise.
so, so it's not gon na be there, and unfortunately it's going to take a while, because we're in such a deep recession and recession is bad, and it's not getting any better.
It, it'll take a long time before it starts to buck up.
Yeah, to put it right, to start to put it right.
yeah well I mean they'll want to and they've got.
Yeah, but they've got.
they've got to try and show.
that they are doing something.
No because you should help, think of a society as whole.
No.
Yeah.
Well is he going to university?
What doing?
But the only, I think the only course he'll pass is mucking about course, let's see who can muck about for the next three years the most.
Stupid innit?
If you have n't got, if you have n't got enough discipline to get a good grade in your O levels.
then you no way gon na have enough discipline to get any sort of grade at university.
And you got.
Do you know what I was talking to Nicola.
I, I.
I did n't get involve with it, I mean I got involved in it and I did it.
If there's one, if there's one next year I will, depending on what it is of course.
but I would n't, I would n't mind next year, but it's just too much hassle just at the moment, and if you look hardly anyone out of our year's in it are they?
But David's decided to get involved in this in his sixth year coming up to his A levels.
Yeah, he had to borrow the money off me to do that.
Who?

, er.

Compilation.
I'm taping it now.
I am.
A survey thing.
Yeah.
you ca n't show this because I did n't put a bra on.
she's got a microphone on her blazer.
I have, yes it is.
I ai n't got the headphones.
It is.
OK this conversation was between Alison Nina, Helena, Caroline and somebody who is unknown, OK.
What you gon na do?
Ask her for it I am, she's alright, she's.
Yeah, she's always been alright with me, you know, so I ca n't say about anybody else, I mean she's already, she's always been really nice to me, but like them people she goes around, well she used to go around with Lisa and Vicky and all that lot and when she used to go around with them she used to be bitching them off behind their back and going oh you're my best friend, to their faces.
It's like me and you really, huh,.
I know I bitch by you.
I'm saying how much I hate you, just all the time.
I suppose it's a bit like me and Joanne really I mean I'm bit er nasty to her behind her back really, only to her.
not anybody else about her.
she's alright actually, sometimes she just aggravates me though.
No.
I mean she's a, she's a nice enough person but she just gets in a strop so easily, you, you know.
Yeah probably I think she'll always be like it though, cos her mum's just the same, she's just like her mum, you know her mum got in a strop every day because she could n't go round, down the.
club and have a fag, her mum's given up smoking, so Joanne's really worried now oh.
silly old Jo.
mm.
I know someone who had that done and then later on they had their voice box taken out, cos he had cancer of the throat, ooh,.
oh they cut them out.
why?
Yeah, he could n't speak after that.
no I.
if I were you, that is just.
oh no way, that is.
Oh god, having problems putting a pair of tights on.
Nearly black.
God knows, my mum.
Oh that's nice.
you would n't have to worry about, you would n't have to worry about trousers or skirts or legs.
heck, oh my knees face each other, it's sick.
no it is n't, we.
to it anyway.
You've been playing too much football.
you're born with rickets.
mine are too thin at the ankle, looks sick.
oh yeah, yes you have.
Yeah but they're fat, they're horrible, they are, they're all purple at the ankle, not like she's got thin mm.
did he, you do n't pull them if you've got a, a hole in already because that's death.
cos you see like.
that.
not like, like with that one.
there you see I've just cured that one look, that one with.
Mm, ca n't, I dunno.
What?
we'd better go.
Do n't be so nasty.
Er oh decisions, a fishburger please.
Oh Jo.
can have a bit of a party, bit of a rave died and he got to heaven.
Yeah.
Erin, Erin and Brian stuck up again today.
it was really funny.
he called her childish.
so she had a bit of a benny it was.
dead funny.
Brian?
Dunno round here I think.
not Greenlands, maybe Woodrow South so he probably would n't get on too well with someone from.
Well she comes out with such a load of claptrap, she do n't know what she's talking about most of the time ah, are you and dad gon na buy a box each?
Are you gon na buy a box and I'll get rid of the other two to Joanne and Emma?
Cos I might be able to cart them off to Joanne and Emma to give them to their mum's on Mother's Day.
We never buy you anything on Mother's Day, you get a card and be happy with it.
Oh, I want two presents a year for birthday, christmas and children's day.
I've just invented one.
Yes we do, we give you all the love and support you need.
I was talking about you today in English.
Well they were talking about the eleven plus you see.
and they said whose parents took it?
So I went and he er, and she goes er, and did they both pass?
She was expecting me to say yes, I goes no my mum failed.
and er, and, yeah she said but your father liked it did he?
And I goes no he hated it, he used to get detention every day for not wearing his cap he hated it and he did n't do any work.
Cos she was expecting me to trot out something like, yes both my parents went to grammar school like everybody else whose parents went, you know, they were all saying, yes my parents went to grammar school and they got these and these have got these qualifications and everything, I could n't believe it though, there's a load of people in our class and like you know, all the parents are all these things and they're not exactly brilliant, the children.
you know, like Olivia, er, both her parents are teachers and all this business.
er, you know she's not.
she's not much to shout about, you know, intelligence-wise.
mum had failed, but she said why?
I goes well all the, all the questions were matters science and she were n't any good at that.
Would, would, would erm, grandma and granddad let you go anyway?
Would they of let you go if you'd passed?
Well some p, parents did n't like it did they?
Did n't want their children to go to it.
Yeah.
Well, there was two grammar schools in Lincoln though were n't there?
The Lincoln school.
were n't, were n't there a girls?
Were n't there, were n't there another boys and girls one or whatever, or were there just the boys.
and the girls?
Yeah.
Mm.
Where was.
Yeah, where was Christ Hospital then?
Where?
Where the old, where the college is now that art college?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Or was.
Was that co-ed?
Was it boys and girls?
That's a bit unfair.
Girls?
Oh.
Yeah.
Like erm, but, like Miss says some of the stuff on it was so rubbish, I mean like, there was somebody she knew, who their son failed the eleven plus twice and now they've got their P H D.
they failed, but they failed their eleven plus twice.
but now they've got their P H D.
you know, it's so stupid innit?
Assess like that.
Mm.
I mean it might be alright for the more intelligent people or whatever, cos they get the best teachers then do n't they?
But I mean for the other people it's just, it's just rejection innit, you're not good enough.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not algebra oh we had this, we.
Yeah.
That's, that's just like me that is, if I get into a rhythm and someone gives er, I can do it then, but if I just sit on a page, I think oh how do you do that?
Mm, them nice.
Mm mm there was only one in Redditch.
Ulster grammar.
Ulster.
Ulster.
Ulster.
Ulster erm.
No, but it's where all the.
went but you ai n't good enough.
If you were n't, you went to Dudley High.
You ought to try taking some of them, honestly they're so easy the exams are, like history, ah, talk about easy, spartan erm, you could G C S E, P E mum.
You remind me of bit, eh, you're like a bit what Joanne's like, except Joanne's better at maths but she's not very good at English, like when they were doing Animal Farm, I had to explain that it was a parody of the Russian revolution and everything and she just sat there with her mouth open.
Duke of Duke of thingy, it was er on at the Palace it was erm Duke of, there was an advert for it in the paper the other day.
she did n't know it was an opera you see.
Yeah.
and I did n't like to say anything.
Yeah oh.
erm, but, you see, they would of been the most aggravating little gits there, because as soon as they found out, they all started messing about then, for three hours it was on, could you imagine sitting in there with them lot for three hours?
yes, but mum, you're not a teacher at the Leeds High.
If you were it probably be a bit different than it actually is dad said to me once that if he, that if he'd like been in charge of it we'd of gone to the Leeds and not St Augustine's.
Yeah well he's all in with that is n't he?
He's, he's the flipping governor is n't he?
He's one of the governors.
Up there.
Well he's at the Dingleside but he's involved with the P T A there.
and he's bound to bull up his own place is n't he?
I mean no one's gon na say oh yes my school's the best.
What?
It's not, it's no bigger than our school.
No.
It's about the sa, well it's might, just a little bit bigger than our school, about another hundred or something, but that's, that's a drop in the ocean when you've got seven hundred there that's like one in each class or something you know, extra.
No discipline ah, no discipline.
and er, we were like, we was on about, you know like we were talking about the education system and everything in English and you know I told you they were on about people changing at eleven and everyone else in the class wanted the thirteen system except me, it's only cos what they're used to.
but I mean, but like I said, I said, I mean, I went, I went to the like I changed then, I mean to be quite honest I did n't like it, I did n't like it.
no I did n't, I never liked it, whether that was because I knew we were n't gon na be there, or, you know, I just, I was only there six months.
I, you know, I just I would of been alright if it was a bit more organised I do n't.
know it never seemed quite very organised.
Mm.
But you see I was thrown from one teacher all the time Miss all the time.
to, to German, French, Latin.
er, you know proper algebra and all that kind of stuff and it, and it was, I think I would of been better if I had of gone to Our Ladies cos I do n't.
One teacher.
was there?
I know, but.
I know, but that, at St. Hughes you're stuck in a little rut are n't you?
I mean.
You mean we were the eldest for five years there.
Yeah.
That particularly did n't bother me it was the regime, the sudden change in the regime.
you know I think I would of got used to it.
but you know.
What?
No, well you're not thick are you?
what?
Supposedly, when I, when I told Nicola the other day that you reckon that I do n't do enough work, she says cor blimey she was shocked she was, shocked oh do it, do it as near to the microphone as you can mum.
I.
It would n't of been easier.
Not to everybody it would n't.
I'd say they'd got harder, you should see some of the things we do in maths mum, it's not easy.
You know, I mean you, the problem with you and dad is, cos you never got particularly involved with it you do n't, you do n't know exactly what's happening at school, you do n't know what we do.
I know, but, mum that, that was, that was five years ago, I mean I've moved on a great deal since then.
I mean some, some of them are what, what I would deem as fairly easy, I mean I find history easy, but not everyone does.
You know, but I mean, there's no way easy, especially the science and maths equals I times R, voltage and resistance in electricity and magnesium.
what?
but er, that fibbing git Tim right he's got a locker next to me, and he's got velcro on his coat and if I'm standing at my locker and he takes his coat out of, out of his locker, it always flipping pull my tights with the velcro.
that's the third time he's done it, I had such a go at him.
I'll have to I had a bit of major benny actually ha it was rather shocking was n't it?
Not that I ever have major bennies or anything.
I had n't had a benny for a few days actually.
I'm doing well thought I died and gone to heaven I do n't like plain chocolate it's horrible.
take a.
Nothing, sarky remark, on my own just.
Ladylike.
I thought I could give dad some of these and then eat them all myself.
for his birthday.
Do n't you?
Well I'm really shocked mum, I was really going to do it honest.
Eh what you do to me all my.
chuck me in there, chuck me in the closet hit me with your rhythm stick, hit me hard and hit me quick.
What?
What's six o'clock?
it's half six.
That's what it said on his little card.
Nicola did n't believe me when I told her she thought I was playing a joke.
When I told her about this.
I goes er, oh I'm recording it for this thing, she goes oh yeah my beard, ha, I was going I am, ha, but she did n't believe me, can I have some sauce please?
There was definitely no chance of a walk that day, bit of Jayne Eyre there for you.
Oops, that's what I call an honourary delight this is.
What?
Indeed what exciting lessons did you have to do?
Well I had er, oh, what did I have?
Something P E, maths, English and graphics, science, science, maths, English and graphic.
We're having a discussion about erm, whether it should be brought back.
I said definitely not, cos it makes rejects of people in society, therefore a what.
which they all do in my class, cos they're all thick I could n't believe it right.
Oh not all of them, I was sat, I, I was sat there.
and I went who's applying to go on to university or education after eighteen, so I put up my hand, turned round and flipping Stuart and Danny had put their hands up and I just went oh god, they're gon na do really well and Terry, and Terry, we're talking Terry, Terry who has n't got a brain cell to rub together.
so ah that boy, this is the one who said I think we should be allowed to hit girls.
he supposedly, he, two short planks does not describe this boy, even Miss hates him that was it, she, we were having this discussion right in education, she goes, are you cynical about education Terry, he goes, no, he goes, oh she goes why?
He goes I do n't know what cynical means.
I said, ah no and everyone in the class just cracked up sometimes you wonder, you wonder whether he does it on purpose he must do it on purpose, no one can be that thick.
Ninety five per cent.
but erm like Vicky who's got, in her English folder, this is Vicky Vicky, she's got in her literature she's got nine A's and one B and in her other I do n't know what she's got, ten A's probably, mm she's not going to, she wants to be a nurse.
and er, like she said are n't you Vicky and she goes no miss, mm, you ca n't be a nurse till your eighteen.
so like, you know, she's gon na stay on, do A levels and then go into it.
because she might as well have some A levels just in case or whatever, but erm you know I, you know she's, you know, I can understand that actually, she's being quiet sensible about it she said there's nothing else I want to do and I might as well do something that I enjoy, you know, you've only got one life have n't you when it comes down to it?
Mm, like, her dad says to her why do n't you be a doctor and she, but she do n't want to, you know, she wants to be in a hospital and that, she do n't want to end up in general practice.
No, but.
I know, but it wo n't take as long for her to get there as it would if she becomes a doctor.
Mm.
but erm.
Clear up sick, that's a favourite job is n't it?
Yeah, I thought of being that once but I would n't mind it in the wards, but I would n't want to be in the operating theatre, I do n't know why, the blood do n't put me off or anything, but.
Mm.
Yeah.
But like, I mean I do n't mind the blood or whatever, and if they were doing little things, I could handle it, but like, like on that op, operation that woman was having the other day and they cut her open and they just pulled.
and that, that, that's the thing that makes me retch, not the cutting, it's when they just pull it apart.
when it rips ooh, they could of cut it.
No they cut the skin and then they just pulled it apart.
Oh, er.
Ah.
Yeah but what they ripped was all fat, all her fat, ooh.
Oh mine oh, I wish it was David, probably never get.
but, I was listening to myself on that.
Oh is my laugh vile or what and my voice.
it sounds so idiotic.
