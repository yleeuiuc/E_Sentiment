
I'll tell you all about that afterwards, and then you can tell me if you do n't want to.
I'll put it.
away.
And then nobody'll think about it.
I'll.
leave that behind.
Oh!
Hello!
Hello!
Oh yeah.
Ooh ah!
Oh yeah!
Oh!
That's nice!
Oh!
That's.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh yeah.

It was.
That was Christmas Eve.
was n't it?
Here's our lady.
Our resuscitation lady.
Aye, aye.
I have n't put it in.
No!
No!
I have n't put it in.
No.
No.
I did n't know there was one in!
Well it's in our paper then?
Yes, I thought you'd done it now.
Oh I thought they had n't.
You look.
you look like you're in a drunken stupor do n't you?
Must have been green.
Something in green.
Well I said but.
I just hope you're there quick enough!
Yes.
Oh I know.

Oh is that so?
Oh!
Anyway, Mary will have a sense of authority, she's going to.
she may go in his lecture, she'll meet him.
Or like that when they.
how much er.
and er.
Oh yes Mary.
Oh!
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
She understands.
Oh yes, it was at the end was n't it?
Did most of them that is there?
Is this the ones that were?
Yeah!
Her heart stopped.
I mean I.
Yeah.
We th we rang nine nine nine.
they sent er two paramedics.
Erm.
She had erm er.
angina but she takes this spray.
not tablets.
Me I mean she takes it when she's er.
bad.
And she said every time she takes it.
makes her ill.
No.
The father has the same.
and he stopped.
taking it cos it did the same thing.
Cos it makes her so ill!
And th then she was saying well we told her.
to go.
So er.
Well, I was told somebody that there was a lady not feeling very well.
So I went across and she was sitting by the fire exit behind the piano and er, I said what's up?
She said well, I've had my medicine I'm not too good and I feel a bit.
then sh she says I've been.
Having, having looked at her.
and she was beginning to.
hyperventilate.
She was panicking and the more she panicked the more she was.
gasping!
The more she was sucking in, and she says I'm going!
Well fortunately, for me she was n't what I call a big lady.
so I put her on the floor, lifted her feet up to get the blood back to her head.
and she to she took about three minutes before she opened her eyes and came round.
And then sh Elizabeth had come over by then and I said it's it's in her bag, so we had a look at it and her friend said it's for angina, it always makes her ill!
Then we got her up and she said I'm going to be sick so I said do n't worry about it.
But we undid the fire door, which was fortunate we were by it and I said look I'll take you outside the fresh air might revive you.
So Elizabeth was about to get her onto the to carry her out, she said nice and gently and picked her up and taken her outside!
We sat her out on the chair, put her head between her knees and said look, take some big deep breaths and if you're sick do n't worry about it, you'll be alright.
Next thing she says, I feel funny!
Oh I'm going she says!
And the ne that was it!
Just gone!
And she stopped breathing!
And I thought.
Cos.
I laid her on the conc you know, like the, the step out.
at the back we la.
we laid her on the step and I said to Elizabeth she's stopped breathing!
Elizabeth going, stopped, oh oh oh!
She has!
Well er.
we sat there.
well, we started this mouth to mouth and Elizabeth says I'll and I'll put, I said I think her heart's going, but I mean, to me it means anything to get her going.
Anyway, we kept blowing in, and we must have been doing mouth to mouth for about eighteen er about a mi a minute and a half.
She suddenly, Elizabeth there's her one arm after she pressed down on her dress and then she goes, ooh!
That's it, she's going!
We rolled her on the side.
and she, she was very shallow breath.
like oh we talked to her and then we said, do n't worry ambulance is coming.
Just like, she went berserk!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going!
We had to promise she would n't go.
Anyway, when the ambulance men came we made them a cup of tea, cos they said they a they'd have been that busy they have n't had a break!
So we made them a cup of tea and hopefully they were going to talk her into it.
And they said, if she does n't go responsibility that we can accept and then she's had the chance to go.
And she should have gone.
Yeah.
Yeah well.
Well I think more than anything if they'd have seen the state she was in after she'd had this.
drug, they could have probably kept her in, stabilized her on a new one.
and then kept.
her on the new ones.
Well it did on my dad.
This new spray apparently.
does give them.
It's the tri-nitrate, you know.
The glycerine tri- nitrate.
How it affected them.
Yeah?
This spray gives a headache most of time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
I know.
Yeah.
Anthony came through the corridors and say is Elizabeth there and was on.
the floor and said, oh!
And sort of came away much to say thought it was a joke, like.
you know.
Cos we did n't want the four, th the ladies that she was with they knew what was happening but nobody else knew.
No.
Cos a gentlemen who'd come from.
there and Grange, and he's had a bit to drink, he was n't drunk, but.
apparently he's argumentative.
He'd said something to this lady and under normal circumstances he would not a she would n't have said anything.
but.
she did.
And it was upset of answering.
him back.
He argued back with her and.
she just.
panicked!
It was the argument that did it.
It's that little man.
Yeah.
But it were quite.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's what he said!
And somebody's car was actually.
This is the one that that bloke.
and these all came off the same train.
I thought.
this lady was one who was arguing with him as well.
do you know the lady.
that came in the wheelchair but her husband did n't come?
He ca they'd gone to pick them up.
and, he'd got her up and got her ready and sent her out and said he would n't come.
And they were all saying oh but he's always like that!
Well, on reflection, we actually said afterwards perhaps he wanted a day off.
If she was.
in a wheelchair.
and she was well in her seventies!
He probably thought that Christmas day, even if he was n't with her would be a godsend.
if he could have a day's peace.
And I actually spoke to Jenny about it.
and saying, what do you think cos of all the qualified ones at least she cos she worked on the elderly side.
She said, I think, you'd be better off leaving him a if he does n't want to come.
leave him alone.
And.
they would n't let her sit with them because they said oh well, she's she's you know, leave her with them, and it was that little lad.
and the next one that woman that, this one that you.
were saying.
was complaining about him, and about this other woman so I think.
the lad's got.
they never have a good word to say for each other!
Well.
And where she's moved to.
No.
Oh!
So there you are, another saga!
An hour before it she was crying to Theresa.
The one that passed out.
Saying that she'd had.
she does n't like where she's been moved to because of her ill health.
She had.
to move.
She does n't.
like it and she turned round and she says they're not real friends.
And.
Now did you that other woman, a younger woman.
Oh yeah!
She was, she had a pocket full.
of anti-depressant pills.
Valium.
barbiturates.
But she was n't any trouble though.
Yeah!
I hope I never like that!
And she'd had a drink, and a good cry, she'd had.
a good time.
There's her dad?
Your, your husband?
But, but sh.
but you re you re you realize, and I do n't suppose would, that she's a psychiatric patient, to a certain degree.
No, she says your dad keeps trying, er kee when I see your dad down the town and try and.
Well perhaps, perhaps the so and so, so told me.
Yeah well.
Well we did have a letter off erm Good Neighbours through the lady who also came to sing, cos I know her.
of old.
to say you know, to thank us.
been looking forward when I come and.
Erm, yes.
Erm, actually on reflection, having seen the bit of disaster that occurred because erm unfortunately Freda did n't get the phone call until early Christmas day morning off her daughter, to say that instead of them coming up to here to see them that something had happened in London, could they go down to her, so she was prepared to do us a half an hour at half past one and then she was going to drive to London!
I said, I think you better go before you do n't worry about the party.
And that was a sort of a last minute cancellation, and I had to really persuade her to go.
And we realized on reflection, had Freda have not volunteered early enough, another lady who used to work at the station played, u plays for Nigel when he does his gigs.
And she's on her own, and so next year.
they're coming back again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's coming back again thi na na time next year, this year.
And.
they're going to bring Darlene with them.
Well, well it, it.
did even itself out.
Yeah.
It did even itself.
out.
And, I mean, actually on Christmas day we lost about ten people who've been found ill.
I mean one lady was found wandering in the street!
And fortunately, it was, it was one of the councillors, well they phoned that was meant to pick her up, and found her walking the street!
Her husband had been taken into hospital and she was waiting for her son to come and pick her up at half past twelve, this was at half past ten in morning!
Now tha that's the Good Neighbours ' officer.
And she erm well and she sat with him.
fo for about.
half an hour talking to her.
But of course,.
she's trained to do this.
I mean, er kind words.
Yeah.
Well on the whole we've had some.
I've had.


Yes.
And she sat with the.
old dears.
She said I quite enjoyed the singing.
I think there was a lot of atmosphere.
My mother said that.
Yes.
My mother said that.
Yeah.
Only in so much that there was er.
not for dinner, but all the came.
Er, no what happened, my sister came up and brought her two kids in the afternoon.
And then Gloria turned up with her kids in the afternoon.
but they did n't come until three o'clock.
And they knew.
that by coming late they'd have to just take the entertai I mean, except for the monologue.
Well she said you'll be.
Well.
He looked by the way from the most of them, playing up with them at the games and did the up there.
Get them out the way.
Oh she went to him afterwards.
Well no, she finished it.
I think if we ever need to fill in half an hour we know what to do!
She can.
by the microphone then.
Yeah I know.
Well if it is a.
it would have been good!
But.
nobody knew what she sa.
she were talking to herself in the end!
We did n't, I'm, I'm going back to the letter, we did have another one off Tom.
So we've looked at that.
Yeah.
Give him a microphone.
Yeah.
Erm, I mean, he wrote a lot, I saw him church on Sunday and I did thank him for the letter.
and he said well it was the least I could do under the circumstance.
He, he is a gentleman!
He is an old fa.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah, he normally goes to.
Yes!
Mm!
Oh!
Oh!
Mm!
He, he really.
er.
I mean he pla.
he played his violin beautifully!
But it was a bit of a.
behind everybody else but er.
Er i it was.
Nigel.
Nigel got them all up before they even said too much.
Yeah.
No.
He he played his violin, he got up, and actually there was erm the dad, th the mum, she sang with them, is tha was that who it was?
The.
the lady who was singing with them was that.
Victoria, her mum?
She's another so er light operatic singer.
She got up and then when it came round to singing Jerusalem and Edie was put out at not singing Jerusalem, this is another one off the psychiatric list and Pat goes.
so she got up as well.
And he played his violin as well so and actually what Nigel had wanted was to get a little choral group so we.
could all sing.
And then what what was Jimmy offered the day after?
But some ninety twenties song sheets with all the old time.
singers on!
So.
then he said he was getting them copied ready for th.
another year.
But, when Nigel comes next year he'll bring Eileen and I think that under circumstances I think if we say well come for about quarter to two.
Mary would have come and helped at dinner time but she thought that, well it would be alright, you know, and.
we did n't need anyone.
Said if you'd have come early!
That was the lad who sang.
Well, he lives in.
er.
this lady who's secretary.
Yeah.
Yeah, well she used to work at the station in the offices.
I've known her for twenty odd years!
Oh he does.
Pardon?
Why what do you mean?
No.
But, there was a reorganization at Cortilles before you went.
and, they asked us did we want to take over the dinners because.
it was being reorganized and the lady who did it could n't do it any more and would one of us like to take the.
organization on?
And I said well, I'm sorry to say that we're a bit too busy in the.
week to to take it on.
I mean, the same goes when the when they seem to be organizing something that.
runs well it's so easy for other groups to, to try and get you to help them out.
But, if you get involved you end up either taking over.
or not doing what you set out to do.
So it's.
best off not doing any of it.
You've got to choose what you.
No.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
Anyway, is this committee coming to order?
Or is it turning into rabble!
Right.
Is there anything left.
Well I did n't go.
er er.
because er we had a rather an in-depth session at the football on the telly on Monday night.
and there were, I'd got a, a room full of young boys wanting to watch Crewe play Liverpool.
And er I do n't think I was particularly keen of having a house full and I thought.
while th going out leaving them.
I fell asleep.
Er, and I'd forgotten to take the money up before Christmas so it was still here yesterday.
Well she'll be there this Monday.
Yeah.
Aha.
I shall be there this Monday.
What is it?
Oh!
Yes of course.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Er, I've loads.
You know, in fact, they're bigger than that, but the big jar's like a chocolate tin with the red lids on whether you could fill them with bath crystals and some things like that.
Unless you were to put, like to fill, to fill it with a cheap flannel and a bar of soap and a sponge.
Ooh!
Yeah.
Well.
I er, I was just going to bring them up with erm you know about the cheque, cos you got.
did you know about the cheque?
We got a donation given to us.
No.
No.
That never came, that never came to fruition.
In so much that, they were dithering over other things that we think.
er, they were meeting and the lad who was supposed to be at the meeting did n't know what they'd come to decide on.
We'd got to go and pay a bill.
and they needed to know what to pay.
So in the end I had to say I have n't got any more time to chase up after him, but I could always probably come back again later on in the year.
It would have meant.
I would have to pay for it and try him again.
I think Christmas beca cos there was that er you see, they were sorting out.
and I was blue with that with them on one and at this on the other.
and the lad who was dealing with it all, we had some hassle from another quoter.
And then he said, they have n't had their meeting.
He said, how do they what they've said, but they have n't had it?
No, we had a cheque which we presumed had come from Social Services.
and when it arrived it turned out to be a donation from the Lord Mayor's charity.
It had.
been applied for on our behalf so it was n't in fact from Social Services.
And it had been made out to.
the church.
So, in the end rather than send it back and ask for.
it to be rewritten we usually have one event after Christmas that pays for the extra gas and heating that we use.
Er, I know it's twice what we normally pay, cos it was a hundred pound.
But on reflection, a quick little sub-committee meeting at the end of Christmas Day he said well we've paid it now, but we are in fact, in hand.
for the next twelve months.
that we use the hall.
Even though we never asked, I think we still have to make.
sure.
that we're not costing anything.
So, I mean, if anybody.
Yes.
I mean, if anybody asks you to see if it's gone through our books it has n't, but.
having said that it's in lieu of the debt that we would have paid.
But, I then, subsequently met the chappie in charge of Social Services outside the school!
Who said, how did it go?
Blah, blah!
Very nice.
He said there might be some more money coming.
From them this.
time.
But he.
he said this last year.
and it never came.
So I mean, I will continue to harass him through the twelve months if possible, because I think.
And they.
for those who are housebound.
and incapable of driving.
they have to provide it.
for them, you see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're not doing it to compensate Social Services.
we're doing it.
to provide a day for the people who.
come.
But, at the same time it does take the burden off them.
Course they would!
Yeah.
So, I will carry on.
But, at the moment, there's enough in there to pay off what debt we've got left.
For the puddings.
And there's a few coppers left over.
Yeah.
Well, in the bank's four hundred and forty seven.
So, we are well in hand.
Erm we went up as high as er eight hundred forty one erm.
About er I keep saying we need somebody to keep account book.
About.
six hundred pound.
About five to six hundred.
pounds.
Bearing in mind that this year we got a lot more, I mean, we we got all those crackers and blowers from the hotel.
Er, I have n't sent him a letter back yet cos I thought, wondered whether anybody'd like to volunteer to write, I sent a card last year.
The Borough.
They sent.
one hundred and fifty crackers and a tub of at least a hundred blowers!
No, the co the cost of that alone.
those boxes of crackers are about I think they're about fifteen pound a box and the three.
boxes.
But.
Well there's fifty in each one.
I think there are ah, no!
No!
No!
No, they're nine pound.
Cos I know when I went to the warehouse.
erm when I went the first year I looked at them.
Do you remember when I bought the wrapping paper.
and they were up there then.
And I looked at them and I thought well it's a lot of money to pay out, we'll see what comes in.
Erm and on, on reflection.
I er I did n't buy them and he sent us three boxes and they came from the same warehouse.
Course they cost a lot.
Do n't ask me his name because it's Italian!
The Villa Arms.
Yeah.
A hundred and fifty crackers.
and a box of blowers.
Well they were, because.
things like that, and we also, I think this year we ought to send Sid one because he came up with ten litres of five each of them boxes so came up with ten litres of wine.
I know.
But.
I think, I think to have made.
effort, that's to the.
Well, it might put the cat among the pigeons June, but then so what!
It needs revitalizing!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Bit difficult.
Yeah.
It's at the Crick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just do a duplicate copy of the letter.
And also, I think, to add.
He's the commissions manager.
Well I think if you were to send it to.
the manager, care of, Mr Arthur.
If we send it to the manager, care of Mr Arthur.
Oh is it?
A card.
Have you got one?
Right.
How did she go on.
at does anybody know how she went on at her dance New Year's Eve?
Did she go?
Cos she, I heard her voice.
Oh!
That.
Well, why I'm asking.
I saw her on the way to the doctors and she'd thought she'd got chicken pox.
I said, I bet you're allergic to something.
Oh nothing.
Sandra, I've been with somebody with chicken pox.
cos she said if I ca n't go do you want two tickets?
I said, well I'll find somebody but I hope you have n't got chicken pox.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh was there?
Oh!
Up there in the home.
No.
It was lovely!
Mhm.
Oh that's nice.
Yes, yeah, and Julie went down.
and saw.
them.
Yeah.
Ah ah!
No!
Mm mm.
Tt!
Oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
unfortunately.
I, I mean there were two plates.
of salmon sandwiches.
and we've, I mean we've said this on reflection afterwards, as much as we do n't like cutting up plates of sandwiches there must have been some that took home half a dozen.
salmon, and there were some.
that never saw a salmon.
I.
No.
My father never saw a.
Cos she'd burn more.
Old fashioned trifle.
They always say the thought might be worse and to, we know it costs about, it costs about ten pound to buy well, I think at the end of the day worth it, is to put them out on a paper plate.
Simply.
not to save the washing up but to stop the arguments.
that came!
As to who'd got what.
And if they did n't want it then, they had a plastic bag they.
could have just put their plates in and taken.
it home.
As it was, I mean I found another chocolate gateau under those Christmas tree cakes.
And somebody said, we have n't had any cake!
And I went, I know everybody had a piece of this chocolate on their plates, but there was nothing else I could do, once they saw it that was it.
I never got to the end of the table.
And there are.
there were sixteen portions.
and they sell at fifty four pence.
a slice.
You know.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can say if.
if, if, if it had been proportioned.
out that, they had one salmon, one cheese, one ham.
with a couple of cakes and one of these.
Christmas tree, a bit of.
and given them a dish of trifle I think a lot would have just eaten the trifle, had a cup of tea and taken the rest home.
As it was.
they were seeing how much more they could eat and take home.
And if they knew it had all been.
divided and gone out there would n't have been a.
problem.
We, we actually wrote to the manufacturers of paper plates.
the first year and the most you get out of them is they do n't even bother to come and see you in the corridor do, who went down?
Somebody went there.
Yes.
Stood outside and I'd been rung up.
rung up and th.
many times, not only for this group but for another one.
And they do n't even answer.
And we lost our contact did n't we?
Although I, we was n't surprised by them.
suddenly erm.
Yeah.
Well.
Well it, it, it caused a lot of aggravation to some.
that.
particularly those in wheelchairs that could n't fight their way to another table.
The women that erm, I must admit though that.
The er.
the dinner organization was better cos we did manage to get seconds out to those that wanted it.
And, there was n't one complaint about the turkey.
Not one.
Oh well I'll get.

But, the breasts were the same price.
and to make up the weight instead of five he sent six to make the weight up.
We only needed five.
Bearing in mind, you only needed four though and knew they had n't of come cos well.
having said that.
they were n't wasted cos you went.
They had a slice of ham.
and a slice of turkey.
Yeah.
Er erm I think, I mean they all eat most of them eat the ham, there were a few that sent it back I think it was probably a bit much for them.
But er.
Two.
two electric.
Do you?
Anyway.
Margaret wants to say something.
Let's listen to her.
You di, straight o I'll demonstrate.
Give me these here.
No, you put that to, turn that to a different colour.
What you did, you went into the middle and out again.
You've got to go to the middle and straight across.
But then, if there's another one there.
because your draughts are like this.
I had a, that's a straight line because then when you get to there you put another straight line across another jump!
You've gone a straight across there.
A straight line.
What you had done.
You did!
You did that all the way down that line when you started did n't you?
Because what you did, you went over to the top of it in a sense, and then straight at an angle to it.
You've to go straight across.
When you did it this way you go straight across, straight across, strai, but yo your second jumps you were doing you were going there like that instead of going straight across.
I went across yours like that.
Yes!
But yo, not the way you did it over here.
No because you di, you made two, you made two mi, what you did on this one over here you moved into a space first and then jumped.
That was your move.
You did.
that, and then jumped.
Well that was your move into the space.
Was n't!
It's your go.
Never mind trying to block me off!
Ian's not far enough across the board to do anything to me.
What you doing?
Mm?
Are you playing at er, a cheating game you two?
Mm?
And he goes backwards?
You see you're, yo, make sure you're going backwards but he'll keep going forwards so I would n't listen to him Ian otherwise you'll end up losing.
Yeah!
That'll do.
there.
It's your go Ian.
Yeah.
Ignore me!
Well I must admit I I was bought, my sister saw them in er.
It's a little box and in the lid was a recess.
with a little plastic fork and spoon.
And they were fifty pence.
And I bought a couple but the kids have taken them to school.
They take a cold meal.
But.
No, cold meals!
So I bought two.
they're not quite big enough for putting Matthew's in separate.
You know, I ca n't him enough.
So I've put myself er salad and cottage cheese.
Erm, and our John he did take but he does n't like it when it goes.
So he's back on just er but, I have another box at home and it's, it's a round box with.
four.
, yeah.
Well what I do with Matthew is, I put him the lettuce and tomato and celery in one portion he has er, cottage cheese and coleslaw in the other and.
and then whatever he's got some corned in another one.
And I put cling film on the top so I forgot.
And then, the other one I add a cut of erm chocolate teacake or something.
La, like I've done today I've made him another jelly in it.
Yeah.
Where's the?
Well I'm off next week, Thursday we got an extra four packets at the time.
The oth, it's the other ones we've.
Er.
Julie.
Julie with the blond, er dark hair and she does n't like Sonia.
And she sits on the opposite to us last year.
Any time, any time at all I'll get you off.
I says, are you in Thursdays?
And she said no!
She says she's in Tuesdays for one sodding hour!
I said that's exactly what I have Thursday.
I said nothing you can to change it because of the way the system works.
If I changed it they'd probably convenient.
And she she's primary ed so she's no good to Jean either.
I'll, I'll ask this other girl who I do n't know so well but I'm sure if she's going that way, she, you know, she's in that area anyway.
Yeah.
Oh it's Paula?
No, it's Mandy.
Doing education and But as I say, it's just a case of asking though.
It's nothing you, you know even if you only can manage for a few weeks.
I used to find in Newcastle College, I mean I was wa walk back and people used to stop and.
Have n't you met me?
I am.
Can I get up this one?
Oh yeah.
Might as well.
go up there.
I do n't know who put it in you know.
It's not a member of the committee.
We did actually have er, it's a, I think what it might be we had a lady who came to brought her son, mind, her son's thirty odd and they did the singing for us.
And er she's the secretary for the Good Neighbour there was another man there from the, from the Good Neighbour who does like, the articles or the advertising, and I think probably it's got to be her.
I'm never really saw it.
And Joan said she must have been depressed.
If you'd said the right things at.
the right place.
Yeah.
I must.
admit I am.
going to miss that Jane.
Er, have you been to Biology?
Go, you sorted your.
cos I went last night.
That's right, yeah.
Is that a ca, is it a.
or a departmental.
Well, we put all of that we've not any offers anyway!
You got ta consider them.
Still, we're having a cat!
Oh you're erm magazines at the top there.
Er, when you've finished with it, all I want is the token off the corner of the page it happens to be on the reverse side.
of the first page.
I'm not saying we're going to collect the tokens, but just in case our John says mum!
You know?
Oh this erm it's the currency of the world.
Yeah.
Well, of course, we do have The Times dear!
I have never known so many articles on Russian!
This is on the black market Russian.
Oh yes.
What did she do to the market?
That's what this is, Mrs.
Bolcek Bolcek.
She will actually,.
Yeah.
She felt that the education of the Boars was n't me, er the basics to get some education for them.
I thought that she gave them education to add to er, to the poor.
And cos she always, she brought.
er she brought a, a lot of Western artifacts in it, she brought Western civilization.
had been taught.
Ah, well yes, I suppose.
what I mean is er.
I wa, I know when I.
when I looked at the front page and he said about two paragraphs.
I thought you'll be lucky!

She just put that.
Is that the right word?
She did n't like Thurston.
did she?
I sat there and thought what did this woman abolish?
I th, you know when you're sitting there and ca n't click your brain into gear?
Mm.
No.
I can probably go sometime this morning.
You got something to drop off?
Yeah.
You want me to, it took me, it took me an hour and it'll finish it.
You should have asked, you mean by Friday do n't you?
Erm, you know the parent's, you know parent psychology.
er, psychology are you only in Thursday same as me two till three.
Oh!
You're in for four lectures are n't you?
Will you get a lift back?
You'll miss this one!
Oh you do n't go back?
Oh we're not, we do n't need to take it till the next one.
What's that for?
Ah!
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm.
Erm I'd seen one this morning but she is n't in the core lecture so she's no good to you, but I said to her could you give me a lift at all?
You know, at any time during the week?
She said, any time at all if we're at the same time.
I said, you in Thursday?
She said no.
But I do kno, I know another girl, I do n't know her well, but she does do core lectures.
Well I'll find out what she's doing.
Yeah.
But.
Joan's just said she thinks she knows someone that's in core lectures that comes up from our way.
Well we hope that we might.
sort of, see her.
probably, twelve-ish and.
Yeah.
We'll be in the corridor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tarrah!
I've got a couple of erm, really going to be specific to do essay writing, but I need to get in the subjects in.
But I've got plenty to read up o, I've read my criminology.
I want to read my physics also.
So that's more than enough for this morning!
And I've got a chapter to read for American Studies.
No, if if you fail this coming back after Christmas I did n't actually.
Left their lights on.
Someone's going to have a flat battery!
Ha, ha, ha!
I've got to go and tell the teacher this morning Alex needs to stay till twenty past three cos they only want them to stay till half two.
But there's nothing I can do, it's very inconvenient I know.
alright.
And we've been waylaid on.
the way back by another mother.
And then I better go and see Annette to tell her.
To straighten it up.
Yes.
Erm Rob and Polly's mum's picking Simon up and taking him home and erm, Annette's picking up most nights Gary's gon na be home just after four so it's actually someone to take them home.
But tonight, he's got his first staff meeting till half five so tonight there's extra.
board?
Do you know what I thought?
Yeah.
Why.
do n't we get a great big saucepan lid he can give them bill?
Right.
Mm.
I know.
I'm going to.
how do we get the, I'm absolutely.
exhausted!
I'm gon na to go.
Well how many, how much is wrong?
Where would you go?
I think we could do with doing like we said and asking St. Edwards if they've any.
Yeah, it is, it is n't closing.
No, well not yet, they're hoping for a takeover bid.
Well when I say, they're certain, a big one.
Like one of those great big ones.
that you use in the school.
Oh!
They want to try and get her home instead of going in a school.
Yes.
And, it's we like.
we said it's easier for us than to keep borrowing Eileen's every year.
Because, if we start building up.
We're building up the crockery.
Because we, even if we ever came to a final close if.
we ever had to.
Well we do n't know, but I've tried the education authority, they have n't got any in stores at the moment.
And I wondered about Chedderton.
St. Andrews.
St. Andrew's Place.
Well I'll start at Old Street.
The County Caterers.
I think it is.
They're very expensive though!
I was, you see, when the Head was closing.
Teddleton whether they would have any.
But I.
I tried ringing them and I did n't get any answer on the phone.
you see, so I did n't try again, but maybe tomorrow if I think about it.
in the morning I'll try it again.
It's not, it's St. Andrews.
Place.
It's just a shop right at George Street.
Coming up from the baths.
Go past.
And it's set back like that on the crossroads.
Yeah.

Yeah.
But we have n't actually had a set amou, although they said that there would be money coming.
nothing came out of the last committee meeting to a definite, this is definite this.
See we bro, we bought, we bought six turkey tins.
rather than keep using the big tins for the school.
I mean, they're ninety nine pence a tin and turkey tins stowed for years so I do n't think these are gon na come to any harm over.
the next five or ten.
years.
They'll have paid for themselves.
Er, we well I thought.
I've got one.
Not large catering ones, I have n't.

Well we do have a contact at a hotel.

We have a contact in a large hotel in the town.
It might be worth asking might n't it?
Yes!
No.
No.
No.
See apparently education now, we're on a such a cut back that they've.
recycled them so much by the time we get back to school they've had it!
Yeah.
But bearing in mind we use four of the big ones.
right, so for starters, one is n't any good.
Wo, I mean one is a start but erm, in that I may as well still got a half a dozen off the school.
They're bound to be at least sixty, to eighty pounds a pan I would think, if not.
I bet you you're not going to be far short of at least that much per pan.
I mean an ordinary.
strong saucepan.
ordinary household now, you're looking at thirty pound!
, now I mean it, I mean.
No.
No.
Er, providing.
but you see being catering, they come heavier and thicker.
anyway because of.
the amount of time that they're the stove.
I might.
Yeah.
Mm.
Except.
with the crusty tart.
And the raffle.
They're not prepared to settle for sarnies and a cake on the side.
And unfortunately.
we have one.
lady who does n't eat it but brings the bowl.
Yes, we take the meat pie home in a plastic bag!
What?
Er so I mean, we're, we're, we'll say.
we really need to start.
No!
I wonder if I could get them through the education.
Who said.
Well, I mean,.
Well mention it in passing.
and then if not, I will have a word with the contact here, the contact for the.
hotel wear.
You see, and we, we remember last time we did something, we'd go down into a or scout movement where.
they have large pans, but even they were looking for some large pans!
So.
they want using when they're here otherwise it's pointless, it's like pots.
and pans, th th the crockery.
if it's here it's not much point leaving it for once a year.
It, it's got.
to be used otherwise.
it's waste of space.
But er the pans would be the same.
If we.
do get them, if.
they go in stock.
as long as erm there's space found there for them.
The trouble is, we're bringing so much stuff in it's just the amount of space!
Well I think.
True!
Oh!
Yeah.
I've, I've got one.
but I've got nobody to go with!
Well I refu, I I mean Henry wo n't come out.
and I bought one so, I said to him I ca n't afford.
four pounds for a dance if I'm not coming.
but I do n't mind two pounds for a race night.
Yeah, cos I bought a ticket.
yeah.
I've got twenty pounds at home.
Has she got the twe, she's know how much.
to give me?
Oh right!
Yeah.
Well you'll have to come in on the way ho.
mind.
you.
I did say I was n't staying.
I better go!
Er, well it's not so much that, I keep looking at the clock and then we'll he'll be, he'll.
thinking that you and he's got to.
put his.
Pat.
Oh where's my racquet gone?
Where have I put it?
Right.
Come on then.
I can play with Gerry can I?
the colleges?
I do n't know, now.
The one.
Mm.
Must have come from Keele does n't she?
Oh!
Oh yeah.

When's he placing the order?
Who's he placing the order with?
Mm.
Right.
Will it still be this room or will.
it be a different room?
Oh!
Yeah.
Oh right.
Thank you.

Mm.
Mine has n't.
Oh!
Have you got mi, do you want me to do it again anyway?
Cos mine is n't altered.
I know, well mine.
Do it again?
Yeah.
Oh of course, yes!
Tutor.
Oh that's a quarter.
I have n't bothered to put myself down for tutorial or shall.
do it?
And the, the core topic at the bottom is only two weeks so.
Yeah.
The education for the afternoons starts in.
Yeah, it's a Friday, and then another Friday but just the other ones.
that's it, yeah.
No, well that.
Yeah.
I think, I I'm positive it finishes by the end of term.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
I ca n't re, I I ca n't remember when we exactly started, I've got quite a lot this term.
Put it in your book or your folder there.
Oh I.
Having got.
What's it meant to be?
I do n't think I've got that one.
I've put it, oh I've put it.
that goes to the summer does n't it?
Cos the education will then come on to Thursday, Friday is n't it?
After Easter.
No.
No.
But it comes.
onto Thursday and Fridays.
Yeah.
But do n't know.
Yeah!
If if it's go, well yo, we do n't know because they do n't, they have n't put out exactly when it is, whether it.
No, second years.
No.
Wo n't be, it expands.
in the summer and they take over two more.
It must be the heat that does it!
Yeah.
And we only know that if it goes on for Monday afternoons for an hour, instead of.
being an hour it's going onto two hours.
and it's going to be afternoons.
But apparently it will go on into the being Fridays, but.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh!





No.
Yes.
Would she go to criminol, does she do criminology?

Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Do you have a choice on that or is it compulsory all questions?
Is it a compulsory set of questions on or do we have a choice?
You just said.
Yeah but.
Two from each?
In three hours is it?
That's some doing!

Trouble is, how legible.
do you want it!

of the overall paper.
And erm I always think it's a bit funny about pass marks because I do n't think you know, this is worth fifty percent and then I think what's a, now what's the pass mer mark?
And I tend to think now, does this, is this work a pass?
And.
they, if, I mean, if the pass mark is ninety percent and I've already decided it's worth a pass then I give it ninety percent you see!
Mm.
marking, yeah.
Just as if it's!
Did many people fail last year?
Mm.
Jus.
Yes, I was just saying what was your pa, did.
many people fail?

Does that go for all subsid if you fail your subsid you can retake?
Oh!?
Oh!


Mm mm.
Brilliant!
Oh!
She was lovely!
Yeah.
Mm mm.
I think.
she's so.
vivacious about it!
Enthusiastic!
Mm.
She actually made it interesting, because I think you think, oh dear, gypsies!
But yo you could n't help but take things in.
That, yeah.
Yeah.
She did, by the way, give us next week's as well, so you do n't have to.
put next week's up.
Mm.
You feel sympathetic to how.
we've been.
all term!
Because this is how we've.
on every subject!
Finding them.
Yeah!
And I was looking out through the door and you have n't got five minutes longer.

Aha.
Mm.
He'll probably sa.
ask.
Photostat.
Mm.
They've got very definite ideas about their size and outstanding.
Mm.
Mm.
I often wonder you know, whether they do n't like your money cos you'd amazed at however much wealth they possess, but if you do get inside it's amazing the collection that they that they round here, they used to collect red glass, and er Spode.
and they used to be caravan down on Lyme by the park and.
standing outside.
it was no different than anything else, but the minute you got inside.
one vase on the ledge would be two, three thousand pounds worth of red glass!
Unbelievable!
Th, that is a big family round here is n't it.
the gypsies?
There's a family at Stafford as well, they live on part of it and they actually bought a field off I do n't know if you know the bypass at Stafford, the.
site?
And there's a field there, and there's nothing, a couple of ponies in it and a caravan and when one of those died is it last year, or the year before there was one of the biggest funerals ever seen!
And they came from abroad and they had a.
big wake round here for the.
the family.
Mm.
Very!

Did you see that evening about the others what, the so- called Tinkers.
Those that are n't true Gypsy or Romany.
just the, just those that tag round because they've.
nowhere else to live and.
they frustrate them.

Mm.
Oh right!
Not uncalled for.
though in many er.
not uncalled for though in many respects.
They'll manipulate the situation.
Mm.
Cos the true gypsies, the true Romany wandering gypsies tend not to settle.
in that sense, and.
do n't actually make the sort of mess that, what we call gypsies, the tinkers, when they're.
just the travellers.
But those are not, I do n't think those are the true gypsies.
Those are what we call Tinkers and the Irish call the Diddicois and the wanderers.
those are the ones that going away tend to leave.
It, it's.
Mm.
Mm.

Mm.
Who finances this sort of?
Who finances it?
Mm.
Yeah.

You'd probably the D H S S.
then!
Yeah I know.
Oh!
Mm.

I wonder they view erm?
The green knight?
Was he just called the green night or did.
he have a name?
Mm.
Chopped off my head.
That's the story I was thinking you were doing it today erm it's called the green knight, but he has a name does n't he?
And he gives them er, a magic.
He gives three things that'll help him.
I tho, is n't one a magic belt or something?
Oh!
Oh I bet you timed that for tea time!
It's tea time just.
Well I'm going out later.
Yes.
Alright then.
Okay.
Hang on.
Well I'm going out too.
Well I, he'll go back and find another door er, er back up to where he lives.
Have you?
Thanks a lot!
You always seem to want a curry.
Dad did!
So what happened to the green giant in the end?
The green knight.
He did initially, and I said him back.
No, I did n't get that far.
No, he only got this far.
No I do n't want.
to!
I'm having my tea!
I'm not surprised because every time.
Every time.
you come in, a listen!
It was across the before I could shout and say come back.
Back door.
It do n't matter!
Well I'm sorry but.
Do n't you worry about it!
He's walked across as far as this middle door.
Ye, I know!
Will I have to swear!
Beans!
Come on!
Er I'll pick them out.
Well I'm sure he does n't go on his own a, with shoes on like that!
I do n't care!
I do n't think, I shou, I shouted here.
About here?
He got up to as far as the doorway, but I do n't think any further.
Then as far as, no.
love.
Just got as far as the door.
Oh!
What a good boy!
Yeah.
Well.
they might be still in here.
Pardon!
Come and have your tea first Hary.
No.
They're not, so, I do n't know what you've got papers with this for?
Yeah, well I do n't know, that's what I said, I do n't know why you've got.
it.
No, it's not been found before.
You should n't ask Jonathan.
Jonathan could n't persuade him.
Jonathan!
At mother's, you know?
David.
Did you?
Oh!
What did you do with the dog then?
Are you feeding him on?
Oh!
I bet you've studied about every pile of dog muck!
No.
Seen the headlines here?
Asda's sixty five million pound losses.
Asda.
Three hundred and fifty redundancies at head office.
Twenty million written off for launch of the new distribution system.
Mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm!
Seen this?
Brian created a piece of history when he invited his former teacher to a special church service.
V I P guest was Roman Catholic leader Cardinal Basil Hume.
No.
His name John.
Sheriff.
Staffordshire.
Former pupil at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire.
Where Cardinal Hume was his housemaster.
And he was appointed the county's high sheriff, he decided to invite his ex-teacher to attend the traditional church service to mark the opening of high court session.
The service at St. Mary's.
and the tenth centre was attended by civic dignitaries.
It's the church that's in in the middle of the shopping you know, it's got all the grass round it.
Well tha, that's the county chur, that's the town of the like St. Giles is here, is the town's church well St. Mary's is the town's, o all the se service is to do with civic dignit, dignitaries and to mark the opening of courts is always held at St. Mary's.
They said it's, he is the first Cardinal for hundreds of years to visit St. Mary's.
Mm!
Do want some more?
Well it wo n't because it's gone cold!
Let me, give it two minutes in the microwave.
Co co cold!
Some sauce here if you want it.
I do n't even know whether they let them off at the head office.
No you do n't!
He'll come back in a minute.
I'll pull them up when he comes back.
Comet are opening at Festival Park.
Well!
Well see!
I ca n't see them keeping two stores on.
But they're looking for more erm sales staff!
See in here.
Full time and part time, seven days a week.
So they're gon na take you on now on the basis that you work seven days a week.
Comet!
Says full time and part-time seven days a week.
Sales assistant, part-time.
Part-time job that offers the flexibility you've been looking for.
Day's, evening, or weekends.
It says, or weekends, so I wonder whether they'll stick to er giving you the chance of not working.
Well if they take you on on the basis that you do n't have to work Sundays, they ca n't change the regulations when you're working.
But.
one wonders whether you're forced into signing, that if needed, you'll.
work.
Mm mm.
What letter?
Ye oh yeah!
Yeah.
It's in the kitchen cupboard.
It's in the kitchen cupboard.
She sounds as if they're back together again even.
She Sellotaped it back on.
I would have thought they'd have been in touch about extending the guarantee through you.
You'll wear it out!
You will try.
Four fifty.
T T F A.
Mm mm.
That was where the phone call was from.
The woman that's the secretary.
Although I I do n't exactly belong to it any more, but I said I'd go down.
They wanted some in, well she was after information.
Cos she did n't realise I'd be going down.
I do n't think he got that far.
I shouted i.
I was busy on the.
phone and I undid the door.
and I turned round and shouted.
You seen what's on tonight?
Nine o'clock.
Repeated.
Powerful drama about the political turmoil in Ireland during the twenties when the British Prime Minister Lloyd George met with Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera leaders of Sinn Fein.
No?
It's on till ten and then it's on after the news, for another hour.
It's on for two hours.
Oh!
I bought you a leaflet.
About what?
Just said I met him.
I only said hello to him.
I told you, I was it was only the man who looks after the buildings.
He's like a porter, caretaker.
He knows who's coming, who's going and who's due to use the place.
He happened to come in on.
Oh yeah!
Co th we go in there and sit and study because they've got a kettle and coffee and tea, just help yourself when you cup of tea.
Take some coffee up, or tea up and leave it there and in payment for the drinks that you've had.
He lives somewhere up at Keele but.
I do n't know whether he lives on campus or in the village.
I think it's in the village.
Oh yes!
Permanent.
I do n't think it's every day though actually in the chapel, I think it's down at where he lives.
But I think it's where he lives.
Not, not there is a side chapel there, the east chapel and that's the catholic chapel but it's also used by the non- catholic group.
And they have united services and then split part way through.
They have a lot of united services, and then when it comes to communion they segregate and then join again.
But I do know that he, where he lives, I'm sure I've seen it written that where he lives he has services there.
Does n't give his address, it just gives his phone number.
But that's what you check.
Well when it does ste, it, you can fill that in and send it to them and then they phone.
And you can sort of join in the the church group.
And it sort of lets them know who you belong to.
That's the people who I would think more probable for those who are living on campus.
No, because I have a parish of my own.
Well i.
I, he he said that but I.
Yeah.
It's no for if you're going to be there all the time, that they know where you are and where they can contact you.
Well.
Well the.
last time I.
Oh, the other chappie who was there, he knows.
Actually, he, he knows that Paul the bloke who looks after the place he goes to St. Andrews.
And er.
And he ac.
he actually told, said to him when he came in, he said, oh he is one of your flock!
So he came in and he he said this is Father and I said, oh are you better?
And he looked, I said well I knew you'd been ill.
And I I explained, like, I said where I lived like, and he said ooh I stayed there convalescing at.
I said yes I know you did.
Erm and I just said, I said I used to housekeep there and at Nutton Oh!
Did you?
And I sa, I was telling him, I said, cos I fo, I'm sure he I'm sure he met Father Tom.
No, they used to meet up.
Because actually the village of Keele would be under Nutton It's only the University that he's got under his chaplaincy.
The village would come under Nutton.
So they cross paths slightly.
in that sense.
So they had met up.
Oh yes!
It it would all come.
under the er.
the area.
But I mean if you count how many people were there when I went to mass when it was a holy day.
Erm how many thousands are up there, and of those thousands, how many mu, how many hundreds must be Catholic?
Well I do n't know.
Actually who stayed for mass there was only about thirty.
Yeah.
They have their own choral society the Catholic church, and the Anglican church do.
But you got a chaplain, the erm the chaplaincy of Keele, so it's like a united one, they have their own choir, but the kee, the catholic one also have theirs.
A, oh dear!
About he's, I would say he's in his mid-sixties.
Possibly slightly older.
They in there?
It's when they broke into er near.
Between the day after New Year and Sunday stole a video recorder.
Mm!
What?
No.
They've got er a deal with Toyota for producing er parts.
Darling!
Ah!
What do you mean next year?
We've only just started this year!
What?
You ca n't have it!
Well, you've just said a word, it costs three hundred pounds!
His did n't cost that much!
I'm not telling you!
But it did n't cost that much.
Well I suggest that between now and the next er Christmas er, day you decide.
to er.
Well you'll just have to wait and see!
You think it's Christmas every day!
Yeah, well.
Alex.
Will you come and set the table for me.
See the knives and forks there.
He said ner ner?
What does that mean?
erm I think it means yes mother dear.
I thought he did.
Right then.
No I should leave that there so you do n't get burnt.
Yes?
Well has that one not been on the floor?
Well just wipe it, it does n't matter, just wipe it on this towel.
Wipe it on this towel.
There you go.
my place I do n't mind put it in my place.
No, now go and put it my place, that's alright, now off you go.
I expect I'll survive it somehow.
Okay boys, dinner's done.
Do you want gravy?
Do you want gravy?
It's gravy based on chicken.
It's the normal one that we have but it's a bit thinner.
Can you manage?
Give Alex a piece of bread.
Erm.
A bit more what?
fingers.
Do you want some more gravy?
On your carrots?
There you go then.
There you go then Simon's gon na bring you some bread and then you can dip it up.
What did they use to say at Pontins?
Oompah oompah stick it up your jumper?
Yeah.
What was the other thing?
No I ca n't remember either.
Have you got some bread for Alex?
No, that's what they sing.
There you go, there's your bread.
Goodness you're eating that fast int you?
No that's a piece, that's a sandwich piece, watch that programme?
Mm.
And kick everybody?
Oh tick everybody.
Can you move your feet?
People run around you and past you do they?
And then you can get changed back to normal?
But till everybody, does that, does it carry on like that until everybody's.
turned into an octopus?
And what else do you play?
Yeah?
Instead.
And who was there, was Daniel there?
And Jesse?
And Rachel.
And you.
Was some, did you say there's some boys from your school gone?
Who's that?
What's his name?
No, we know Jesse.
And who runs it?
Who's in charge?
No.
Was it a friend of Barbara's?
Is it a lady that's, ar are there ladies that are n't an are n't friends of Barbara's?
Most of them are n't they?
And did you find out what you do next week?
Oh.
Could always ask then you'd know.
And what time are you going to the pantomime tomorrow?
Do you know?
Oh right.?
Well you were going to take a satsuma and some Quavers were n't you?
We have n't got a satsuma, what about a pear, packet of Quavers and a pear?
Do you like pears or.
find a packet of Quavers somewhere there.
No they wo n't let you go, you'll be able to go next year with your school.
You know when you, you only just started your school did n't you after Christmas?
Well they'd already been to the pantomime at your school so you'll have to wait till next year now.
You'll be a bit bigger then.
Er yeah, pantomime's usually are like that.
If you go to the New Vic you'll find a pantomime probably sticks, really sticks to a traditional story.
And they do n't shout things like oh yes you are and oh you're not and oh yes you have and oh no you have n't.
But this'll be do you remember the one we went to the other day?
They sometimes say rude things and that do n't they?
And then somebody'll sing some song that's completely unrelated to it.
What were they singing? dee dum, dee dum dee dum dee dum.
glowing colours he made their tiny wings.
Good job you have a hymn book.
would you?
Well daddy was to have been with us for this was n't he, for this meal?
Have you?
Does it say School Praise on it?
That's cos children have them.
No, wh what's wrong with them?
Why has n't he covered it?
Did n't he cover it at home?
You used to take them home and cover them do n't you?
Is yours covered?
Oh right.
are the stuff with the papers going on put paper on some did n't we?
And what sort of things did you do at school?
Who's that banging?
What things did you do at school today?
Yeah.
What did you have for dinner?
Mm.
You're beginning to look like a sausage.
Smiles like a sausage, looks like a sausage.
my God he is a sausage.
What else did you have with your sausage?
Did you have potatoes?
You did n't did you?
No what?
What?
I do n't believe that.
I do n't think Mr.
No, I do n't think Mr would want you just to have sausages.
I'm not paying eighty five pence a day for you to eat sausages.
What did you have then?
It is eighty five pence a day, yours is ninety pence so you'd better be even wiser with your choice.
Incidentally what have you had for dinner?
That's because you're.
Not those cheese and potato things?
Oh something different was it?
I think you could probably eat that sausage.
Or are you, are you satiated with sausages?
I bet the sausages see you coming oh no here's Alex, quick then, hide.
Can I talk posh?
What for?
Like, what like how?
That's not how you talk posh is it?
Do you mean.
Stop kicking.
Stop kicking.
I talk posh.
Like Mrs Th le let's hear somebody do Mrs Thatcher then.
Impression of Mrs.
Just a minute.
Go on.
Now okay let's have Prince Charles.
at school.
And what's that like?
Which one's Christopher Watkins?
The one that looks like a problem school boy.
with a knife?
Can you talk common like cockneys talk?
No it's, I mean I'm not very good at this cor blimey up the apples and pears.
You have n't eaten your sausage.
Er well I left the stuffing cos I, I did n't think I'd left it in long enough, I put it in a bit late and I thought we'd leave the stuffing.
Have some stuffing next day.
Have you had enough to eat now?
Are you nearly ready for bed then?
Good.
Have you shown Simon your picture that you've done at school?
He's done a picture of a man with hair.
He's done a picture of a man monster.
Oh just a monster.
It's got hair, eyes, nose and mouth and it's got a big yellow sun, has n't it, shining over and it's the bestest picture you've ever seen since you last went to the art gallery.
Remember that one, that Picasso?
Well it's much better than that, and this is something taken from one perspective int it?
a man, that big is n't he?
Mm I suppose so, yeah.
manage to eat that chicken.
Chicken will make you grow into a big strong boy.
Chicken.
You do n't eat it.
Chicken, if you eat chicken it makes you grow strong cos it's got protein in, if you it makes you.
it makes.
so that your bones will grow.
What would happen if you did n't drink enough milk and you did n't get enough calcium and your bones did n't grow but you kept eating lots of protein?
Well you would n't be able to grow any.
taller but you'd kind of grow out.
A midget?
Well a sort of small, fat person probably.
But you could n't get any either.
A mutant.
Fifteen.
No.
Seven, twenty.
seven threes are?
Correct.
Go on then, off you go.
Have a look.
If twenty one's there then it's right is n't it?
Yeah join it up to the sum answers.
Cos seven threes are?
Twenty one.
You could do the arrow going from the figures to the answer, from the sum to the answer not from the answer to the sum really does n't it?
Just think next time you do it.
Okay you know you're looking for eight threes, what are eight threes?
Count in threes.
on your finger.
Right.
Seven threes were twenty one.
Eight threes are twenty four, you're getting better are n't you?
See next time you have tables at school you'll be able to show them how it's done.
Eight threes are twenty four, that's an easy one but what's the next one?
Three threes are?
You're getting there, go on, three threes are nine.
Now that was five threes.
It does n't matter.
Put, put the nine going to the three threes, I'll understand, possibly.
Three threes are nine, so what are five threes then?
Okey-doke.
So what are five.
Mhm.
Five threes are?
Well you've got five threes are and twelve threes are, you've only got two figures left, so which is to which?
five threes are thirty six and twelve threes are fifteen.
Five threes are fifteen, right.
That's alright, yeah.
Er I, I know what, as long as I can see what you've done.
And twelve threes?
Thirty six, do you wan na check that on your fingers?
You've got twelve fingers lend you two.
Okey- doke, go on then.
Twelve divided by three.
No you put it behind the equals sign.
You would if it was a proper division sum but you've actually put the equals sign there.
No they're multiplications.
Right, how many threes in twelve?
You do n't need three, you do n't need two fingers.
C you're counting i no, you're counting in threes three, six.
Right, four threes are twelve, you do n't need twelve fingers for that count each finger as three cos you're counting in threes.
Fifteen.
Yeah.
Eighteen.
twenty one.
Seven.
You ge you forget yourself do n't you and you go back to the two times table, we're on threes now.
That's easy-peasy that one, three into three goes three into three goes.
Eleven times table that one is.
Three into thirty three?
Count on your fingers, I'll lend you, you'll need a finger, I'll lend you one.
Well you've got ten fingers and if I'm gon na.
lend you one that's eleven.
Carry on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Twenty seven.
Thirty.
No, you're on thirty there because ten threes are thirty, you want another three, what's that?
Thirty three, how many fingers?
Eleven, right, because eleven threes are thirty three.
Thirty three divided by eleven is three, thirty three divided by three is eleven.
The whole thing is interchangeable divisions to multiplications.
Correct.
Three into eighteen in other words.
Fifteen.
No the answer is n't eighteen.
Do it again.
Three, six.
Fifteen.
Six, because six times three makes.
Correct.
Twenty seven divided by three.
Correct.
And eighteen divided by six is three.
No, no, no no no no no no, four times three equals twelve.
Three di three times four is fifteen.
No they're fine, you've just got to sort out what the difference is.
All these there are multiplications and you can change them to divisions.
Yeah that's division.
When you divide something by three how many threes.
See with the crosses well that's multiplication.
And it actually says here look.
That means division that's what, you've done them right, they're divisions but three into twelve goes four but at the same time four times three is twelve, you can change it into a multiplication but it, it does n't start off as one.
These are all divides all the way down but you can change them all because you say four threes are twelve, seven threes are twenty one.
Correct.
Because twenty seven.
divided by three equals nine.
Well I ai n't doing them, the book's doing them, it's different ways of showing division, you can do a divide sign, you could write the word.
you could put one over the other.
You've got one, two you tell me, you're the ones that doing the maths.
Right.
Three threes are nine.
Nine divided by three makes three.
How you doing?
Have you been chinking like this all the time I've been gone?
Right.
But in actual fact, although it's something multiplied by something, it gives you the answer.
If you t if you divide some it'll be easier.
Which one's this?
In a minute, can I come just now.
I'm just doing something at the moment.
with Alex.
Yes that's right, three times nine is twenty seven, yes.
Alright sometimes you see a pattern do n't you?
But you see if you make it as a, a division it makes it easier.
You say to yourself how many times does three go into twenty seven, nine.
You've got to learn how to change the sums round.
I'm afraid, no eighteen divided by.
three.
Yeah, so how many times does three go into eighteen?
It is n't a multiplication.
Divided by something equals three.
Which is just the same as saying eighteen divided by three equals something.
So put three into eighteen and see what the answer is, cos that's the answer.
Three, six, nine, off you go.
You've got it.
There you go it's.
taught you something has n't it?
Taught you that in the three times table fourteen does n't come after twelve.
Four multiplied by something equals twelve.
In other words.
how many times does four go into twelve.
I mean we are doing a certain times table.
How many fours in twelve?
Four.
No you're back i that's because you're stuck in your three times mode.
Count in three times table then.
Nine.
mhm.
Twelve, right.
So this is three times table or.
times three makes twelve.
Three times four makes twelve, four times three makes twelve.
That's it.
It's not four because you counted up, you counted the three times table.
Yeah, but there are four threes in twelve.
Right.
So how many fours are there?
If there are four.
Right, there are three fours.
You just change it round, that's all it is.
You have to sometimes learn to do a bit of guesswork with maths, you're doing.
Dear oh what's that?
Is that a car going past?
It's the American.
Well let's get these finished.
Right three multiplied by something equals thirty six.
What do you have to multiply by three to get thirty six?
Three.
three times something makes thirty six.
Yes.
Correct.
Start counting on your fingers.
Mhm.
Yes?
Thirty.
Thirty six.
How many.
Twelve threes make thirty six.
Three multiplied by twelve makes thirty six.
I think that's had it, I think the er man from customs Simon was saving that, the man took it all apart and I think that's why it probably got broken so quickly because I think they messed with it.
I do n't think the people that work in, in customs are very bright, I think they also steal things cos we've had things go missing have n't we?
Careful of that.
I ca n't fix it Alex er I do n't, oh hang on, why do n't we just leave those two pieces out, see if we can fix it without them.
Oh right, you mean it's broken in more ways than we previously thought.
No!
Twenty seven divided by something.
equals nine.
I do n't mean how twenty se many twenty sevens in nine, I mean how many of those blank, in twenty seven.
or how many nines.
How many nines, or nine of how many make twenty seven.
If you put nine into twenty seven how many does it go?
Say the nines you can do in the three times table and that er you've got to get a three in.
somewhere.
I think it's had it Alex.
No you you've gone too far.
Nine what?
Nine nines make twenty seven?
You've got nine nine what?
No three's right.
Correct, yeah.
You're doing.
I ca n't mend it Alex, it's broken.
You see you're doing it.
Right.
Do you know you're doing the three times table?
Eight, no eight times three is twenty four.
It was when I was at school.
Because they do things like that at customs because they're looking, they're always looking for drugs and things that should n't come in.
You're lucky that they did n't take the Turtles apart, they did n't open them.
It might be that it was just a little bit open and they think that somebody's tampered with it so then they, they open.
Yeah.
Twenty one divided by seven.

I'm going to read you your story now.
Tt he's lovely for you int he, your brother?
Go on then.
Oh my God.
Honest?
Well how did you find out that cos you have n't got any instructions have you?
That's good of him.
Oh and then you can just follow him through?
Oh he's a kind of, he gets released for favours done.
But you've managed to get so many exciting things going.
I only manage to get one thing on I do.
ah I do n't know.
In a minute, I'll come in a minute, I'm just doing dad's dinner.
Oh right.
well how, when did you find out about that?
a better game now is n't it, altogether?
You get all them animals and everything.

five more minutes.
only a tiny spot cos that's.
cider.
A tiny little drink.
Well it's strong enough for little boys.
Oh you had a little lot did you?
Put the light on.
Go on, the other side.
Out of where?

Alright, I think er Simon had your ten minutes, it's Alex's turn.
?

Have to go to bed early.
Lot easier than teaching.
Yeah.
It's much better without the instructions.
I can tell you something, Alex is a lot better than me at it.
We've been timing him actually, ten minutes.
Yes it has to go like that.
woodcraft?
So where's the change?
Oh never mind.
Probably in your trousers is it?
games.
Did Steve.
Simon, did Steve stay or did he just leave you there?
Oh.
library so as possible I suppose.

microwave all morning, warmed it up.
No point really.
Jeans and T-shirt.
Did you feel a bit uncomfortable in jeans?
a bit like that, it.
Do n't think they have.
I do n't think.
Has it fell somewhere?
Oh.
I told them not to.
Garry.
Simon.
Alex now.
Alex now Simon.
You were saying?
Your kids?
Mm.
I just said, goodness, I said we've been waiting for this parcel since before Christmas and he says oh have you duck.
Mm I mean he looked at me like I was a bit silly and it was only when I got it and looked he'd got after Christmas written.
Ah but I think, I was saying I think they've I think they've tested them at customs.
I think they must have opened.
Mm.
I do n't know it was just a thought.
Mind you if customs had opened it it probably would never have got maybe.
fancied them for their own kids.
Now there's a letter in there that wants filling in for Alex for Alison.
Yeah.
Yeah but I filled it, I've botched it up in a couple of places but that's beside the point, it does n't matter.
Probably when they see I'm at Keele they'll know I'm stupid anyway.
Nothing.
I just put a few things in the wrong place because I did n't read, you know, put them in too soon.
It does n't matter anyway, I mean I put er.
Yes I know, that's what I'm saying.
Yeah I realized straight away yeah.
That was it, that was where I went wrong.
That's right, so I filled it in because that's what you do if you get stuck on Keele you fill in the bits that the computer has n't.
sort of filled in.
So anyway you just want to sign by you, I've put your school and I've put your telephone number.
and I've put, no you ca n't my number and Keele and I, I've put nanny's number.
It just needs you to sign it.
No tomorrow night there's a P T A at Allyson Street.
Well Annette said are you going, and I said well we thought perhaps.
The, what?
Allyson Street P T A I'm talking about, tomorrow.
Well she said I'd sort of thought of going, are you going, I says yeah okay I said, if you wo n't go I'll, we'll go together, I said but I do n't particularly want to get, you know, roped into it at the moment.
I do n't mind going to show me face.
You know but just perhaps, perhaps occasional help and then maybe a bit later on get more involved.
I do n't want to not be in it but I do n't want to, you know.
well I, well I've got enough on at the moment.
Anyway then I said are they interested in this quiz night, and she says I have n't go she says she'd ask Jan, I said well give me a ring back a bit later.
Anyway sh she phoned me back and she said yes he was, he was dead keen, he wished it'd've just been like pop quiz but he'll go anyway.
So it's Thursday the twenty seventh.
So I said we'll get out tickets and they'll get their tickets tomorrow, we're gon na get our tickets separately.
It says there's sandwiches on and it's at the Oxford Arms so.
Thursday the twenty seventh.
It's the day after er F S A.
And you wo n't be able to go to the F S A anyway cos you're on your course.
Well it's an F S A or a governor's meeting or something up St Margarets.
I ca n't think, it was something to do with St Margarets, it was either an F S A or a governor's meeting.
Thing is you ca n't go anyway.
Parents ' what?
Not such a thing as parents ' rights is there?
certain things in the first place.
Yeah.
Well that's like sex education and stuff is n't it?
You can vote no to sex education ca n't you?
I mean I we I would I, you know, personally I think I prefer to do it myself than put th leave it up to them cos mostly they do n't know what they're on about anyway.
Push forward the morals and the philosophy of the Conservative government.
Like AIDS is a nasty disease that only homosexuals get.
It's to do with moral it'll be a moral thing wo n't it?
Take a moral view point.
This is that new thing is n't it?
Oh well it's always protection of the family and yet they're not prepared to put anything to the family.
Decent respectable citizens on the lowest budget you can make available.
No, I think er I think it.
it might be something worth pulling kids out of.
Cos.
And what the qualifications are,.
Well surely wo n't we have to have a meeting on that just like, do do n't they have a meeting for sex education?
Seem to remember our sex education talk was n't very s specific and did n't cover a very wide area.
I think it was mostly, you know, just meant for females of a certain age, it was n't really anything to do with anything else.
No that's it, do n't think it was anything to do with p it was all about periods and sanitary protection and stuff like that.
never mentions the condom.
Well that was our talk.
No but biology is just purely clinical is n't it?
I mean they'll do nothing about sex, they'll just do all about morals, wo n't they, and decent, respectable people I'd say and biology's just cold and clinical.
Int it?
They need to have somebody that's a bit liberal and a bit open and that wo n't be available under a Conservative government will it?

It's also in support of the nuclear family though int it?
One mummy and one daddy bound.
together for the rest of their lives, and no.
relationships.
Have we got a loony left council round here, we have have n't we?
Were there two fellas?
Oh on the course, education int it?
Have most of them teaching?
Now who's phoned?
Oh Barbara phoned to see about woodcraft, she said Steve had, or well either her or Steve'd take them.
Anyway Steve picked them up here.
I said to her do you think.
there's any chance of picking them up here, said otherwise I'm going to have to her take Alex late.
Anyway Steve picked them up here and then dropped them off.
And then who else rang?
Rob, Rob Robert Rob or Robert from Quickprint, Robert.
Bob.
No Bob, it was n't.
Rob, yeah.
He said you'd had two more fax, one of them they just wanted a current catalogue.
and he seemed to think the other one wanted to buy something but he, whe whether he could n't read the writing or he did n't understand it.
Something about a bootleg.
Could you get hold of a bootleg, bu but he did n't seem to know I do n't know what else he said about it.
Well I sa I said can he contact you later and he says well no not really, I said well I'll tell him to give you a ring in the day some time tomorrow.
Oh.
Oh you'll have to just try and call in but.
after school.
Well you could do, yeah.
I'm thinking I finish at three tomorrow but then I'll have to get home, Annette, I said to Annette I'd be there by about four.
but I, I do n't know er whether I could do it an hour or not.
It's possible I could s if I walk from Newcastle catch a bus to Newcastle then walk from Newcastle.
just take er.
He probably is asleep actually.
I think he did take something.
Anyway so it's the P T A tomorrow and I said I'll go.
er but we neither of us want to be.
to do anything, half seven tomorrow night.
You're, you're not going only me and Annette are going.
Sorry about that.
No you're getting the other thing on a Thursday the quiz night, twenty seventh.
Annette and John are going.
Well it's a night out.
Sandwiches.
So it's two pound anyway so if you've got four quid spare between us.
I've got a ten pound note I suppose.
Did you say there was something on telly you wanted to watch?
five more minutes.
Oh yes, they were a bit pleased but straight away they started getting, you know Alex was getting tired so we were getting can I get it out, can I get this out, can I get that and it were half open and I was frightened of losing the bits so I gave him one and he said no he did n't want that one he wanted the other one, so I give him another one and then I nearly gave him a clout.
Part of it's erm which I thought actually, I should n't really three of them each, you know he was getting silly.
No.
No they came.
no, no, we chose there were three in a parcel for you and three.
No there were.
Nothing's ever fair for you is it?
There were three in the pack.
No, there were three in a pack for Alex and he opened his bef you opened yours Simon.
That was it, that was how it came, nothing was touched at all.
Except Don and Debbie sent three pairs of pants, that game with the punchy springing thing.
and there was a talking.
a talking turtle and a book, both got a talking turtle each and it.
M er Michael Angelo.
And it was n't anything specific, it was just a turtle but thought perhaps Robert might like it.
I offered to give it to Daniel actually for his birthday but I, I fe I felt a bit sorry for Robert, I thought o opening all them.
He gives you things sometimes does n't he?
And takes things off you sometimes.
Have you heard what he's done on him today?
Tell dad what he done on you.
I said he'll get.
He has actually given Alex one, he give him a, is it?
Cos Simon was n't.
pleased about that cos he has n't got that one.
The old ones, the one.
Go on, tell dad what happened.
Coming from swimming, going swimming.
Yeah.
I had n't heard of it at all, do n't know what.
Were you keen on the one you looked at?
Did you want to see it?
Was it really an interesting.
Is that it?
Took one off him and said no swaps back.
I should n't worry too much.
Well swap it for another one.
Somebody else.
Swap it for that.
And that.
You do n't want that one.
swap him that and said here I'll give.
you this turtle as an incentive cos you're giving him the turtle anyway but he wo n't know that unless his mum's told him.
I'm confused.
Old er old American women.
Go on then, let's have a look and see how nicely you can put your trousers on.
At the front, and the zip's at the front as well.
That's right.
Why, when did you bump into a chair?
You should be looking where you were going.
shoes.
Go on, carry on, that's it.
Somebody put sand in your pocket?
Where was that, from school?
Another boy was it?
This dead, dead what.
He's dead is he?
Will, you mean he will be if he puts sand in your pockets again?
Is he your friend?
Well that was silly thing to do really was n't it?
You do n't put sand in people's pockets do you?
Get your own ba do you play in sand at school still?
Does it take, do they take you, you have n't got sand in your play room have you, in your classroom?
Well where, how did you have got sand in your classroom?
Oh right, so where is it, up a corner?
Cos there's not a lot of room in your classroom is there? lot of room.
desks and the tables and all the children.
I thought you had to go off to another room, to a play room to play in the sand?
Is there?
What do you do in the water?
What sort of things do you do?
There you go, you can put your clothes on now.
They've got sand and water in their playground daddy.
In their.
in their classroom.
You're uncomfortable?
Alright.
I bet they do put it out in the.
then you could play, you cold splash could n't you?
You can.
it would n't matter where the water went.
Have you zipped your zip, yeah?
Where's your tie now?
Put your tie on.
Okay right.
Well pull that right up like that your collar so your collar sticks up.
No put your tie on so it goes over your collar that's right, now it goes over your ti over your shirt collar at the back and then that's it but you'll have to, you'll have to do it yourself soon, you know.
No you've got it down, you flap the collar back down again.
And at the back, cos it's very stiff, you need to turn it right over.
Oh there you go, Simon's brought your shoes as well.
Put your shoes on.
Yeah.
Go on then.
Daddy's going now.
kisses.
Come on boys, let's brush your hair.
Have you both got your shoes on?
You've got about fifteen minutes to play for fifteen minutes now, then we have to go ut.
I bet Alex wishes he was going to the pantomime today.
You'll have to go another time wo n't you?
Right.
Simon let's get on, you see that turtle?
Give that to Robert, that's for Donna so give them both to Robert but the adventure game's for Donna.
There's your crisps.
And that's yours as well.
Yes?
Erm.
No, well.
Have to give you your mum's.
Now I need four pounds and so how am I gon na get four pounds out of a ten pound note?
Well not really no cos you Simon can take them now.
Oh do n't put that whingeing tone on.
How many have you had then?
How many altogether?
There's stacks of them in there.
Ooh goodness I'm not man's trousers.
Oh right, oh he jus oh goodness they're soft but they ca not, they're rough rough.
And the rest of him's shiny and looks smooth does n't it?
Cos I thought of them as rough but.
let me see where I am.
I'm just trying to sort out some papers here.
They've got to go this morning.
Is that you?
Are you Mr Alex?
Right lads we're going out in five minutes, I do n't know if you need to go to the toilet Alex?
Well you can do that you, well ten more, ten more minutes but do you need to go to the toilet before you go to school Alex?
You went yesterday, do you need to go?
Okay.
We've just got Fantasia have n't we?
Are you prepared?
and to each set they'd be any thing up to ten sub set questions, so er he says do what you can in er the hour, well it's not an hour, but it's fifty minutes.
yeah and, and you look at the clock at five too, five too and that's it.
so we set off going and I thought well the first ones were, did n't ask for a proof of doing it, just asked to do it.
so I started working through them, but without referring back to the notes that you know what some of them.
differentiated to.
so you really have to remember what some of them change into.
you can, you.
you can work out the mathematical ones.
but the trigonometry ones you have to know what they turn into I got some things, a couple of them I was getting stuck on what I supposed to put and then I actually go too far on some'em, I, I.
make them again you know.
any way he's coming round.
yeah.
well you can get so far, but then I work the brackets out and you do n't always have to work the brackets out.
you leave them as a full.
erm set of numbers, erm any way he was coming round and I just kept saying well I'm stuck a minute, he says why, I says it does n't look right he says well why does n't it look right?, he said well why does n't it look right?,.
I said look if I say it does n't look right that's all I know, it just does n't look right.
no I'd done it.
yeah.
but I'd done it you see.
but the answer did n't look right.
to the question.
well he's going through it and he said well it looks alright to me and I say well it does n't look as if it's connected, any way I won, I could see why then it did n't look connected.
erm, with because it was, erm as the denominator and not an numerator one it was, it was one over.
so it was right.
any way subsequent to that he gave us one which it was awkward working it out and then he gave us one over the same.
I said I'm not working all that out again.
I just.
and then do a different rule.
so he said yeah but there's another way you do it, I said well what's the point in doing it again, I've just done it one, he said well yes there's two ways of doing it.
no he did n't no.
any way I got to the last one and it was two combinations combined together, so you've got two separate combinations to do and then you're to put those two together in with a different rule.
yeah.
well I came out and I actually just finished them.
I just did the last one, the next, the, the, the next to the last one erm, I said er, I ca n't remember what the differentiation of it is, he said you would n't you have n't done it, I said no we'd started to.
I said I know it's an inverse, well he said if you know it's an inverse you're half way there.
so he said well what's an inverse and an inverse?,.
I said it's back to the original.
he said that's all you need to know so he actually showed me how to work it back.
but I said look it's Wednesday lunch time, I have n't woke up yet, I do n't wake up to Friday night.
you know I'm still struggling and we were having a laugh, but the others who had him last term, said he was brilliant, because he actually combines work individually.
rather than works just going through it and hoping you all keep up.
and we were saying last year we could of done with having him for a bit.
she was getting through them, they were just slower.
but she was getting there, her and Bren were er conferring you see I'd sort of gone through what I'd done and every now and again she'd say well I've done this and I'd say well it's right.
I think Jean's got more about her than Bren.
yes.
yeah, well Bren is.
I think originally.
originally she was going to do it, but there's a new one come in and she's decided to go on this management, managements and it's the new one.
it does n't start till next year does it?
yeah.
somebody else I know er.
somebody else's applied for it as well.
yeah.
I mean I keep on saying if I found I could n't do the maths I'd ditched.
I would n't go on.
but I think, I think if I did flunk out on the maths side.
I would look probably for another course.
I mean fortunately doing the maths.
yeah doing, doing the maths you see I do n't have to do another science next year.
cos it's already there.
I do n't know what, do you have any thing that you have to put in place if you do n't do.
well you, you've only got to get to subsid science.
yeah, so why would you have to do another one next year?
you've got to do another subsid.
you see I've got two subsids now literally the transfer.
and the subsid, sociology.
I work, er unless they say next year just.
well yes cos.
the only thing I wondered is if next year that you've got to do a subsidiary, and if you've not got a science you must do science.
no.
well the thing is in the end for all the subsidiaries that you pass it counts on the.
final award.
mm.
I do n't know.
it's, in biology what got me, when I did it, it's, it's, yeah.
the dictionary words that you have to remember.
yeah.
mm.
yeah.
yeah.
no.
yeah.
I do n't I do n't know that I'd fancy doing, I mean I did like biology, but I do n't think I'd specifically want to do the biology at the level that they're doing it up there, cos it's too much of a jump from what I've ever done before.
no it is n't though because it's.
a tendency to be based on what you can read and what you understand of today's social problems, I mean every thing we've had so far apart from the industrial revolution and the history behind it.
is being about today sociological problems.
I mean like we've had er woman.
woman and children of the third world, well that's of today's problem, what about they show you how it was created, it's a problem of today.
we had this day state ethnicity and racism, it was all about gypsies.
state, it's three separate groups, state ethnicity and nationalism.
and they did it on gypsies.
I do n't know.
that did n't crop up, what was.
cropping up was erm that they've got a very definite code of what is internal to them and what is external to them, it starts off what belongs in the camp and what belongs out of the camp.
and outsiders you are not gypsies do n't belong in the camp.
then it's what belongs in the trailer as to what belongs out.
mm.
but, they, the way the way they were, they got the, actually the the woman, she's a girl, she's a doctor of sociology she's, she's barely out of her twenties she's not.
Sharon.
absolutely brilliant lecturer.
she really was, she, she's on the antipology's staff.
yeah.
yeah.
she.
gave a lecture and all she came in with was some notes written out on some full scape paper and some papers for the over head projector.
but she just bowled over.
and.
the hour had gone and we could of stayed probably another half an hour without realizing that the hour had come.
and gone and then we went to the tutorial and I'm afraid Harry just, phew, it's just like wind up session, you know you feel as if you want to cut, to get it going.
but erm he was on about certain aspects that he picked up from her, but having been in gypsy caravans round here, as when they were on Line Brook you see we were always at Line Brook for one reason or another.
and they do have different standards, but I say they are different classes of the gy.
the true gypsies are clean, it's the, what we call the tinkers, just the travellers that pop on a site and move on.
do a quick kill on the tarmac and see what goes on in the town and then they move on.
but there used to be a caravan down here, I'm not joking the value of stuff that was in it, was unbelievable and it was so clean and every thing had a place and it was all mirrored inside, cos he liked the mirrors and, or glass work, oh it was beautiful.
stuck in the middle of that dumpy site.
but the site was they did their own down fall with the first ones that went on it, cos they ripped out all the water pipes and the toilets and the, they, they literally decimated the site so the Council said oh they're not doing it again.
the thousand of pounds.
yeah.
they threw it all in the brook.
so they refused to do it up, well the result was over the years the pot holes down to the sites got bigger and they're so far off the road from.
Brook Lane, but well what you could n't see you did n't know about, we used to take the cars down there it was nightmare and when you got down there, there was always the dogs roaming around and.
but there was some nice people.
but there was some rough ones.
but I mean when you start looking at what the topics are in sociology, there's nothing really.
if you've got a ma if you've got a mature mind.
I would think for some of the younger ones who have n't seen or read a lot in the papers of where, what's going on.
it might be very difficult and it could be.
boring, but when you've got that experience of, you've seen these things occur.
yeah.
well I mean we had one girl did n't know what she was going about, but, you know, women do n't have all the work to do in the house and her dad helps at weekends and I said well who made the decision in the first place to do what.
well we help with the dinner, but I said who was it that decided what you're having and got the ingredients together and had decided.
and she kept on about, but we help, I said but who do you help?
and, er well I did say er are you married?, no, will you be having any children?, definitely not, I said well unless you're prepared to take on the responsibility.
of a home and a family that a woman has with children, you've got no right to criticise.
oh we had quite a heated argument about it.
personal experience, yeah.
yeah.
so it is so easy when you're only helping on a side line because you're not doing any of the thought processing.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
I sat there and.
yeah.
I sat there last night I actually I'm on the way to the post office cos I got the erm form back for claiming for Christmas holidays.
and they're asking erm for a copy of the grant.
again which they've had have n't they?, for how many weeks in the year do you actually attend cos I said that you do n't get grant for the holidays and it stipulates the term.
you do n't get it.
well with the dependents allowance you get so much with it.
but apparently you see the terms are split up and you actually do n't get any thing when you're not in on.
the terms, well the grant form shows what the terms are.
so I said well it cost us just so many weeks though, I've put it in again, I've, I'm sending it back today in the hope that they will come up with a decision in the next week, cos usually once they've got the information they'll write back say within ten days yes or no.
but erm.
must be.
er I think.
I think she's got a quota.
yeah.
give a fair representation.
yeah.
oh well this P C F A.
er Trish.
er the, the woman who I meet up at you know who works in the coffee shop she was there.
she's.
blimey she said meeting you here, well she sat chatting to Emma all night.
they were laughing and giggling up the corner and er, I mean I did go just to let them know that although I did say I would n't come to every meeting I was quite prepared to still do.
what I could.
oh he would.
he wants, cos he wants to go every where I go.
to see what's going on.
and I said well your be bored, no I wo n't, and about half past eight, which I thought well we should be finishing by now, he said well are n't we going?
I said well we will be going and it finally finished at nine o'clock, erm, the the topics under discussion are all really relevant.
but they sort of get carried away slightly.
and chit chat gets going some where else.
yeah.
but er, they've got to get a new mini bus apparently, there in two years, which we new and er because like every thing else, it's funded by the school not the authorities.
but.
mm.
yeah.
he hopes but then.
if nobody.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
mm.
mm.
no telling cos.
tell him to watch To Sir With Love.
and then.
because he had exactly the same problems when he moved in.
and he's attitude was in the end well if you do n't want the education as it comes, we'll teach you the education that you want and the first thing was.
was to respect each other and that.
was my essay, I wrote in to the education was that, the top and bottom of personal discipline.
was the self respect for you and a respect for others.
and the discipline is only there out of respect.
yeah, yeah.
but the thing is I was reading this erm, I was reading another book on this erm.
I've not got through them all, I was just reading selective pieces.
the trouble with this is it's an American book so it's a bit, I call it biased, erm on erm the betrayal of children on, on the way that they're not in childhood for very long and it blames literacy, that the more the literate the child becomes.
the earlier the literacy developed.
the sooner they become independent.
and this idea of childhood being up until sixteen, eighteen years of age, was only.
yeah.
would develop only after the sixteen century.
in the middle ages.
children were grown up when they were eight and nine because they were working.
it's only changed with the, the revolutions that said that.
children were not allowed to be employed for different lengths of times and social change.
change the way that we thought children ought to be and educa.
yes and it's the education that is made children literate early on in life.
and it's the literacy that just de made them into child adults.
mm.
one, one of the.
one of the criticisms that has come out on this one book was that because the, these child adults are skilled and put into education, they maybe still illiterate, but they are street wise, they are literate of the street.
and, yeah.
yeah.
but they do n't want education.
because education changes their social standing, takes them off the street and then they're not at the level that they were, young adults, they're children again.
and they do n't want it.
but when they actually get into which country, I mean, this, one of these books as I say it was only published in nineteen eighty eight and statistics in it are as recent.
as it was published, she does make allowances, she says some of the statistics I upgraded at the publication of the book.
so there were nineteen eighty eight's statistics, some were the year before.
yeah, but when.
when, when you looked at which country had problems with education with children.
well we were considered to be fortunate that we did n't, we only had a small percentage that we had a problem with.
but America's rising child population who were becoming street wise and illiterate.
and out of education, but countries like Italy were all ready were a bit like South America.
they had street children and they have the leather sweat shops, most of the children from eight, nine.
work in he leather shops making all these cheap leather bags and purses.
and belts that you've got on the market.
and they're earning approximately twenty five pound a week.
and they're saying well why go to school, because if I go I give up that income, half goes to mum.
who they only see when they care to go home.
and the rest of it is spent on erm arcade machines.
and fast food.
well apparently the education system in Italy is so poor.
it's been destroyed, the buildings that they use have got no equipment, they've.
got no desk and chairs they're actually using.
yeah.
they're actually using old ware houses in places.
and old industrial buildings that they've just taken over and when there's a crisis in the housing, the state takes over the schools and uses them as refugee centres.
so, I mean, one school turned out to be an old factory and it was of six floors and it had one of these like industrial lifts, you know, the open caged lifts.
so the staff use that and the children had to go up six flights of stairs.
and it was in a back ally way and.
the people who were going round these different countries.
if we follow on the same way.
erm, I think probably because our education system developed more so with the industrial change.
and we were geared more to progress in the education system where the industrial change in the other countries did n't happen at the same time and that they needed now a younger ag a younger age group to keep the, the industrial system going.
that their education system's failing.
but, I mean ours is heading the same way with this rebellious education.
I must admit that, that.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah, do.
there was a paragraph erm.
a paragraph at the end of one of the chapters and, I ca n't remember the exact words but in, what it meant was that for the parents who do restrain the children from what they watch.
where they go, and that the education they receive, they are part and parcel of it.
Chris said one of the biggest failings was that parents did not take part in the education of the children, this is where it fell down, that, once the education was seen as a government thing that.
they'd taken control from the parent, and the parents quite readily gave that control to the state, they no longer had parental control.
so when they wanted to, to, to have a discipline in the home, they could n't have it, because they did n't take part in the education and then.
time that the education was put back to the parents to enforce both.
part of their early literacy.
the end cha, the end of the chapter said that if parents were to re-take on the role of educating and disciplining children within the home.
to what they watched, the times that they were in.
and that they took more erm more emphasis on the way their lives developed.
they might seen from the child's point of view as interfering parents, but in the long term.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
but they've said that in the end.
that those children would be the ones that survive.
the social revolution from education back to illiteracy.
cos they said it was all to do with social status.
mm.
yeah, but some books, in the books, in the book shop for sale doing that.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
no.
mm.
because every bit of encouragement you.
give him now.
it's got to pay off, because he wo n't be struggling at the end of this year to be trying to read and write, he will of achieved that.
and when the learning process of new material comes along, he's not still struggling on learning how to read and write.
because you see the one's who still ca n't read properly have.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah, they have difficulty then picking up new material.
because they can only accept what's given verbally, they ca n't read for themselves oh I do n't know.
but I mean I, like I said, I volunteered to go and help with this, I ai n't heard back from him yet.
but that was the whole purpose to sort of volunteering on that, because I know that.
oh cheers.
no, but, I mean our can read and he could read when he left the first class, he did really well.
he's perception of early words.
I mean he grasped what the word, he grasped the way she taught him and he soon learnt to read and he could retain those words.
I do n't say he retains as much now.
but reading.
he, with.
last night somebody had, had erm birthday that, sort of his.
to be, group, she's, her daughter is forty odd, but she still helps out down at the school.
and er, they sent her er bouquet and a card for her birthday, she was seventy, and she wrote a letter back and she passed it around for every body to read, and there was, in her writing, which was very clear.
and in it was the word appreciation, now, he'd probably seen the word before, but he did n't know the word.
but he worked through and he managed to get out that it said appreciation.
now, now I know if me sister's lad had got that.
he would have, he would n't be able to do it.
and he would be only able to pick out a lot of the basic words, he could probably pick out the beginning of appreciation.
but then he'd probably guess the rest of it where.
as John stopped guessing the rest of it, he now works out what it says.
so I'm, I mean they do say that his reading ability he's, he's.
up to standard.
he's.
his writing yeah.
his writing's like mine.
and I bear no responsibility for it.
but I did go into her and I said look, he's got my sympathy.
he is just like me he's brain is going too fast for the pencil.
and he has to write it down, so you have to get it.
however it comes.
and because he's going so fast.
he's writing gets faster than he can do it neat.
so he j, now he does make an effort in some of his books and, I mean they say write small, I mean on one page if he wrote any smaller I need a ma.
I need it under a microscope, it's so, and I said John you ca n't write that small, but she said write small and I said but, that is ridiculous.
and.
yeah.
and they do n't actually, yeah.
they're not actually printing, as soon as they can form the words, they join them.
I did n't like that.
no.
no.
why, why is the necessity though to accept joined writing.
Howard he, he joins them in so many varied ways.
it's not uniformed for the whole sentence.
the same letters joined together.
yeah.
if he was to print.
and then just joined those that were easy to join together and building it up that way, but he's doing curls on the bottom of G's and.
yeah, and.
no it is n't even proper joined up writing.
yeah.
well I think, I think his writing's.
got to be standardized, that it's legible, to teach them all to write as an individual allows them this.
well in the sense that they can all adopt their own way of joining words together.
but he's, he's are n't jo, our John's are n't uniform.
he's squiggle.
his join up in so many varied ways.
like a G they will join up in exactly the same way next time he does it, even to the same letter.
mm.
mm.
it is, mm.
yeah.
no.
if he let's join in the K, you, your lad had the same problem as I with John.
If you're going to teach joined up writing, there is a way of writing a K with a little loop that you can join up.
but they are ending up draw, actually doing literally a capital K and then just joining it up, which is not.
joined writing.
they're effectively having to re-write the word.
instead of it flowing.
if, I said, I said to John.
yeah.
Mr said, it's not.
well this.
well we had a parents ' meeting on Monday night, but I did n't realize there was one.
yeah.
but I mean I can see that for he's got, he's doing exactly the same, literally a capital K in the middle of joined writing.
if you're going to join a K you, you, you should, I mean joined writing to me should be a soften version.
it should be a flowing version and to do a capital K like that is not exactly join.
I do n't think I even join up some, I mean there's lots of words I do.
you ca n't.
yeah.
mm.
I mean I.
but somebody like our John who's.
been doing joined writing since he was nine.
and it's, it's better than it was, but it still does n't have.
he does n't have.
to it.
yeah, if you, follow.
the same rules, do n't just say to them well, I know they must give them they give.
he wo n't do it he wo n't work at home.
he said at the end of the day I've had enough.
and I, I mean that's another objection he's going to go.
no, no, I'd.
rather him.
I'd rather him come home with half an hours work.
because if he comes in from school he knows he's got half an hours work.
you at least can keep up with what he's doing because you can see.
what he's doing.
otherwise you've only got two open days when you.
can go and, alright you can go in and tell him right.
but if he comes in with some work, you can keep on the check of the standard that they're up to.
without having to keep going up to school, cos if you say to them oh well I'm coming to see, oh what you coming for?
plus at the end of the day when he comes in, you've at least got the chance to say right, you've got your homework to do, switch every thing off, sw put all these machines away and.
do your homework.
but now they have n't got any thing to do because their curriculum says.
it's voluntary, if they say to them.
no.
if, if, if he says I've done it in class and I do n't want to finish it off at home, that's fair enough, but what's gon na happen when he gets to secondary level and he's got this idea that if he does n't finish it in class, that's it, he does n't do it, he wo n't finish learning the topic.
yeah.
mm.
but I honestly.
do not feel that to say at eight, nine years of age, you see the little one's bring reading books home.
because they've got to keep that reading going.
yeah.
yeah.
well, I always do it through the infants, they bring home reading books.
and then it stops, they can bring a book home, but.
it's choice again, they read in class.
and they keep their reading books from the li their library going at the pace they want to go at.
and they do n't have to bring them home, well John's got books at home, but it's like every thing else, he's too busy with the games machines and the television to be bothered to get a book out.
oh yeah.
yeah he might like that.
yeah.
yeah.
I mean we went, we were last night, so, I mean he actually videoed er Battlestar Galaticca.
so what had, so what had we got on this morning.
but briar to that we've got this game show, you know, a bit like er Blind Date and I mean I ca n't stand them any way, and I'm thinking I have n't got the patience in the morning when I've got dinners to put up and I've got them to get going.
to spend every minute of that hour arguing.
but I, I'd never get them done, and I mean I'd fed Matthew and I shouted down and I said look you'll have to come and get him dressed cos I've got dinners to put up yet.
and it took me as long to put the dinners up and clean the shoes and I thought well he's swimming, so I got his togs and put'em in his bag and.
it was n't until we got to school, he says, guess what I've forgotten?,.
I says what's that?, me swimming stuff, well I said that's your fault, I said you.
yeah.
I said I'm sorry, but you've had all.
But er, the woman who used to run it er, I mean, I do n't know whether she's still there, Doreen.
She used to still be there.
And then er, there was another woman occasionally.
Erm but I think she's stopped, I do n't know whether Doreen still does it or whether retired from it.
But er I mean, these went to her.
They did n't go to playgroup sessions, but they just went the mums and toddler session.
See the mums and toddlers.
you stayed with them.
Mums and toddlers you stayed and you supervise your own child.
Well, there is playgroup where you leave them.
Oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have n't heard yet.
No.
Cos we presume he's still got to come.
Cos they said, you know, sort of Christmas time.
And his mum rang up er, and he had n't been, but he had n't come as yet so er What you doing?
Er.
She's er.
she's out to lunch.
Well, the doctor said it was that.
Erm because erm she started Wednesday but they're living at Stanborough.
And, she did n't, she was n't too bad.
the bones are broken right down her hand.
And on the Monday morning my dad rang the doctors and he sent her a prescription and on the Thursday he had to call him out.
And she coughed that much she pulled all the muscles in her ribs.
And he said she'd done more damage with coughing than she had anything.
else.
She had another prescription and it was nearly three weeks and she still, now, I mean this is like Five weeks she's still got like a residual.
cough.
And rubbish oh she was, I mean she never got out of bad for a week!
My dad, well in fact, we, we were laughing at my dad because we said, we said, it shut her up for a bit!
Cos, he says I'm I mean I will, she looks after him all the time.
but with her being ill it, she says it gave him another sense of duty that.
he had to look after her.
And he forgot all his own problems for the.
week!
Yeah!
And we had to laugh, he said, well can you be ill a bit longer because he, er, he cooked her something to eat and he feeds her and so when I rang up I never got her on th, I never spoke to her for a week!
She could n't talk.
She said she could n't even get out of bed, she could n't do anything.
He just had to look after her all the time.
But, like, you know, he says the way it struck her one minute, you know, she just a mild cold and next minute, he said the next she's so bad!
She could n't get out of bed nor nothing.
It really took hold in a few hours.
But she.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you ca.
Usually you do n't get a.
cold, following a cold with flu, what you.
tend to get with flu is more aches and pains in your.
joints.
very bad head.
and get fever.
but when you get a co, like you call flu, it's usually just a head cold.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah.
I one, I once had the flu.
and I knew I've had it.
I did it lasted about.
three days.
Felt foul!
I felt really.
as if.
it's as if you've been anaesthetized!
Cos everything aches and.
everything's a dead weight and because you ca n't, if you move your head it's, it's that much.
and all your joints ache.
And the trouble is with not moving that thingummy builds up and then you get this very bad cough down your chest.
But erm oh!
Yeah.
Mm.
Well I've had pleurisy.
Mm!
Mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Oh!
It's like a little neck rest for when you're sitting.
in the chair.
Yeah.
My mum's got one.
It's like.
Oh right!
Oh yeah!
What, made of like foam?
Oh!
Cos my mum bought one for my dad.
because when they go on coach trips.
you ca n't sleep properly in them.
Yeah.
Oh have you?
There'll be a Beetle drive erm end of February I think.
Erm we owned a little and just thought I'd ask the party see how many things that cropped up as a result.
of this er, you know, this if anybody had had any complaints.
or anybody thought something did n't work right and erm Julie's started organizing a plan day again.
Yeah.
Cos she's having some sent this year.
from Central Ford.
Well she said she did n't mind having at home but erm Terry said there was too much for them all.
to be honest the mess it must have left her!
And she was worried about getting the stuff up there, and I said.
well there's Jenny's car, there's.
my car.
and even if I ca n't take it up on the day, I could probably take it up the night before.
And I do n't think anybody'll mind the night before.
And put plenty of newspapers down.
Well, I'm not too sure.
I might find that by then my days have altered and I will be on the Thursday.
At the moment I'm going to have it increased and it is for the, from Friday now.
So when.
Yeah.
But.
er.
Well I do.
See, I did go last week.
on Thursday.
but I do n't got there.
I'm only part-time, part-time there.
It's less than part-time.
Well, that's what, I mean.
Er I mean, all I want Win, is something to do for four years than sit at home being a housewife and hang yourself as well!
I tried for a job.
The answer I tend to get off a lot of places is that I have to wait for twelve years.
and we do n't, we do n't think that you could do the job.
I know I could do the job, but.
you ca n't persuade people you can do it.
And working these odd nights in a care, a nursing home, the pay's not good enough to keep a family on.
So if I'm going to think long term I've got to got to work.
then I need to be able to get a a job that will pay sufficient.
But, you only have to earn a little bit and you lose your benefit.
So, you'll be ending up on the breadline worse than ever.
for what?
Thought as well, I've never had the chance to go, I'd like to go.
realistically I would like a job if I could get one and I'm feeling very pessimistic about getting one, because the chances of getting a job at my age, when there's youngsters coming around.
it's not going to be easy but if.
if there were any jobs I would be quite happy to take part- time.
And I really need a job that.
I need, I need to have to to give, I know how we feel but he's getting older.
Matthew's getting, you need a, more physical looking after.
and long term when the holidays come round he takes a lot of looking after!
So we really we one of us to be here to look after him in that sense, one of us gets paid.
to look after him, but in the school holidays, you know, it takes two of you to and mind him, because.
you need time off in the day when you're physically resting to him.
But if there's only one of you.
you ca n't do it!
Well you could n't though, but bearing in mind.
and we are so much younger.
and physically we've got no ailments that are preventing.
us from doing it.
But he's even becoming a complete, in the holidays when I've got the housework to do and meals to cook, and him to look after if there's another pair of hands that can take him out for an hour.
and leave you free to do a job, because you may think I mean, believe it or I've turned this room inside out today!
It does n't take him two minutes before.
I do n't care about the mess.
Oh!
Yeah!
I I do n't mind this.
I have this room, I've all.
the cushions, all.
the dining chairs, I've had everything out at least I have n't cleaned the windows but, I was half way through, well I was almost finished, I'd just just done the stairs though and Bernie came!
And I thought well it's clean.
I'm not.
bothered.
But.
When he's here.
I could n't, I could n't start doing it now!
And I have cleaned round him, but you know, as quick as I pick them up and throw them in the corner, he gets them out again.
And then with all these, I mean.
it's, there's ne, there's a never a.
there's never a time when there's flung all over half the time!
Er.
Well I mean I'm, I've got an easy time at the moment because I'm on today.
I only up to seven hours in a fortnight.
That's all I want.
Yeah.
Six hours a week.
No it's here.
Yeah.
Six hours a week.
And you go and.
See a.
Well that.
well that was last term.
Everybody in the first term is in in the morning.
Four mornings a week, it was compulsory.
And it is n't compulsory this term, if you're doing education.
And er.
I'm doing education so I'm not in in the morning.
Well I was taking them anyway.
Yeah.
Erm.
Yeah.
The o, the only thing I'm doing now is the subjects that I want to do.
on the degree course.
but, it's education.
And literally, I got, but I was got so little on I felt that if I did n't do some extra.
Me, I I mean, I've done I've done no work today because I went out to collect some stuff of a friend this morning and by the time I came in it was quarter past ten and I'd gone out at ten to nine so I'd missed the schools.
and I'd told Pat I'd go to and sing.
and I've not come back till twelve!
I've I've done.
some dinner, we've cleaned up and Bernard's turned up, have you done any work yet?
I mean, this is me, I'm quite capable and I make i.
No, I do n't go up till tomorrow afternoon.
Well, I've got fre, I've got bills to pay down town.
No.
I go, two hours on a Monday.
Two hours on a Tuesday, one on a Wednesday and one on a Friday.
Well what I.
what I've actually done.
is I've taken on another short course.
Not, because I need to take it on, but.
when I looked at it I wanted to do it.
It's only a.
four week course, but he's running it for two hours for two weeks.
Instead of one hour for four weeks he's.
doing two hours for two weeks.
And it looks so interesting!
And I wanted to do it.
And I tried to get on it at the beginning of the week but he told me it was fully booked.
Well I left my number so.
that, any cancellation she'd ring me up.
Well I'd already spoken to the man who was running the course, the lecturer and he told me I could go on it, but his secretary said it was booked.
I must n't have been out of that office half an hour and I'd, she'd rung here and left a message to say I could go on it.
And there were two more people in front of me that was waiting to go on the course.
Any road, erm when I went back to see her she said of the ones who came and asked to go on it, we've accepted you, but no more.
But, if I had n't have gone on Monday.
I would n't have got on.
And we only went.
we went back Friday for exams.
and then we went back in on Monday.
Well.
Yeah, I've had erm.
I've had.
four four points I've got three on the B's.
and I got one on the C's.
Well C's count but it's the bottom pass.
Erm and it's quite, you know and it's a subject I've never done before.
and the woman who took the course she did say had she had done the reading work it.
would n't have been the reading that we were given, because she said the brief in the erm th the work that we've had to read.
was far too erm advanced for people who had never done the subject before.
She said, I do n't care whether you are at university, there are certain areas that you need to know a lot more background before you can do it at this level.
And, the reading lists were unbelievable!
And we could n't get half the books out the library because other courses had taken them, we.
had ever such a job getting them!
I mean, I know, one, one essay I had to write erm wa was erm literally what constituted a person as far as philosophy?
I mean, you know what makes a person up, you know, heads.
arms, legs, bodies.
but, what makes ea up a person in the mind?
And the other subject, that we had an essay on oh!
I know which one!
Co could a person survive, can a, can a person, and he put person in inverted commas, not for the the physical body, but to be the person inside the body.
could they survive their own death?
And if you, if you had a religious knowledge.
that dead, there is a life hereafter.
then the answer has to be yes.
But you have to show how you believe that the person in you survives their own death.
Well I mean, I could have said it in about ten words, yes I believe they can because, but that did n't answer the question, you had to do between fi er.
a thousand and fifteen hundred words.
And I'm not, oh Win!
And I got myself you've got use other philosophers.
erm work, to prove your theory.
Well, I got myself all tied up between the the who said what and me which said where and.
and I found it really.
difficult.
to put it into words.
Well, I must admit I got about the bottom mark.
And then she's written nearly as much in red ink on the back as I've written it on black ink on.
the front!
And er she erm she said, I know what you wanted to say and I appreciate that you find it difficult to put it into words.
and the biggest tragedy is that I know you know what you want to say.
but I ca n't mark you on what you've not put.
In the class see actual oral erm knowledge, I could talk with any of them and put my point a, and I could come up with ideas could n't put it down in.
writing.
So she put a few ideas on the back and said when you do the next one try following these ideas of organizing the different parts of the essay.
Erm there were two at the end discuss the works of either Descartes or oh, ca n't think of the other one!
And, the other one was erm are the attributes of!
Ooh!
Er, are there special attributes or personal attributes only found in humans?
What it's asking, and it's a most ambiguous question, I mean, I think the question was.
did n't make sense!
It did machines are machines people do n't you think?
Like computers.
Are we producing machines that now have brains and minds that think?
Well, the answer to that is, no.
I mean if.
if I'm put on a ladder with a television set then forget it, because.
I'm no you know.
but I sat down and we had n't actually done the lecture well I could n't do this other one because I did n't understand this.
er reading and I ha, I could n't hold of enough of the material in the time I'd got to write the essay so I would n't have studied enough, so I did this one on machines, and I got hold of two good books.
And they were really interesting to read!
Compared to what we've had to read.
So I wrote this essay.
and she put on the back of this one she was thankful that at least I'd managed this time to get the mark in the area where it should have been in the first.
place.
And, I mean, she was a brilliant woman for lecturing.
this subject!
And it was just a pity that the material she was given or told us to read, she said was too advanced for us.
But when you go in on a subject like philosophy, to jump in at that level how adjusted you are it's difficult if you've not got any academic background to suddenly come in and have to start doing it.
I mean, psychology was as bad!
I found that difficult!
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
I suppose it's it's a better rate of pay but.
It's if you're on enough books to be able to get supply for every day, if you do n't mind just flitting around.
Er, if you get known as a good supply teacher you'll get the work to to begin with, you might only get an odd day.
Oh!
Come on John!
Mummy's here!
Go get your shoes.
Go get your shoes!
We're hiding mummy!
Ah!
Oh!
John!
He'll say, my mum says I have to be home for seven.
He's been here since what?
Twenty to four.
I always wonder when he ac.
Do you want.
not so bad, it must have knocked the telly on.
No.
Well it's twenty five to five.
Yeah.
Except this Matthew.
Looks like somebody should er.
No erm, I could n't get this to.
No, I could n't get the television on earlier so I'm thinking he.
he sort of must have switched it off and switched it back on.
But you have to use the box.
Are you?
Mhm.
Oh!
No.
Yeah.
Well when the kids.
when the kids are in here, I do n't get to watch any of my programmes.
But they've.
gone upstairs to play on the computer so er.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I'm quite happy up there, you know even if at the end I do n't get to end I mean I'd like to get to.
It's four years!
I mean.
I might.
Well.
Yeah, because this first year is an induction year.
If you have n't got a qualif.
Yeah, it is three years.
He did another.
year.
You ca, you can do, it can master five, because you can do this er, if you have n't got the A levels.
you need to this first year and it gets you up to that level.
right?
Then you do the three years.
degree.
then you do the teaching certificate which.
is another, so it could be five.
Right?
But, what you can do at is the teaching certificate with the degree which is what I'm doing.
So his final year he does teaching.
I'm doing it through the four years of the course.
If you go on.
the foundation U, yo you've got the option to start the teaching certificate in the first year.
So, where he's done the extra year at the end if I do this extra year at the beginning I can start the teaching certificate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Do your own thing while you can.
Mm mm.
A girl who I go with, she's been teaching as well and her husband's already in the hope that when she finishes they're going to emigrate to America to.
Because like she said, here he's been made redundant once, and he stands another chance of just starting.
another school and he's.
all set for it again!
Yeah.
I mean, I'm sort of looking realistically that after four years that the education system changes.
there wo n't be enough jobs.
But I'll have done something for four years.
I wo n't.
have been sitting here.
doing part-time work.
feeling as if I'm not using the resources I've got.
And I get annoyed!
And I know, I suppose people said oh, well, why put yourself through it?
But, you know, I thoroughly enjoy it!
I really do!
I e, enjoy the process of of.
finding things out.
Some of it I find a bit er a bit too obvious but in the same way erm on, on the sociology side, I get a bit angry because I see what society does to people.
And theoretically, it sounds wonderful!
And it does n't work like that.
You know.
if it worked like they say things work it would all be nice for everybody, and it is n't.
So, I do get a bit ac, I mean, th there's, there's one young girl in the class and, we were on about women's role in society and going on about third world woman, but even western woman have their position, you know, she does the housework.
and.
the shopping and the cooking and the sa, she made a remark, abo, and I said well it's always the same even if you go out to work it's still your job.
and she said well my mother goes out to work, but we help.
And I said, well what do you mean, you help?
She said well we all help on the weekends, even my dad helps, I said, but who actually makes the decisions about what you do, what you eat, what you buy.
how you cook it, when you have it, who actually runs the house?
Well we all, I said no!
One of you actually runs the finances, the shopping.
the decisions to be made, who's responsibility is, cos you just said, we help, you do n't make those decisions, your mum.
still takes on the responsibility there!
And, at the end of a we, when I put it back into the, the conversation.
it was well, erm I do my bit.
I said, well your mum's been out to work five days a week and you just help.
you know, you should do it.
if that's not her role, but you've given her that role.
But she.
likes to do it!
I said, how do you know she likes to do it?
Does anybody ever say to her, well I'll do it.
instead?
I said, are you married?
She said no.
I said, well are you likely to be?
She said, well yes but I'm not having any kids, I said probably that's a good thing, but I said she was so selfish in her attitude!
She would help so that was all it needed!
I said the onus on the woman in the house to think, to plan, to prepare it's her!
There are a few men that do it.
but by and large, most men say, oh well the wife all the time.
And if it's not right, then it's well it's your fault!
And in a lot of marriages the wife's total responsibility and if it was n't done she is the one responsible.
This is how a lot of them fall the by the wayside because.
husbands think their fault is they've no money, when in all accounts he's probably had more to spend on his luxuries than she's had on food.
But if you just ca n't manage it's her fault!
Not the rising prices and things.
And it was this young girl's attitude!
I was amazed!
And I said well I, all I'm saying, I was really angry!
I was getting so with her!
Because I said, you're another woman!
You do n't even.
understand the first principles of what being a woman is, if that's what.
you think!
Well there were other married ones in the group.
and there was another with a child.
And she said to her afterwards she said oh!
I could have gone mad, you know, but the tragedy is that during the courses a lot of them and I expect that the best time to learn is when you're young and you're more receptive.
But they've no experiences a lot of.
them.
and they're not appreciating how difficult it is for some of them families to send them there.
And a lot of them do waste that time.
Did ex, even went to so that the.
Yeah.
Three years term.
Er, the following year's term.
And asked why, well I know why she did n't turn into the morning lectures well I do n't get up usually, till half eleven, twelve o'clock.
I said, what do you mean?
She said, I'm not an early riser.
I said, but you've got to get up to get to the.
lectures.
I ca n't, she says.
I says well you can if you set the alarm the clock!
Oh!
She says, I ca n't get up early!
I said.
there are a lot of people.
in this place who have got up and done a day's work before they've come here!
I said I, even I've got up and got children up and off to school.
I said, I've got my own responsibility, that's mine, I said, but you're only responsibility is to be in that lecture for ten o'clock.
You've only got to roll out of bed.
walk across the road!
She said, I do n't like getting up before half eleven, twelve o'clock!
And, I said and you're being supported to stay here!
She said, everybody's helping.
I said, and this is what you're doing Anna?
You're not turning up?
You started before I am.
Ooh!
Your vain as well are n't you?
How long you been going up the Rainbow Centre?
No.
Ooh!

If they're hard.
So how long you been going up the Rainbow Centre?
I mean, you can get on with people like that that you've never met before you co, to get on at college exactly the same.
And yet you can actually.
I think he's taken yours on there.
You've got to repeat everything on the board is he?
Well if you can get on with people like that that you've never met before you can, you'd get on at college it's just the same.
So that erm.
Do you want a cup of tea then?
Has Ian taken yours on then?
And I think that you'd have to have.
another word after that.
Go on, off you go then!
Make your own up.
It's not fair if I help is it Matthew?
You've got this.
Different.
entirely different set up!
It i do n't look at it as school.
college is adult education, and the fact that you're all adults the relationship between you and the lecturers is not the same between you and teachers.
In a class, where you were at school, they told you what to do.
You should n't!
You should n't.
But you've got an adult.
relationship between you and the lecturer.
And it's up to you to learn what they're telling you.
If you do n't learn, at school they'd give you detention and lines and punish you for not doing it, if you do n't do it at college it'll be your mistake and your fault.
but you'll learn because you want to and not because you're made to, and there's a difference.
You would n't get them at night college, because people who go to night school go because they want to learn, and if there's any you've got running around as you call it, will be thrown out!
Cos lecturers at night cos they're not compelled.
People are n't made to go to college at night, people go because they want to.
If you muck about in the class the lecturers have got every right to send you off the course.
When you come out of there I mean, if you do like we when I've ever gone I take my shampoo with me and you can have a shower and wash your hair, get the chlorine off you and they do sell er, chips upstairs and they're not very expensive.
You can have cup of soup out the machine for about twenty pence.
And I mean, if you set a list to do something for a day Yeah.
I mean, by the time you'd set off walking you could set off at eleven and walk there till twelve go in there till two then you.
In Festival Park.
Yeah, we went.
If you go at the six o'clock showing, Monday to Friday it's two pound ten pence for you.
What.
No.
If you go the six.
it's gone up, it's two po, it's gone up to two twenty has n't it?
It was always cheaper.
But if you go any other showing or on a weekend it's three pound eighty.
The Cannon was always cheaper.
But, if you go at the six o'clock showing here it's two pound ten pence for you.
It was.
No.
It was two pound, and one eighty on the six o'clock showing.
But it's just gone up to two pound twenty.
But, I mean, it's nice at the Festival Park one, i it.
but go for the six o'clock showing cos it's two pound ten pence.
I mean, that's alright, but when you think you're spending two pound ten pence and then, if you come out and you want a drink.
and you.
Sorry, what?
Er erm.
No, hang on!
S O E?
No, you want S O W, S O.
S O W.
What else have you got?
What el, well well show me what else have you got and I'll tell you what you've got.
Sot is a word.
S O T.
Erm there are erm it's, I mean I, we do n't go very often, but over the Christmas holidays.
er, we actually went up to see erm.
Yeah.
Just said it is.
We went to see one that was twelve only.
Tell him to look in the dictionary.
Z O P!
I said S O T!
You said S.
You said S!
Erm cos one of the kids wanted to watch a twelve, and I got him in.
But it was too th the, the language on it was n't, it was n't bad language but it.
was difficult for them to understand because.
it was more mature language.
But then we went to see Suburban Commando.
Hulk Hogan.
Oh it was fantastic!
It's hilarious!
And it.
Well we have W W F wrestling on here you know.
This is what John's.
always.
But erm I said I'd take, we went to see another one as well, erm oh that Cu erm I'll tell you what i, what we went Curly Sue we went to see.
That, that's funny, but I think for you Suburban Commando would have been better.
It's still on.
But it's only on now er weekends.
And the cheap showing is twenty past eleven in the morning on a Saturday.
Erm what's on at Cannon.
It is n't on there, it's finished.
But that really was, it was funny!
Hot Shots, we went to see that was it.
But.
the, the, the ha, the humour is too adult for th, these to understand.
They said twelve, but I think really for the humour alone they needed to be about fifteen or sixteen because they did n't understand it.
We went to see Suburban Commando.
and then went to see Curly Sue.
Hello.
Hello!
I thought it might be.
You've just interrupted my thinking session here!
Ooh I know, but it's staying off so you'll realise why!
Yes, I'll be in the morning.
No.
I will go out at half past two, well, twenty past two I shall go out and I wo n't be back till half past six.
I mean, if you come before ten.
Alright.
I'll get back in from the kids ou, you know, literally, a minute past nine, so yeah.
Okay then.
Bye!
Er, I mean, I do n't go not because I do n't enjoy the pictures but I think that it's got to be something really special.
But over the Christmas holidays I was prepared to take them.
I did n't fancy Hot Shots, but I took them.
I fancied Suburban Commando, and that really is funny!
And then I took.
Yeah.
and then we went to see the Curly Sue.
no it's brilliant!
It really.
is funny!
But if you were going and choosing a pa, a film, I'd have said you'd have preferred the Hulk Hogan one.
But er.
I mean, this one does n't look bad does it?
Frankie and Johnny.
See the cheap showing on this is five to six.
On video.
Mm.
Mm.
Forgotten something!
I mean, some films I think they're pathetic in so much that the story.
line is very poor!
And they try and do it with a lot of gimmickry and.
the way they do the filming.
And, if the story line is n't very good, I do n't care what they with effects the film does n't work.
But that Suburban Commando.
it was absolutely brilliant!
Yeah, it's brilliant!
Yeah.
I was just looking but there's no wrestling on telly at the mom, it's foot er.
African football, Cameroons and Zaire.
Er I mean it is, I I like watching it morning when the skiing's on.
Oh!
No bother.
No.
I like the winter sports, you know, th the skiing and all that that I watch.
We watched Crewe play Liverpool live on here you know, last week.
Oh!
Some of it's a load of rubbish!
Bit like this.
Sky sports, football!
I mean, you're going to Africa.
I'll have to go for a little walk.
drives you daft!
But when you've been, Italian, German, French, and now you have the African league, you know, and you think there must be more too it than this!
Some other channels are n't bad.
but er see this is er, and this is Africa but, I mean it's on all the time int.
it?
These are foreign language ones, you ca n't get them in English.
That's an advert.
Cos that's another sports channel.
This is all advertising.
This is actually one of the fas, most fascinating programmes that comes on cos you get all these just look what we can do here, you know, and all American adverts.
And.
one advert can last an hour!
Yeah!
Eh?
You just.
No.
No.
It's got to be in the dictionary for it to count.
This is er bit like Blind Date.
This is those blokes used to live up here.
He's a stunt man.
Mm!
He was on er he was on, he he was a D J on the radio.
Bruno.
Brookes.
Mm!
I think it mi, might have been Radio Stoke, I'm not sure but I think it.
I think, I think.
it was Radio Stoke he was on.
He wa, he er, he was on ra, he was on was it Radio One or Radio Two?
But, he was on he started on local radio.
Oh I do n't know.
Do you find that entertaining?
I do n't like him.
Unemployment up again!
There you are, you look.
So much for er Conservative's idea of bringing down er.
But it.
when it was on television as the Munsters.
years ago and it's still on now, you get it on Sky, the Munster.
Yeah but.
but the Addams Family's no different.
It's just the same and I did n't find.
that entertaining.
Gid?
What did you get that?
You can have harp.
No, it does n't have an E on the end.
Are you looking.
No.
No it does n't, it's a musical instrument.
I must admit, er there are some good television programmes now, but they're a lot of rubbish in compared to the.
story lines that you, you used to get on some of the.
old series.
It seems that they make so many now that they do n't have the same.
quality of.
er entertainment in them.
Well the ads are a lot better sometimes than the programmes!
Yes!
I used to like that.
He'd take his bandages off.
Well it's God is n't it?
But you can have it with a small letter.
Yeah, God.
J?
Jog?
Yeah, to jog.
No.
No, you'd need to put a Y on the end, a joey, it's a sa baby kangaroo.
So wha.
Oh, Z O is.
Yeah.
What have you put, Z O O, or just Z O?
Well you could put another O on the end and make it zoo.
Oh well you ca n't then.
See there's a word there, wax.
And in fact, waxers, one who waxes or waxes.
Oh!
I do n't like seeing that.
This is mine, this is the side I like.
It's live at eight o'clock in the morning.
Because the Europea.
er, well the European clock is an hour behind us.
so it's actually nine o'clock and they start.
And.
Yeah.
And it's been coming from Austria this week.
and it's been er oh it's absolutely fantastic, I think!
But I would n't have the nerve to do what they're doing.
But the exhilaration of watching them come down.
And sometimes they've got one that comes on a test run with a camera strapped onto them and you come.
Oh!
I mean they come.
at they come over a hundred miles an hour on some of these runs!
Mm!
But I mean, look at the scenery.
though!
I mean you see all these mountains and I mean it just looks that beautiful and.
er clear.
I mean, there's no smog a, and there's no cloud or smoke anywhere is there?
Well it'll be packed ice.
you know, with them coming down it so much.
Yeah.
I do n't like tennis either.
Do, who was it was on here yesterday, erm the one that throws temper tantrums?
Oh well all you've got to do it's in erm.
Yeah.
It's got seven different audio channels and you pick up languages on them.
Three comes out in British.
Mm.
Two hundred and fifty pound that was.
I would n't have bought it, but it was brought as a Christmas present.
for the kids because there's a little man out there who's the only one in the family who did n't have it.
I would n't buy it.
And then I said well I will buy it as a joint sort of joint family Christmas present.
because he went on so much and then it was bought for him.
So.
Yeah.
Harry.
and I like it for the the sports, like the.
skiing, the round up of the sports.
And you get some.
entertaining unusual sports that come on, but also, there's a news programme on, twenty four hour news.
They mix in.
a sports round up every now and again, and then you get the American C B S news comes on.
And you'll get world news.
But if you come on when it's the British news you tend to get a, a more in-depth programme, it lasts longer.
you get more than just the highlights of the news.
Who's that?
No.
Yeah.
Ho.
Ah!
But she did n't want you to know about this.
She's probably jealous then of your relationship with him.
I mean, if she had a marriage with him and she had the relationship and now you're a good friend to him, and you're a friend to her, she's probably very jealous of the fact that you're.
friends with her ex-husband.
Mm.
Asking her what's she doing it for?
Mm.
Probably just her own.
personal problems that she she knows that if she loses her temper with you she wo n't really offend you.
Perhaps.
that's a good thing that you are a friend to her, that you'll take her tempers and you'll still come back.
And the fact that she can lose her temper with you.
you, you are just at the end of the line, and you take it off her so you take the pressure off her.
She probably thinks a lot more about you for being able to.
take that pressure from her.
You're masochist?

Keep going back for more and more.
Sound a bit more like you're Nightmare on Elm Street!
Cos she does n't have any relationships with the other.
people that were there.
Yeah, but.
going back to him just cos he's got money, if she does n't love him any more and she ca n't live with him because of the relationship.
You ca n't compromise your feelings just because of the money.
Well when you're being paid for doing a job that's the price you pay if you want to keep in work.
Well you'd have to i.
If you've got responsibilities of a family and you've got to keep them, then, as a mother she knows she's got her children to look.
after.
She'll stay there even if she does n't like it because she's got to provide for them.
That's a responsibility you take on with a family.
Or even if she does n't like, and as much as she says, well she does n't like it she ca n't give it up until they're old enough not.
to be a responsibility to her.
I could understand that in, I could understand that he's.
probably left her because of the job in that sense.
because.
she.
well.
but probably.
Yeah.
Mind you, the relationships between.
the man and a wife you'd never know what the problem was because the relationships that will be private to them.
But they'd let you.
they'd never let you into that.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
They're probably both very happy in their misery together.
Mm!
Mm!
Yeah.
You're better off being happy.
You're.
happy on the outside it and you show you're happy on the outside you'll invariably be happy on the inside.
And it's that where it counts.
