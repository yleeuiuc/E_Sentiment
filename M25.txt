even though it's about seventy degrees all time it still felt cold.
Do you want the settee pulling up a bit?
Er sit down I can manage with it.
It'll not set fire.
It's a hell of a long wire on that phone int it?

Yeah, it's alright for you, you were in a nice warm bath, I was downstairs.
Mm.
Mm.
It's nice.
I'll probably go gas, when they get gas down there the only thing that.
What for?
What happened to the other fire grate with electric?
It were a damn sight better bloody thing than that.
No it were n't ma, it were, it were it did its job, that was keep your heating up, cos you could blow it up and it.
ten minutes and you could n't breath in here, but that.
yeah but look at.
you've got to buy your coal now June and loo and I mean.
where I used to put two, two bags on a day, and have it up at number five and six we've got it on one bag a day and it's on nu less than number one.

I said to'em over there I says er have you er moved in then?
Got settled?
He says not quite he says but, we're, we're nearly there.
He says to me he says to me he's, I've been two or three time while he been int garden he says every time you come in here you lock your car, he says why you're only int garden, I says well I've lived round here for a lot of years, ha, I says and when you've lived here long enough I says you'll be locking your car every time you get it out.
He says why?
I says because things go missing.
You, it's a habit I've got into.
Yes, even if I go anywhere, if I go to, go into a shop I always lock the car always.
The point, the point is you know it, it is a deterrent.
There's nothing wrong with Colin's.
I'll have a look at it today I do n't think it's anything, from what she told me yesterday, I think it's electrical.

They'll be round er father's or somewhere daft like that or at their Geoff's mm.
Mm, probably got some work to do, on car mm, puts cos he do n't like Friday night.
It all depends what he's doing ma.
I mean er, I did n't like er that Friday night it were hor horrible shift, cos half the time you used to turn up, only half a team would turn up and you'd be expected to do.
er job with half a team and and it could n't get done properly.
You will.
leave chair where it is, just to give it.
We'll sort it out when we get to it.
Before we beep we'll go down in our car, bloody hell it's three times smaller than Pete's so I'll get it in our bloody car.
Dish cloth.
There ai n't one, there's that sponge.
No, well.
Mm, why did Steven kidnap?
Or why did Stef kidnap well I, you know I ca n't understand this girl, because she's been in er, I mean she must of seen him when, when he's approached her to buy the house.
so surely she must be able to give him.
Yeah but, I mean but it's right on.
motorway link so.
Well he's not, he's not forced to do, he just might know the area, I mean, all he's doing is sticking to er places just off the motorways int he?
But er I mean he's come from Birmingham up to Barnsley it's only what a hundred mi well is it hundred about ninety odd mile?
But the thing is she must've seen him.
Yeah, but I mean even, even so, she, she has met him once before and she must of seen him when she's gone to the house for him to kidnap her.
Alright he's probably blindfolded her after that, but at least she should have some kind of er.
you know I mean it's not just one of them surely she could give the police some indication of what he's like.
Mm, mm I'm sure, has he still got car in garage like?
What girder?
Oh that big one.
But what the hell did they took that?
It, I thought they gon na leave the key.
I mean it's alright, but nobody else can get in damn garage.
I'll have to tell him when he comes.
He still should of left the key here I mean there's no.
you know, I mean even if.
if they're leaving it one, just for one night, there's not, it's, it's easy enough to just say I'll, I'll put key on windowsill and.
last year.
He'll come out with it, you know.
Aye.
He wo n't pick the names, he he picks up, it's the ones he already knows.
No, it's only a checked it, I do n't think it's contagious, really.
this morning.
He wo n't.
Yeah.
Oh, he'll go out the door, one day.
He's just had a fright.
Colin.
Never goes near him.
I do n't think, I do n't think sell him.
I do n't think you'd get what you paid for him.
It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed.
I do n't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
She'll disappear.
They're very very.
We've always had cats, always had cats, when we lived at and we moved into and we'd had this one cat years, it were old cat.
I would n't say it was ready for popping off, you know what I mean.
It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared.
And yet.
I think he did.
I think she'd give the dog away as well.
Saw him coming.
Do n't lick.
years ago about Beryl.
Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home.
Will you settle down.
None of em will.
If no one will go down there at all and and sit with their mother for a for a couple of hours.
More thought of.
It's still there.
It's.
It's more expensive to use.
Come in, and shut that door.
Go over there, no do n't, she wo n't go outside, keep them on there.
We tried to.
And Margaret's dad, when they, when my kids were little would never take our kids anywhere but they.
And always relied on one or the other, I do n't.
I do n't care which one.
But they would never take'em out for day.
But they would fetch'em and pay for them, and I even today, you can not buy love.
And it's proven my point, our Dawn would n't even think about there.
Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Goes round weeks ago.
Who's gon na stop then.
Yeah.

they are, they're all like that.
All of them.
Yeah.
I think Colin winds you up summat chronic.
And instead of just.
Ignoring him.
You do n't, he and he going through bloody.
But, I mean, er,.
He thinks a lot about ya.
Yeah.
Aye.
No.
No, do n't do any more.
any more.
You've got enough.
Do n't rip'em.
They're to blow your nose on.
I know, but you're wasting'em.
It's alright like that.
You're wasting'em That back door shut!
Go and tell Auntie June to shut the back door.
Else she'll be missing a bird.
June.
June.
It was.
Did it frighten ya?
Aye.
Flies round your head, you know.
Oh aye, gets stuck in your hair.
He will get on your head an ' all.
He's got what?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Behave, bloody scratching.
Bloody big, stupid sod.
And Barney's in bed.
He he's in bed.
Mm.
Come on, come on, throw them over there.
Watch me tea, now.
Do what, love.
No.
Now, watch that tea.
Are you ready.
Are you doing alright, are ya.
Yeah.
Yeah, but one per cent's a hell of a lot you know.
It's a penny in the pound.
Yeah, once you get it back up to.
Yeah, well that's.
It wo n't be, it's not forced to be a building society.
Oh, well, it might be Abbey National.
Ah.
Well that's o that is a finance company and not a building society.
If it says finance, it does n't mean a building society.
Nine times out of ten, it's a finance company.
Same as er, Mercantile, and.
Yeah.
We've dealt with summat Wagon.
Scottish Amicable.
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money.
Yeah.
It wo n't be dodgy.
But you can always, easily find out.
All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring.
I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like.
You know, if it's a variable company.
Things like that, you could do that.
Yeah.
Well.
You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house, they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year.
Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left.
That's the difference.
And between them both, you can, you could I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand back.
Well, finance company.
You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed.
You do n't pay no more.
Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures.
You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out.
very high.
It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know,.
five thousand pound, not.
But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company, you're gon na, you're gon na borrow twice that, you gon na have to pay twice that much back.
Forty grand, you kn that's the only difference, and.
No, they wo n't send a loan shark.
You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent.
Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I do n't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at'em.
But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, do n't you, over so many, yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gon na pay it back.
You know.
If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years.
Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ai n't ya.
So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal.
Yeah.
But er, I ca n't understand why, because I mean, let's face it, he he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I, it's health and safety, yeah.
Through the health and safety, but.
Yeah.
But, after saying that,.
what you got ta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gon na use.
and then find out all about.
them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the company said this and that.
Yeah.
And they still.
Well, he has just flown about.
I say, he's just flown round bloody house,.
Yeah.
It might be dust out of his wings.
Dear me.

In two years.
Now, if that had been a finance company, I would have paid a damn sight more.
Thirty seven, per cent.
That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around there.
Makes more.
It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments.
When you think of it.
Oi.
I do n't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know, it it's totally unfair,.
I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance,'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it.
You know what I mean.
Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're would n't be half and a quarter.
I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries.
Communist countries.
Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing.
I mean, communism in England,.
in it's in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor.
The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for al for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep'em.
So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo the the.
poorer people, they stop'em getting educated.
That I'm I'm almost convinced.
It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you ca n't get educated.
They're cutting back on education.
They're making it so only the rich can be educated.
I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant and what's happening.
Sweet nothing.
Now we're, it were in bloody paper last on Thursday, they do n't get nothing when they're on holiday.
I mean, how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job.
If they have a job, they do n't get no grants.
And how can you have, hold a a job down.
And do education at same time.
No, you'll rip it.
Aye.
Get up here.
Off the grant.
For twelve months, now they do n't.
And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only corner.
Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ai n't it.
corner.
The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance.
straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance.
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that.
I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into.
He's no insurance no insurance whatsoever,'cos he could n't afford it.
Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er it all depends what the, what what you gon na be insured for?
I mean, even that, you're gon na you you gon na be insured for breaking in and break-ins and.
That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting for your, thousand pound is n't a lot of money.
Yeah.
I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer.
What for car?
What how how comes that, then?
Oh, aye.
Soft top, yeah.
Well, I mean, look at our Connie's.
Three hundred and eighty for third.
I mean, when you look at it, it's for a third party fire and theft.
Christ, that's gon na be a thousand pounds on a full comprehensive, just about.
Well, I I I'll promise not to fondle.
I do n't know.
Tell the truth innit.
How it goes.
He wo n't promise.
No, I do n't.
It's a big piece.
That paper.
It's only one like you had for.
Wet your fingers.
Might be dust.
Aye.
Benji.
Yeah.
It's got some cream in it as well ai n't it.
Suppose to be a but I mean.
Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers.
Aye, you go in there and it's empty that other.
I know, I see it.
Do n't work.
When what?
Oh well.
You do n't know how green, how green the grass is until you actually stand.
Well, get off there.
You'll end up with a smack bum.
No, he eats it.
What's that, that that young girl here says they wo n't have nowt do with them at all.
Any relations.
I know.
She's is his cousin.
She's his cousin.
'Cos I says to her one day, well why do n't you ask yer, your relation, if he'll er, if he'll give yer a job.
Give us a job, she said, he wo n't even pass the time of day with us.
I said, well, I, there must be summat there, out there, she said no, he said, she said it goes back a long time.
But er, she says, never even speaks to us.
And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is.
He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow.
I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know.
You know that big round tin.
I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom.
Get away with one.
You wo n't, as far as we're having to buy coal at that price.
You know that big round tin?
I do n't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom.
Get away with one.
You wo n't while we're having the buy coal, at that price.
He probably will.
Especially if this mild weather stops.
But it is mild today, ai n't it.
Get down.
It is n't.
You're crackers.
You might, and then again, you might be a millionaire inside three months.
Yeah.
Oh well.
Oh, it probably will be.
Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences.
I know we're hard up, but you can ten pence.
Oh.
Yeah, might.
You might.
Who?
Aye, the.
You've, you've got to, but how the hell get it, if he do n't get paid up front.
Well, wages,.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
He needs somebody.
Yeah.
You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit?
Oh, I do n't know.
It's like everything else.
Oh.
No.
Why do n't you get a free put on market.
Oh aye.
Mm.
No.
Bloody ridiculous.
Yeah.
Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business.
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
There's always summat else you can go and do.
No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for'im.
And it kills your eyes welding.
But as he said to me, why do n't you go welding.
I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is,.
what's the point in making them worse.
So, jump in me box, and I ai n't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years.
I'll manage the way I am.
Aye,.

Yeah.
It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months,.
you could be struggling to keep it above.
and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills.
I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under.
Because of it.
They do n't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya.
I know.
Let's hope he gets off the floor.
It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power.
I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all.
I can tell you that, now.
Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker.
That's it.
He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time, y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose.
Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but do n't wan na work for it.
There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford,.
round about here.
Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm.
You know, I mean.
Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him,.
Yes.
Get settled.
Where's Gavin like, is he with Colin?
Do n't make sense.
Ten days.
Could be ten, between ten and twelve days, could n't it.
Well, you'll have to wait while.
He's like with everybody, ah, give us a cuddle.
If you're cuddling me, you wo n't move.
It must be the summer what does it.
It wo n't matter whether it's born on your Margaret's birthday or not, it still wo n't get nowt.
Who's it for.
Oh.
I thought it was that wife.
Norma.
Pack one, her.
You have to lose a race now and again.
I ca n't understand your cross.
Can not understand or something.
Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese.

Yeah.
oh shit.
No, it's not er, it's so much I mean, he's at work all day, and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down,.
and what happens.
He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, ca n't abide.
Summat wrong somewhere.
Yeah, it's convenient.
Yeah, but she's got all the shares.
Aye, not with Bl not with.
Yeah.
Oh, aye,.
Exactly.
Yeah, well he is, what ten years.
Thirteen years difference.
Yeah.
You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just leaving it.
Do n't work.
The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about,.
if yo if one's fifty over sixty,.
then it works.
But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does.
But when you get into your forties.
It works.
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Well, I like to go on rides.
I go on rides, June wo n't go on.

Yeah, I know what you mean.
Fifty-three.
I'm fifty-three.
Well, I'm fifty-three.
Yeah.
Instead of'er keeping him young, she's, he's making her old.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I mean, I mean not.
Yeah.
One, two, three.
Oh yeah.
And we've only moved into here.
No.
No.
I could n't move like that.
Yes.
Too noisy, were n't it.
Same thing,'cos it's noisy down there.
Used to sleep.
You do n't hear it.
Yeah.
No.
Perhaps you get used to.
Where to yeah.
They wo n't.
They wo n't'cos'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at'em.
I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it.
Park here at your risk.
That's the only difficulty.
Oh, not leaving one on bloody road.
It's a one way street and all ai n't it, that makes it worse.
No, but I mean.
Another'ouse.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
She's there.
Dust, yeah.
It's not his feathers, it's dust.
Wax.
The problem is, it's dry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were.
Took us an age to cut it.
Yeah.
You do, you get it off any bird.
That's what I say.
June, I did I did all dusting and polishing one day.
And this silly bugger's out, playing about.
and when she came in, she said, you have n't done dusting.
I said, I have, but I bloody have.
But she would n't'ave it.

Oh yeah!
Oh!
Look at traffic here!
Maybe you should have gone other bloody way!
Twenty three quid?
I were gon na say!
I suppose it's lot of money when you reckon it up into today's value.
Anyway, when I first wanted to buy us own house when we first got married we were talking twelve how much?
Five thousand.
And that was a lot of money.
Mind you, it was when you only got fifteen quid a week.
Hard labour.
Okay?

Another fine mess he's got into.
Ha!
Then there's fog speeders.
It's either broke down or it's been an accident because there's three cars there not just one or two.
One at either side of road!
We'll have to get some plaster June for that wall.
Where's best place to get some from?
Mind you, we'll go buy some and your Corrinne'll be down with half a bag or summat daft like that!
That's what I call an idle woman!
Just getting paid for nowt!
Bloody how they, what the hell do they want a lollipop lady on a zebra co.

It's a total waste of money!
And there int one on this one here and it's nearest to school!
All go to.

Is it?
Hunger Hill.
I wonder why they call it Hunger Hill ma?
I wonder why they call Hunger Hill?
Eh?
It'll probably be whatsername's June!
What they call him?
Him who's er.
It would n't surprise me now you know!
It would n't surprise me at all.
Cos you do you've not been anywhere unless you've been made bankrupt in this place round here.
Come on!
Where you going mate?
That's what I say it's er bad time int it between.
half past eight and nine?
Especially when it's that foggy.

This time they're out in, in town int they?
Selling bloody second hand motor bikes!
The Baileys.
La la da dee dee da dee.
Eight fifty one.
I ca n't understand why this part of Doncaster is forty mile an hour!
Can you?
This is a built up area int it?
Houses on both sides of.
road.
It's a wide road.
But that do n't make it, and it's it's still a built up area.
I mean, they make it thirty and people will travel at forty anyhow.
Nine times out of ten.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Probably be about fi five foot seven wo n't you, or summat?
That's.
You're probably about five foot seven are n't you?
Thirty minutes!
Well what do they expect you to do?

them.
They all are are n't they?
Yeah but if you get in there yo you wo n't get out I'll drop you in there.
I'll see if I can straight back into it there.
I would have co thought it'd be better here.
Squeeze in there.
Come on!
Oh heck!

Horrible!
And when he gets the other stuff they give you that big bloody beaker full of it!
Our Dawn thinks she's at a tea party!
Our Dawn thinks she's going just for a tea party when they to ask her to drink owt she just takes her time and drinks it.
Pull i hold the other end and pull it.
Oh all you got ta do is to hold that white, hold both ends of it and pull it, it'll come out.
It is, to join it to that.
Think you bloody would!
That's probably what it is lifting glass up too much.
Oh!
See what my stars say.
Ha!
It says no doubt employers employers or other individuals will keep on pestering you, and probably add insult to injury, take heart.
Your ruler Venus is also sparkling away in the heavens today.
If you held the cup and let me get hold of handle I'd have been alright.
Mm!
Big deal!
Mm!
I think they've got a bloody cheek, you know, asking for a car park fee when yo si from the you've got.
Yeah, but, I mean to say if you do n't pay it they clamp you.
Then you've got a twenty.
pound fine to pay if they.
clamp you.
Well we know.
But unawares you could, they can put on, same as they've done yo with your mam er, up to an hour.
That hour can go into two and three bloody.
hours!
The thing is June if it puts you to some inconvenience then do n't it?
Of going and saying you've clamped my car and who do you.
and that chap's never there!
Oh aye!
Mm.
Excuse me.
June.
June.

Rubbish.
Wan na read it?
It was.

He has?
Well that's a better way int it?
I would n't call that lo I would n't call that a petrol account.
That's paying for his petrol before he gets it.
A good idea.
That's the time we go to time.
of the week innit?
What?
He must do some motoring then!
What yo.
What you talking about, fifty gallon?
As near as damn it!
Forty eight, yeah.
I should say forty.
nine.
How much is Jacksons?
Two pound.
Two pound six pence.
It's near enough fifty gallon June as damn it int it?
Yes.
Oh aye!
It'll go up with a bang I think!
April int it?
Never!
They always budget for April.
Not unless he's putting a mini-budget in.
Before election.
To see how good he is to the people.
Grand job!
Ha!
You can bet he puts another two and half percent on V A T.
As daft as hell!
No.
You're using too much water ma.
Mm.
You're only supposed to use a small amount of.
water.
Yeah.
We've not been long here really have we?
You were only half an hour.
You were only half an hour.
It always is.
He had n't fetched that key back for garage has he?

What shift's Pete on?
Oh!

He would be.
He is now it's.
Well that week I phoned him.
Week before.
Course, he wanted to know if we'd got a video we could lend him.
He wanted to know if we vi borrow one of our videos.
Yeah.
The only trouble with plastic.
only trouble with plastic it sweats like hell!
Oh!
If you're gon na have double glazing going to that exte that expense, you may as well get the aluminium and.
There's no problem with them then.
Cos them plastic things, they do split.
And the nature goes out of plastic.
Cos that's what Margaret stopped paying her paying for them did n't she June?
She would n't pay for them because th the plastic and all that started splitting and.
Yeah.
Could go in some time or other.
Well he, if he co if he'd have come down my wa he come down at eight or nine o'clock the shops would have been shut.
Mm.
Well ta tha that little shop?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh well.
Mm?
What, brown?
D'ya want it for your dinner love?
It'll do him for now.
It'll do him for now.
In a single house.
Yeah.
Well that's typical council that int it?
All they, all they know is it's an house.
But she's not that old is she?
It pays when you're on dole ma.
And it's cheaper by the dozen.
I do n't think it's worth the hassle though.
Having house full of kids and being on dole.
Well, yeah, some people thrive on it.
Old Ted!
Oh!
Aye.
Yeah, they're brought up right.
They were having a right ding-dong other day!
Were n't they?
Somebody were a having a right ding-dong other day when we were here.
They were a having a right ding-dong other day!
Mm.
Cos I thought about getting a glass and sitting here with glass at the front door!
Were it his daughter?
Yeah.
She were n't half giving it him!
Mind you, that's what our Brian did were n't it?
They came here.
And they went to America, then came back.
They said it were cheaper to come here, then fly from here to, to America than what it was to go from America, from Australia to America!
It surprised me that!
It wants to stay and get that.
I prefer wind to blinking fog!
Any day of week.
I think it's the fog what gives you all chest complaints on quiet.
Cor!
We've had some this last few week.
Saunas are no good!
They only get your skin clean ma.
That's all they're designed to do.
We've got one.
You're not getting owt till I get a new suit!
Suit.

I'll say!
You've no chance!
And she nearly got her bloody marching.

Right!
Then she's wondering.

when she comes and we're both in pigging bed!
I mean, what if her car had of been broke into.
You know, I mean.

I've just had a rise on mine.
On my pension!

Oh!
From Coal Board?
Ah!
But, it's a different pension scheme.

Dad working to.
I could never understand that because I thought dad was in in the whatsername?
I thought he were, I always thought he were in superannuation.
Mm.
Yeah, but ma ma ma dad should have er in superannuation.
I ca n't understand why he was n't.
He probably agreed not to go into it like, you know, or did n't want to go into it.
But he'd have been, he'd have been better, well well he would n't have done.
You'd have been better off.
He'd always got, he always put his hand in his pocket wou could n't he?
Yeah.
What do you want?
Small white thick loaf?
Well you can toast brown.

You never know somebody might have just.
come in dark yard.
You see, if somebody just come to that corner.
it picks it up.
And they go and walk back and you would n't know they were there.
I mean, that's what it's for.
I think we'll have one when I get ours other house.
Do n't think so.
Mm!
We do n't know if it works.
Alright then?
We'll see you.
