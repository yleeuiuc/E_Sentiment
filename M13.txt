Well it's never stopped you before!
Mm.
No, you were right what you said though about.

Mm.
It's hard being positive.

Well I do and I do n't sometimes.
Yes.
Like I said he's his own worst enemy!
And everybody else is fed up with him!
Mm, we need a support teacher to go there.
Mm, it's difficult.
Well I do n't think there's provision for him now you see because it's a.
there's a term and a half left before he moves on.
Oh yeah, well there must have been.
a problem identified earlier on but er.
Well, it's like so many other things is n't it?
Yeah.
Not much, yeah.

Yeah I saw the car.

It's a racket.
Not it's a well I'm not.
well I mean I'm not surprised they do n't wan na take a picture of our garden cos it's a mess but er I'd have thought he would have taken a picture of yours and sold you one.

Okay I'm on holiday.
I do n't give two hoots about people who know you.

I mean I need a rest.
Think I've earned it, do n't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, working hard.
Anyway I, I've got me soap.
In fact the only thing, I, I'm hoping Robert's packed me the razor, I'll have a shave when I'm there you know?
It was was n't it?
Yeah.
Yeah it's lovely there, yeah it's erm a m just, a metre at both ends and then it shelves down to a metre and a half in the middle and it's great, it's warm, it's, you know, it's about about body heat actually.
Yeah.
Thirty, thirty one degrees, yeah.
You get in there, it's lovely.
And even Rebecca can stay in for about twenty, twenty five minutes.
Yeah.
You've dropped your your weeds.
You've got lots of people then have you, coming today?

Will he catch them again?
Yeah.
Right well we'll see you later.
Okay we'll have a, do a few strokes.
Yeah it will be.
See you later.
Just speak into that will you?
Speak into that.
No there was a lady came round the other day, you know asking for erm volunteers to erm tape, you know, recording conversations between people and yourselves and the family, you know?
Er.
Yeah sh.
Well you obviously, she was looking for a spec a gentleman within a certain age range.
You just did n't quite qualify you two.
See you later.
Pardon?
Yeah.
Er, what does that mean?
Come on then.
What's the matter now?
What?

No it was going anyway.
Yeah it's on now.
Yeah.
Whether it'll hear cos the car engine was going.
Right, come on.
Right, everybody strapped in?
Right, okay, cor it's like driving a bus.
Ha, did you see the cat carry a mouse across?
He's having you on you know about that.
Oh right.
No he said that fellow was, last night who was calling round all the doors, was selling erm an aerial photograph.
Or Peter's he said.
I said oh well they must have cut the film off there.
Twenty pounds.
Mm.
Yeah it's been for sale for a long time.
They're all large gardens are n't they, round here?
Nice fr, nice frame that is.
It's.
very it's very rural.

That's right.
Oh it is between the two villages.
Thank you Rebecca.
Mm.
She's going through the.
all the wor yeah, process.
Is that mud on the road?
Yeah it is.
Yeah it's the farmhouse innit?
That might be one of those that you know, family build.
Sorry Robert?
Who's Barry?
Oh the chimp yeah.
Barry the monkey, yes I know who you mean.
Little toy.
Oh I do n't, I think so.
I think it's been closed for a long time actually.
Doing a good job.
What?
Oh somebody'll be doing it up themselves.
It'll be a smart house.
Er not really.
oh been closed ages that has.
Mm.
I would put in for that if it came up.
I think so.
Well it would be silly not to would n't it?
Give it a go.
Well.
Not much.
No the only parent I knew.
Yes and erm.
I think's dad Paul, Timmy's dad was the chairman of governors.
He's still there I think.
Yeah.
See that also epitomizes what I was saying before, you know I mean if I'm there you could be stuck there for the remainder.
Oh yeah.
And there's always the danger of it could it be changed, and then you've got the whole curriculum area to look after.
Instead of having three to look after I'd probably end up having to look after a seven or eight.
I mean it's, there must be a time when it settles.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
And that does n't fill me with any great er.
Well.
the Scottish Nationals.
Mm.
Well it's never too far from the back of your mind though is it really?
Yeah a pheasant ran across the road.
They normally do that.
I s it's a good job I, it was in the grass verge cos I saw the.
They're very colourful, yeah.
There's lots of them about.
It's probably from.
round here actually.
Yeah.
Yeah it's a bit garish.
Yeah.
Tape while you pay, yeah I will do.
Mm a line of washing.
I think they had to close this pub down you know I was listening to somebody talk about it cos there were drugs going on in it.
Yeah, they were drugs.

Really colou.
Really colourful.
Take it for granted like everything else, I know.
Mhm.
No it's in, it's in Stradbroke innit?

Have we got everything out of the car?
Is everything locked up?
Robert Robert, Robert wait Alright you two Have you got everything there?
No it's er it's electric, it's an electricity sign so you have to be very careful.

That's what she said to me.
She said she had n't been for a while and erm then she said they did n't really know, they wondered how she was gon na get on in the water.
Well she had some floats on I know but.

Right.
Cor they're heavy.
There's a good twenty five kilos here I'd of thought.
Hold them safe.
Nice.
Lounge, dining room, study.
Yeah there's a study.
No it's about the size of our bathroom and toilet put together.
Study's there.
Upstairs, everything will be.
Er there's quite a lot, it goes round the side, round that way, it's a big L shape.
And you've got all this round the back here.
Yeah there is.
I mean alright the pub garden's next to it.
No well I do n't know though, there would n't be much.
And the pub, there's nobody in the pub look.
Well.
Aha.
Yeah.
Look there's the garden.
But I just wanted to see what it had downstairs, it was typically new, it's a, a lounge not much bigger than the one we've got now erm in fact I think the lounge and the dining room area was probably a little bit smaller.
but a bigger kitchen a downstairs loo er.
Y oh yes it would have, and er a small.
Ooh hell's teeth no.
Could n't afford it, and we could n't sell our house Sue.
I think something like that one could be going for about eighty five thousand.
Well it's been gone, it's been built for a year er er er er it's been up for ages has n't it?
It's just its location but it's nice.
Yes.
Ours, ours has got a bigger garden.
I do n't like that one because of its proximity to the pub.
I just wan na see for some ideas Robert really, you know?
Oh.
Just i ideas for decoration and.
I think the toilet needs to be, well if I do the toilet this week.
The bathroom, sorry, the bathroom.
Well the toilet needs doing any.
If I do that.
Oh we're gon na do our room at Easter time I think.
I've got that targeted I think for an Easter job.
The bathroom and the, and the kitchen.
Yeah nobody knows what's happening April time as yet.

Mhm.
Ooh.
Who's in there, Andrew?
Just as well innit?
Nice and warm was it?
It's lab labour intensive is n't it?
Probably that's why that's so expensive.
Yeah.
It's very rare that a swimming pool do actually.
Yeah.
Yeah well what happens if you just get in at the end of your or a at the time before they change the band, the colours?
No cos I've seen this done before right, I mean it's over a certain time, but if you go in at the end of the time.
and you, you, you.
Yeah but you do n't, you never, if you get.
you never get the same amount of time as anybody else.
I've always thought that's a, that's a totally unfair system.
It's best with the, what, the best way I've seen it is with a numbers disk.
Say from one till ten cos they're the early ones and then they get a certain time, then your numbers eleven to twenty.
Yeah but it's flashing just as long for those who bought it first time round, is n't it?
You still get extra, you still, you do n't.
Sa oh well if it's the same time, yeah i.
providing you're at the same time.
No I was gon na say normally if you do n't, if there's no time restriction.
Yeah, mhm.
Well they have to wo n't they cos otherwise it'd be just.
Is it clean?
Like Stradbroke innit?
Yeah.
But you just.
Oh we.
That's what we do.
Yeah, that's what we do.
Pat might want it for storage you see.
But if you do n't need it get rid of it.
I mean I could always yeah I can a.
No we're having a cup of tea and a sit down.
We've been busy all day.
All day.
