
I'll have to see what it looks.
Well it is and I oh anyway I want to sharpen that rod on it.
Er, so I'll probably go down and see Dennis, get er a nut so I can get it level, cos it keeps only cutting on half of the side.
This is a good one Dave.
No I forgot it that.
I know you could, but.
I thought I'd done it and then realized.
Should have said we were watching football today.
Simon?
Oh!
Simon.
I do n't know if we're gon na go out.
I mean if it's nice and we'll either garden.
or we'll go out it depends what.
No.
I must fill up the list though because there's a lot of things coming up.
We've got to decide about Monday night.
I do n't know whether you can take David out to do that way or.
And it starts.
it starts at seven thirty.
Oh it starts at seven?
But.
it looks like you know, it goes on until at least nine thirty or ten.
Yeah.
He's at Cubs.
Yes but him and Cubs and going to.
the quiz do n't tie in do they?
Chris what do you want next love?
Which sort?
One of those?
When's that?
Mm.
Never mind.
Go on Dave you can eat more of that.
No they're awful!
I do!
The what?
Oh I could n't take, I'm not gon na.
any more.
Wha what have you done?
Oh.
No, erm.
I'm so I'm sorry Jane which did you want?
You're having that then, these?
Yes Dave.
Alright.
I'll get it.
Yes.
This sort?
I'll put it under the grill.
No we're finished Chris.
There's only two cup matches against war team, I mean th.
Vets Memorial Trophy.
But.
the second team's still playing but we've finished so er.
it's a ni early end to the season.
No it is n't lovely, it's awful!
It's ruined my Saturdays.
Oh!
Drat!
Burnt.
the toast.
No.
Well, it's supposed to adapt to all widths and it's rubbish.
it does n't.
It's.
Mm.
I told you I went and looked that up not long ago, things at that price they only guarantee them for six months.
Yeah but they all went just over a year and we thought.
we thought oh they've just got out the guarantee.
It's not right they were out of it six months before then.
Dave.
Do n't sing while you're eating.
Yeah.
I know what they're for Chris, but I do n't know what he's doing with them.
Well to help.
you on the surveying.
called ranging bows.
Will you do that for me please?
Mm mm.
There'll be three instead of two.
It certainly is.
Do you want me to leave yours a bit longer?
No I do n't think it is.
Well your looks good.
I think all the.
dregs have gone.
Can I.
have some jam?
Chrissy, do you want lots of toast?
Which flavour?
This one?
Can I sit down then?
Dave!
Please!
Mouth closed.
I know you've got a cold but.
Well I'd better check what we have to do it with.
I think I've got all the paint but erm.
Mm.
Heaven help the dentist!
And then, then she.
yeah, she you and she said, oh, you alright?
And you think oh she's marvellous!
Then she says, I'll just clean this bit of tartar off.
After that you think, you right.
I think that's worse than having a filling.
What?
No, love, no it's not.
No she, it's.
Scraper on the back of your teeth.
I've got very sensitive gums cos I've brushed them badly.
for years.
Pardon?
Oh.
What's your plan on the violin front today Chris?
Not really.
David, another piece of this.
Right.
I know.
I know, I've got it all worked out.
No.
That's the next one.
But there's one last in, in this one cos you've had the crust already.
I know it must be you because it was n't me.
Oh!
I'm not, I'm not asking you to eat it Dave, I just wish you did n't pass it across to me like that.
Do you want a bit more?
This finished?
Oh you put that there.
Yes?
It wriggles.
Well it's alive.
Mum will do that for you.
We never said it was.
What newspaper?
Dave!
Chomping away.
Suits me.
I did n't know you were talking about bread.
Well.
Yep.
Fine.
After two dinners now I've had enough.
Mhm.
I'm not interested.
I had that Thursday night.
Yeah.
Mm.
Or Sunday.
Yeah, probably if you want me to get that old mower going I ought to go up to Woods and see if I can get a new drive belt.
Mm mm.
Mm?
Well I like the ride on one because it's easier.
The, the green one it takes hours to cut used to take about three hours for me to cut all the grass with that one.
Mm.
If you'd started the motor and used it it would have helped.
Yes I would think so.
But it's the it's the transporting of it.
I have no trailer.
Not with your mouth full!
I'll have to check I've got all the engine bits, whether I left any at dad's so I can at least stick, bolt.
the engine back together.
Yeah.
I'm never going to do that one.
There's your tractor to do, there's my motorbike to do, and so many other.
things that mower's a.
goner.
Mm.
Yes love.
Well I have n't, have n't had it out this year.
I'm not going to.
Yes I, actually I think it.
I think we have run it once this year.
But er, there's two things Dave.
Number one is, I do n't like using it on wet grass.
The other one, is you and Chrissy getting too big to take you both on it now.
Have to be one at a time now.
And you'll have to ride on the back, you ca n't ride on the tank any more.
You're too big.
More?
Mhm?
Mm.
I was n't meaning that motorbike in any case.
That one goes.
There's another one in there that does n't.
Ah.
No you got it wrong Dave.
I dismantled that car.
It was one your uncle David brought up for me so that I could get take it to pieces to make the car we'd got better.
Took the engine out, the gearbox out.
Mm mm.
Be collector's pieces.
D'ya want any more?
At least you've had one of them in your own bed.
Mhm.
It's your competitive instinct coming out again.
You're trying to win.
Who sha well Michael Mi.
Michael Miles used to do it.
Who was the helper?
Bob Walker.
Hughey Green and er.
I ca n't remember her name.
Oh.
Well I was n't around.
I was at.
Oh well.
Did you do the filters on this yesterday?
Alright.
I think somebody's trying to upset you.
Well no, I do n't know, but.
I would n't er.
they've lined one up at each end of the field so it, it looks like they're saying, well, you know that's a parcel of land.
But, I do n't know.
Go round and ask.
Why not?
Well would you rather do that or have a conservatory?
You do Yes but, you do n't know how much er, I mean, you ca n't sell it for housing at the moment.
He looks always.
strapped for cash.
Well, he must be about seventy.
Do you want my finger with it?
Oh the er the hotel at Gosforth had erm Sky.
And er, you know, th it's, it's spo.
it's sport or films.
The sport was all boxing and erm the film was erm a horror film, but a modern one.
Yeah.
so, I doing, I did the channel flipping and erm every time you went to it somebody else was getting chopped up, drowned.
in that one.
So, I'm not bothered about Sky television if that's what they put on.
You can ring him and ask him what his plans are.
But, do n't forget we need to know your plans as well sunshine.
There's two violins to fit in.
Are you gon na finish this lot off?
Enough?
What?
Okay?
Yeah well, that one's a new cheque book.
This one'll be your Marks and Sparks ' charge card.
Have you used it recently?
Dear me.
Fourteen pounds.
That was at Scunthorpe.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Mrs Gerry, the Bradford Exchange.
That's the.
That plate.
I ordered you the other one, but in my name not yours.
Yeah.
That's right.
Got things like that on it.
No, it's not yours.
A racket is n't it?
I mean, you know, everything's plate one, have you ever seen plate two, three or four or?
Oh!
Michael's alright.
Why?
I mean the plates'll cost pennies to make.
Look at this, all this.
and there's no mention of the price.
Nineteen ninety.
So oh here it is.
Erm.
Well that's a thought.
Erm when we sell that flat we were gon na give Geoffrey and Jean something.
Yeah I.
Yeah, but you get Jean something as well.
Well it's up to you.
That's a better one.
Here's a second plate, it's a lank.
Takes me back to Scampton.
Yeah.
Just when he's.
on the football field.
He can jump.
Steve, the fair haired little.
one.

That was Ian, he does n't work there.
Ian's tall.
But he.
he does n't look anything like him.
Yeah.
They're all nice lads.
Ian's alright, he just gets drunk.
But he's recently married that lass with the ready-made family so.
Steve's, Steve is.
Steve's very pleasant.
He's a nice lad.
He's intelligent as well.
Mm.
It's alright.
Janet should come to work should n't she?
Oh I would think so.
She's got the most abysmal sickness record!
She'll rigid cos her pay stopped at one stage and it was wrong because she had n't been warned.
but erm she did a threw a wobbler about it and.
then when we checked into it.
and you got her sickness record it it was, well it's.
they nearly paid her erm early forties and a spinster.
D'ya know what I mean?
Yes.
Forty one I think.
There you are, you see.
She's, she's, she's typical of the.
of the eight cats.
living on your own syndrome.
So I think it's the cats she catches anything from.
She worries and frets all the time.
It's cos she's nobody to talk to.
Oh!
She, she gets all wound up at home and then comes to work and where there's people to sound off about, everything under the er the sun.
Yeah.
Oh he's a very intense person.
More relaxed.
But.
Yeah.
But it's such a sort of thing.
Well there's a contrast in personality and you do n't really know whether anybody's got the same thing because nobody's narrowed it down.
down.
All they know is that they're.
different.
Yes but.
Oh yes I know.
But they did n't.
they did n't do it properly though.
Course he should.
He tried to do it at home and that was.
ridiculous!
Erm, well the.
Yeah.
I mean Paul said, with the blokes down in London and he, he ga gave them the pills and sa told them that they go back home and so he did.
It was n't, it was n't.
it was n't done right.
Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday.
Oh look!
Oh!
It's te I'll pick it up, i if it it was rust on the.
No, now that I've seen it.
The sheep seemed to have thinned out.
Only two down here.
They're not eating our hedge.
Mhm.
Oh!
I do n't know where granddad's is.
But that was a wispy one, granddad's was ever so big.
With big leaves.
Well everything looks as though it's had a good water now.
Did I tell me when we got up to erm Newcastle we turned on the local news, they'd had five inches of rain which is a winter's rain in four days.
The Metro station just down from Gosforth Park er was flooded to platform level.
And all the overheads were.
Yeah.
And, and everywhere you went the fields waterlogged.
Standing in water all the way up.
Snow on the hills and everything.
But fortunately, you know, we, we only got tail end of it, a bit of sleet.
Erm.
to.
went round the erm British Gas research establishment.
Amazing!
Amazing!
And very impressed.
The it's a massive place and, you know, five or six hundred staff, and erm, it's where they develop all the new technology for the gas fields delivery of gas to your house and everything.
But you see they're spending a lot of the time you know, on developing ways of repairing roads after they've been in them.
And what's impressive is they're doing research that we should have been doing for years!
I mean, it's a bit much when the gas board is there showing us.
how, it's developed materials, it's developed techniques and everything for mending roads.
So it's er a bit humbling.
Yeah.
Quite a lot.
You see when the erm legislation changes shortly, well the legislation is there but when it's enacted erm they they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging and they have to provide us with guarantees.
Yes, but I've, they've got to guarantee the repair for at least two years after they've done it.
So, British Gas, the commercial, have worked out that there's only one way to do that, you do the job properly to start with.
And so, they're putting all the effort into doing it.
And er.
It's.
well that's lost money is n't it?
So no it was very impressive.
I'll I think it's a bit much when you have highway engineers there and really they were showing us how it should be done.
And er.
they proved, you know, some things, certain rollers and stuff that we thought were useless, you know Paddy's dancing partner?
Erm well we thought that was out of fashion.
They've shown that if you run it at the right speed and stuff it's one of the most effective methods of doing it and erm the ones we say are the nice little plate compactors which are the best thing, they are useless in comparative performance so.
er no it was, good.
The money they spend on research!
I forget what it was, the turnover was erm something like eight billion.
Or was it no i er it, probably eight hundred billion.
It was in some figure you ca n't even relate to.
So.
Well I think most of them have.
Oh yes, but the Gas one has.
But I mean th the the standard of entertainment, I mean put, putting.
us all in that hotel for.
Prob probably something like that.
Probably is.
Mm.
Well, there you are.
If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money.
Probably not.
The other thing that was interesting I learnt at dinner on Thursday night is, under the government's legislation within so many years, nineteen ninety four I think, they've got to ha have reduced their market share from the original hundred percent to sixty percent as new firms come in to sell gas.
Now, as the bloke said there, the only way you can do that with people coming in from the outside is that British Gas have got to keep pushing their prices up to make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in.
You ca n't just suddenly say well we're not gon na supply this quarter or something unless there's somebody coming in.
to do it.
To make it commercially attractive to somebody else British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a level, that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes.
it's worth me having a go.
I asked them if once they'd got rid of the forty percent they could then get it back by dropping the prices, you know, they've, they've.
satisfied them legally?
They were n't sure about that.
But, they, they thought they'd probably struggle.
Well, ye I'm not dealing with the marketing people was I?
I was, dealing with the engineering people.
Right.
If you're clearing up I'll go upstairs and er.
Mm mm.
Nothing from the insurance company was there?
You wonder what?
Well it's out of our hands.
It's just very important that.
Yes.
Well they said it was me and Lorna.
Well I that it was you.
I'm not worried about it.
I say it's a compact disc when you have n't got a compact disc player.
it er.
it's a bit of a luxury.
Okay.
Anyway, I'll be down in a minute.
No.
Dave.
Come on.
Get a move on this morning.
Why not?
What?
We're going to do the mower.
Okay?
So I'm gon na fetch it round.
Erm.
yeah, I do n't think I can do the big mower.
I could n't get the right bolts.
And we went to try and get Chris some trainers.
It would n't hurt for some of them throwing away but none the right size of course.
And, so I popped in and asked Douglas if he'd got any going for next to nothing but he does n't have anything down his size.
But we really ought to er.
Yeah.
Well I mean he.
I thought I'd take him into Woollies or the market or something.
Well, do you want to go to Phillips and, I mean he kicks them out in two weeks.
Him and trainers soon.
Pardon?
Yes but.
but, but I mean yes but when.
when you go to a, but th th.
question is, are we getting him quality like you and I would want.
or are we getting him ones that he can kick to pieces?
No you got these ones up in Woollies did n't you?
Anyhow.
Yes.
The mower stuff.
and then, then we'll do that.
Are you helping with that Chris?
Th the mower's out the shed, can you fetch it right the way over here then please?
Well, it's, it's perhaps a bit cool without.
a coat on.
But I would n't describe it as warm.
Bye.

We're just going up to Eastgate Bike Shop to try and get a cable that just snapped.
for the, for the mower.
Alright Dave?
Well we're only going up to Eastgate now Jane.
But we'll see, we probably ought to go somewhere else.
I think you need to go to the toilet Davey, you're wriggling.
Go on.
Daddy says go!
I know you.
Quickly!
Then go back to your game.
And I'll be back in a jiff.
Yep.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Run out of.
I'd like to believe that er.
I know he does.
Do you want to go to bed David?
Why what's up?
Go on then.
Not, not like him to ever want to go to bed truly.
Do you want your tea over there or do you want it.
Ah.
Nothing's boiling.
Well yes, because er A.
if they deliver it it's cheaper than going to Scunny or.
But if, if we go in my car to fetch it I ca n't take the kids.
No, I was n't thinking of any time.
Erm you could take two cars if you want to.
No.
Well I do n't know.
I really do n't know.
Anyway popping into Hull is a thing of the past is n't it?
Well I do n't know.
Ten, fifteen quid I should think.
Mm.
If they'd left one of these out.
when we were down in B amp; Q.
would n't have had to spend those hours.
finding somebody.
Twenty two to, Hardpool Star garden compost.
That's thirty four ninety nine.
B amp; Q growing bags.
The only thing is, you ca n't find them.
They, they wo n't be very good.
Well I called him but I did n't think there was a rush.
The erm.
The B amp; Q conservatory, that one you were in the other day.
which comes in one size, twelve foot four by ten foot two.
Three thousand six hundred and ninety nine.
Not bad.
That's right.
Yeah.
Mm.
He's gon na be a pain in the neck!
I mean there's no intention of letting somebody like that have a go.
I was gon na do it myself.
Well we're not are we?
Hey we're going out and be, we we're going to have them build us one, I mean er my intention is I might get Stuart or somebody to put the bricks at the bottom.
But a it'll, I'll assemble it myself.
I could do the lot actually if it comes down to it.
Yeah!
More than enough thanks.
Chrissy!
Lunchtime.
Stop it.
Stop the mower.
Oh I have n't shown you how to do that.
Chris!
Oh what the heck!
Who?
Well it's not it's not bad what you've done.
Pardon?
Oh no.
. Erm take your gloves and just shake them outside.
No I'll, I'll ha have another go later.
Bye.
Well he's coming in.
David!
Come on!
Hands washed boyo.
Hey!
Who complained?
Either way, that's too late for the kids.
But the thing you wo n't like it, it'll probably be John there.

Well he will be.
and Simon and things.
Yes, well, if you go, if just you and I go we're likely to end up with somebody who knows us.
But you, probably would n't want to be with John.
I would doubt Ruth will be going.
Mm mm.
I do n't know.
I do n't really know what it is.
But I'll read it again.
Hang on.
Well it says, entrants may take part as individuals or as teams of up to four persons.
So we do n't need.
The quiz will contain some sixty questions covering general knowledge and not just railways.
So there is nothing for a family to be afraid of.
What are you an expert on?
Yes, you're not bad are you?
Who do n't?
Oh I should think they will do.
Where from?
Very good.
Very good.
What was his inside leg measurements?
Mm.
Yes, Chris.
But actually he built his first engine, I think, for a quarry in.
That's right.
And where was that?
Yes.
Chrissy's got it.
Mm.
No, no it was n't he put on too many weights sunshine.
The engine was just too heavy.
Er er what?
Well yes be.
because the.
No thanks.
The plate, the plate ways, the railways they had then were built for horses to pull trucks on.
And they di.
they did n't know a lot about steel, they were made out of iron.
And when he built his first engine it was made out of erm iron and stuff and was extremely heavy.
Well not necessarily Chris.
Erm.
It's, it's stronger weight for weight, you see, or well it can be in certain circumstances.
Steel tends to be a bit more elastic.
Iron do iron, certainly the stuff they used then, cast iron, was very brittle and.
so it wo n't stand shocks.
So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast iron railway which wo n't.
which wo n't be made properly.
it'll go and crack it.
But I mean, having said that, there's lots of cast iron bridges around still, lo the one at Stamford Bridge is er.
cast iron and I mean, it's no problem in that situation.
Mm mm.
I just said that.
The one at Stamford?
Which one David?
Oh!
This one here.
No, that'll be steel.
That was only cos you came.
in the, in the sixties Chris it was n't erm so.
So it's a comparatively modern bridge.
The.
there used to be a level crossing there.
Eastgate used to go right through down to join.
erm.
Anderson Street.
But you see that would have given, one, two, three, four crossings on that, within half a mile in Driffield, so they closed that one and put a footbridge over and erm thanks.
Well, that's about right, yes.
So, you can imagine what it'll be like cos erm twenty years ago in the summer, well no, twenty five years ago.
Saturdays and Sundays there would be trains every ten minutes going to Brid.
Pardon?
You've got your mouth full.
Just wait.
Hang on a minute, it's.
Oh excuse me!
That's the damp grass.
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm no they le.
well er, I'm, excuse me David I'm talking to Chris.
Yeah, they're normally every half hour, but.
when it used to be summer Saturdays and Sundays they were excursions, they were n't service trains.
Some weekends like Eas erm, not Easter, bank holidays, August bank holiday and stuff, you'd have as many as they could get in.
And did you know that when, when they used to go to Bridlington you know, you know where the big signal box is at Bridlington, near B amp; Q?
Where the bus, and you know where the buses park and everything, that used to be all sidings right under that bridge that's got the weight limit on.
for storing the engines and the coaches for the excursions.
and they used to get so many.
And trucks Dave.
Well they did n't have trucks for excursions, they did n't take any sheep and cattle to the seaside for a day.
But.
they erm.
they used to, they used to travel them back to Driffield if they were full and keep the empty coaches in two sidings.
It used to be down to Meadow Road.
And they used to keep them there until it was time for people to go out and then they'd run them back up to Brid.
So it was that crowded.
Oh at Brid?
Well he's probably seen the pictures as well but.
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Hot!
I did n't, I just.
gripped it with my hand.
Sorry.
I beg your pardon?
Do you want that piece or do you want me to cut you another?
Do n't be silly!
Mm?
I'm a growing lad.
Do you want it folded?
Or do you want it cut?
What?
Oh erm.
there's one in.
there's one in April, and it might be Easter.
Erm I've a feeling it's the eighteenth.
I there's.
Yeah.
And Easter, whether we're here or not, there's erm I think there's that train coming through here it is the model railway exhibition in York.
That's the big one.
That's at the racecourse.
And there's a swot meet at New Earswick on.
erm the.
Saturday.
And of course the National Art Museum Exhibition reopened.
Well I'll get the afternoon off then, if the kids are off.
Why not?
Well do you want stay at caravan then?
Well I mean.
Yeah I mean lo yo I mean look at now, you could have gone away now.
They've got all their chess sets and things.
Mm.
Yeah but I mean we.
we were just unlucky that was, that was raw.
Pardon?
Mm.
Erm, where I staying this week, Chris, was only about oh ten miles from Morpeth and, you know, not far from Annick and places like that.
Go on David.
Who's her?
Oh oh!
I thought he was telling us about a mountain he climbed.
Ca n't you remember any of those castles up there then Chris that you went round?
Mm.
That's not in the north east.
Bamber?
And erm I went past Beamish yesterday Dave.
Well, it's up there.
Yep.
Well that's right.
That's where I was staying.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
They did?
Do you remember trying to find somewhere to eat in Berwick?
We ended in that pub down the street.
Mm.
Mhm?
No, no, no, no.
Oh yes, like when you drop down onto that bit.
Yes.
Where the Indian restaurant was shut with the windows broken on.
And places your mum does n't want to take me either.
Pardon?
You mean mayonnaise or salad cream?
Which do you want?
There's a what Dave?
Mm.
In Skegness?
The station near Skegness.
But it was n't, it was n't borough?
Does it still have trains there?
You had your, who we who, who were you with?
Not at Skegness?
I've never taken you on Skegness Station.
You've been on the miniature railway.
No.
No.
Mhm.
Unless you go back to the.
Barton?
Barton?
No.
Oh!
Barnetby.
It was n't a cafe Dave it was the Station Hotel.
Well it was a, it was a pub then.
I know.
Now that was the sidings that.
Happy days, eh?
Oh!
A tomato.
Anybody want some more pepper?
Yeah, I understand what you mean David.
Which one are you talking about now?
Er.
well there are some seats that are built set out at different divots.
Anybody want more of this?
Mm.
You realize they'd have been kicking out second helpings.
Mm.
Ca n't do everything on Monday.
Well it's gon na be a bit pushed.

Where did you get the impression that it started at seven?
Seven thirty.
But we have a week to collect the kids from Cubs would n't it?
Oh yes I.
Well ideally.
If you do n't, we'll both stay in.
Oh I should think so.
Well on previous experience er, that's not worth going to.
Who bought this?
Okay.
I can write you a story sunshine, but will you finish your mouthful?
Not if it's like it looked before.
Erm, you can read a book.
Chris.
Go and get the noise machine going.
Come on.
Let's get.

They're not.
Ian and Morna.

I do n't know.
They did n't say.
No.
We.

No Chris.
You get on with the noise machine please.
I'll go put the mower away.
Oh.
Sorry.
Just give me a list and I'll go and get anything.
What clay pits?
Clay pits?
Wha what clay pits.
are you thinking of?
Bill.
and Ben?
Clay pits.
Well usually clay.
clay used to be used for bread making.
Still is to a certain extent.
So lots of places like.
Barton-on-Humber, Burton Stava Broomfleet all had clay pits where they used to dig out the clay and cut it up and make it into bricks.
Is that what you meant?
Here are Chris, look.
Can you see a lamb climbing up a wire fence?
Oh!
It's gone down now.
Chrissy!
Back to the table please.
Mm mm.
Ah, but what you're thinking there is china clay.
Well.
Ah well.
china clay is called kaolin.
and i and it's a very fine clay when it's dry.
And, and, yes they ma use it to make paper and, as you say, to put a thickener in paints and things like that.
Mhm.
Particularly with morphine.

I do n't know.
About.
seven I should think.
Ah it's not important.
Pardon?
First joke, can you please blow your nose?
Come on.
Come on!
You're so blocked up.
Mhm?
You're gon na tell me one are you?
David.
Yes.
I do n't know any jokes.
No, not all of them.
Mary had a metal cow she bought it for a tanner and every morning just at six she milked it with a.
Mm mm.
And then there's the rude one.
Mary had a little lamb, she also had a bear.
But I have n't told you that one David.
You know, I can feel.
Oh well, there you are.
It's, it's the same difference is n't it?
No.
Mm mm.
I was just working out what there was in it.
Why ca n't a locomotive sit down?
Because it's got a tender behind.
Chrissy'll understand that one.
Mm mm.
I thought you were gon na tell me some.
Chris!
Not so vigorous on the scraping please.
Mhm?
A joke from me?
I've told you the ones I know.
Mm mm.
It's dropped it down, I did n't think there was much left.
So when it does I'll know which ones it is and I'll sever it.
Mhm.
Tt!
I ca n't David.
The Avo Avon lady?
What does she do?
Ooh Chrissy!
What a noise!
Pardon?

Mm mm!
Oh!
Well she does n't come here.
No.
Okay.
Thanks Chris.
Cosmetics and things David.
Well they're amusements are n't they?
Well do you, you love bubble bath.
That was n't quite what I meant.
No it's alright.
Give it David.
Do you want some more chicken Dave?
Mm mm.
I can guess.
Mhm?
Who's Lenny Henry?
Oh!
He's not as big as Frank Bruno.
Mhm.
Mm mm.
Do you like Fawlty Towers David?
Mm hmm.
Come on eat up sunshine.
If you're wanting to go out.

I do n't know.
We're not.
Mm mm?
Bald.
Furless teddy.
Oh!
Mm mm!
Mm mm.
Very nice.
Dave, you're making some horrible noises eating.
I know you've got a blocked nose, but really!
Mm.
Well I, I well, I've had two lots thanks Jane, yeah.
Could just about make a a soup for tomorrow.
Yes, but I've got ta meet Marty at one thirty.
So I'm told.
Who's there?
Oh dear me.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.

Oh.
Yes, yes then.
No, oh no David please!
Just, just accept that I said.

Who's there?
Mm mm.
I knew what you were getting at.
Alfie who?
Key locks?
Oh!
Dave.
Less knock knocks, and more eat, eats!
Yes, till next week.
Who's there?
Well sheep who?
So obscure you'll have to explain that one to me.
Not with your mouth full sunshine.
When you've emptied your mouth.
The back bed looks particularly good.
The one.
by the.

Now if you'll excuse me a moment.
I'll just watch the last few laps.
Yes love.
No I'm, just got sitting down again.
If you ca n't, you ca n't so easily if you have n't got a better car.
You alright darling?
Oh you poor thing!
Have you finished violin for today then?
You've no chance have you?
It's Cubs and we're going out, so.
See that car stepping out Chris?
What you've missed it now!
It started to slide.
Have we been topping that up a little?
Or have you just been very careful?
Oh.
No you have those.
Not a large number.
I'm not surprised.
Well they're not very successful gardening gloves are they?
Mm mm.
See two bolters, or whatever that is in.
I know that!
Cos I've got to take these kids up for a bath soon er er you can stay.
down here if.
Why?
You watch it now.
But I'm not bothered Jane.
I'm not bothered about that.
After that?
It'll be bed time!
It'll finish, what half nine?
There's bound to be.
Turbo goes Senna.
Pardon Chris?
Pa.
Well it's happened, before now Chris.
Silly things, like crashing, running out of petrol.
He did indeed.
Oh that's a good picture they've got there is n't it?
That's really constructive.
That looking at a bald head, a stupid girl, and something else.
Oh!
Getting her head in the way of the camera.
Do n't know.
Ran out of steam after eighteen laps.
Well I do n't know.
They do n't do interesting sports.
They do obscure ones like golf.
Oh.
Did you get it right?
But Chris knows.
Here are, look, look, this groupie's getting into everything.
Yes.
Yes he does.
He's got Brazilian on.
We'll go to the favourite bit in a minute Chris.
Your mum loves it.
Standing on the podium and they spray champagne over everybody.
Breaks your mum's heart that, to see all that champagne thrown.
Pardon?
Sorry?
Erm yeah probably he did have.
Looks like the sun was shining there Chris.
Oh she's out there again!
I wonder who was sponsoring the race?
Mm.
We well yes she's.
she's obviously in it for the bet.
Here it comes Chris.
Mum's favourite.
Three bottles.
About Senna retiring.
I want to see all the exciting bits I missed.
This is the highlights.
The full race was run at some obscure time today so.
I was hoping you would n't come.
running through and tell me.
Yes, well that's a.
well, yes sh yes well, this, well this was only the highlights unless the last two or three, no the last two or three parts have been live.
Right.
Chrissy go outside and shake the grass off you now please, off your back.
David!
David!
Yes, tired.
We.
Last time Dave.
David!
Well you have n't asked have you?
Are n't you go.
are n't you going to ring her tonight rather.
than wait till tomorrow?
Then she says no.
Oh no, we're not asking Susan.
Although the money's not important, it's just that you ca n't keep asking a girl that age to come out.
Are you ready?
Are we going upstairs?
Right!
Ooh!
Come on boys.
Yes, course yo.
Come on.
Are you happy now?
It's not hair wash night is it?
Oh I'm not bothering.
Come on!
You do n't worry about that.
Come on!
Get undressed.
Come on.
Do n't.
now I do n't see that's funny.
Oh!
I see!
Well.
in obscure.
Well yo.
Yes love?
I do n't think I want to know.
Mm.
No, I do n't think it was funny.
What did the policeman say his tummy?
I remember that one.
They said, mummy, move yourself!

No.
You were trying but.
it's not very good.
Come on!
Get into the bath.
Try.
the water first.
Course it will be, I did it.
Get in.
Oh.
Right!
Come on.
Get on.
I think you better get a move on, it sounds like your brother's coming.
Alright.
I know.
Ready?
See if your mum can catch.
No.
She missed it.
Oh oh.
Come on sa move it boys!
Mm.
Erm yes.
Is it?
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Very funny Chrissy.
Yeah, very funny.
Right Davey.
What?
Oh oh oh oh.
Right.
Shall I go and get clothes line ready?
Then I can peg you out to dry.
Yeah, and I was trying to listen to that lousy interview.
I did try.
No you did n't, you ran out of petrol.
That's, I was, I was, I was listen I was listening to Neil Kinnock.
promising us this fantastic new world that is n't gon na cost us any money.
And I, and I believed every word of it.
D'ya think?
Yeah.
No.
He's gon na tell you who he wanted to be.

Oh yeah!
That's a really intelligent suggestion.

Yes.
No.
Well in theory, yes.
but in practise, no.
She's dropped out now Chris.
Go on David, get on with soaping now love.
I, I, I think.
Quite so, I think if Kinnock.
if Kinnock gets in you've got an old woman so you'll be right.
Come on David, soap please.
Before your brother gets in.
Come on!
Madame Tussauds.
I do n't know.
Right Jane.
Just watch it!
Behave!
Stop it!
Oh!
Get off.
Ah!
Beg your pardon!
You will be!
That's one thing you do n't say.
Here.
He's erm.
he's, he's put you the bubbles at your end Chris.
Go on down.
No.
You're not staying in here all night tonight.
Come on.
Get on that end.
Oi what?

Right.
Shall we try another one?
Of what?
Do you want one David?
It's a good one.
I know that.
You and your mum too, I know.
Come on Dave!
Use the soap properly, then give it Chris.
No he's not.
He's a silly six.
So, what's.
that, a take-off of the Famous Five?
Mm mm.
Dave!
Stop it!
Come on, sit up.
You've got ta be out in half a second now.
Well that's good.

Right plonker let's do that.
I beg your pardon?
Are n't you?
Here are Chris.
I beg your pardon?
Right!
Bu bubbles from fifty yards.
That's it Dave.
Come on bubbles him.
No, no, no, no.
The more he says no the more you can bubbles him Dave.
Right?
Of course it's fair.
I might turn the cold tap on you.
Come on Dave.
No that's Chrissy's towel.
Sorry.
Wrong one.
Stand up David.
Dave!
Up!
Now!
Now!
Up!
Alright Christopher, you've learnt the clapping trick.
Now come on David, up!
Go on, stop that whistle Chris.
Dave!
Up!
Come on then.
Come on.
Come on.
Chrissy!
Just leave be quiet, leave him alone.
David!
Will you please get up now before I, there's trouble!
No!
You're not stopping in.
Well, that's your fault for coming up late.
Come on.
There, get yourself dry.
Get on with it.
Come on!
No, do it yourself.
Just cos you're brain washed with television advertisements Chrissy.
Mm.
You, you were listening to it on the radio.
I heard you listening and I thought oh she'll probably wan na tell me if there's anything, it's that the warmer airstream or something.
Come on, Chris.
Get on.
Right.
Come on!
Move it!
Yes, but I have n't been to work today.
I.
e I read it yesterday and it was gon na be alright, it said fine.
Pardon?
Yesterday we went.
Go on Dave, get on.
There's a a thing there.
Do you want any more drink?
Nothing.
She said she was just having just the usual drinking gear and er.
eat biscuits, and I do n't, nothing else.
Well you'll have some Kit-Kats or summat wo n't you?
Breakaway?
Come on sunshine, come and sit with me here.
You're ready?
What are you going to do?
Oh light helps you concentrate does it?
Go on then.
Have some light.
Oh right.
I'm coming.
Right.
Now what are you going to show me?
Oh I see.
That's how you set that up to do that is it?
Who showed you that?
Well I did n't know that.
But.
Cor!
Has she?
But, you do n't need a machine to do that.
You can count just like that.
Right.
So.
Yes.
Right.
But you can count in twos.
After twelve?
Then?
Then?
Then?
Then?
Mm.
You're having to think about it.
Off then.
So can you do ninety nines?
Keep adding ninety nines together?
What's two ninety nines?
That's right.
Oh!
No now it gets useful does n't it?
When you're dealing in bigger figures.
than you can do in your mind.
Mm.
Right, read me that number.
Start again.
How do you get that?
I number one is, what does it say at the end?
It says, two, O, seven, nine.
Which is?
What does that make?
I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine but how do you pronounce that number?
No.
No.
If it was that number it would be hundreds.
It's bigger than hundreds, so what's that?
Right.
So how many thousands?
Well you got there in the end did n't you?
Right.
Yeah, very clever.
You can add up in, what are you doing up, in tens?
You can do that.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, ca n't you?
What comes next?
Then?
Ah ah!
Ninety?
That's better.
And add up in hundreds now.
No.
A.
No, start off.
with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you get?
Now you're being a pickle!
Not, not with the machine.
Using your own head.
Add, add hundreds up.
Come on.
What do you start with?
No.
No, no, no, no!
I was, I was n't meaning you to go up in single numbers I was meaning, go up in hundreds.
Start off with a hundred.
Then add, add the same again.
But what's ten hundred?
Right.
So why did n't you say that?
I, I did.
I was expecting you to count, nobody says ten hundred.
Do they?
Then it triggers over into another one does n't it?
Now what were we saying the other day?
You have, units tens, hundreds, thousands.
do n't you?
Mm mm.
So Mrs was showing you how to do this?
What, what else have you learnt to do with a calculator?
If you had four things.
and you wanted to divide them among four people.
how many would each person get?
If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people.
how many would each person get?
That's better.
Now you did that without a calculator did n't you?
Right, now this time do it with the calculator.
So you've got.
Turn it on.
You run out of light?
There are.
Now you're on.
Which figure do you want?
No.
No.
You're dividing.
That one.
Divide by.
Yes.
That's right.
Equals?
Right.
Now that wa that time, that's easy.
That just proves what you already know.
No.
I was going to do more.
Go on then.
Nine, fifty six square root.
Who taught you that?
Just a minute.
Yes.
And so you've discovered.
the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine.
But do you know what square root means?
Well the square root of a number.
is the number which if multiplied by itself.
gives you back the number you started with.
Take, for, the easiest one is four .The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Four four, square root and it gives you two.
Because two times two gives you four.
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Right.
Nine square root is three.
So if you multiply three times three you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen.
the square root is four.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self.
gives you the number.
Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six.
Try and find the square root of six.
What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be.
Do n't, do n't press the button.
Six.
What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?
No.
Three times three is?
No.
Three times three.
Well look three three and three.
So how many have you got?
No!
Plonker!
You've got nine.
Anyway.
So, there you are.
It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half.
Which is n't quite right.
Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time.
That gets very difficult.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You do n't really need that information do you?
So what, what, what sort of information do you need?
Well, if you went out doing your favourite hobby.
Pardon?
Driving an engine.
Now how would sums come into that?
Mm.
You could if they would burn.
Well you co.
Oh I thought you had been.
Shall we turn that off now then?
Well is it the new ones or is it, on the television, or on the radio?
Do you want, no th are you interested David?
Okay, off you go.
I'll come up soon and despatch David.
Oh!
Is this the first part of the news or the second.
bit?
So there wo n't be much more?
Right.
Yes, off you go then.
See you later.
Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're waiting?
So how are you gon na get really clever?
I have n't got time for a lot of stuff.
Don do n't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got Julie coming.
Okay.
Right what do you want?
I've got one sheet.
Right, I've got the green crayon.
Hang on let me just turn the television down.
You you keep your eye on it so that when your tra tram programme comes on we can watch it.
Right.
What to do?
Well you ca n't use these tables.
Do n't let me just move this magazine.
Have I got to write five on mine?
Right.
My green pen does n't write very well.
There you are.
Double add?
I'm not used to double add.
Five plus plus equals.
Equals, equals?
Well this is a bit of a nonsense.
What's that?
One hundred plus plus.
Equals, equals.
Mhm.
Well which way is it?
Does it get harder or easier?
Three hundred.
Oh, three hundred and four.
I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus when you're writing down yourself.
What are you trying to prove?
Mm.
Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but that's a square root sign.
A square root at three hundred and four?
Have n't a clue.
Equals now what do you want me to do with all these?
Oh I'm guessing.
It's alright writing my name Dave but what am I doing?
Mm?
Well it does n't look easy.
Look, I'll do the usual.
Let me write you down some sums.
And you, you can answer them.
Sorry.
I've put an answer in where you do n't want.
There you are.
There's a nice list of sums for you.
Just get on with.
those.
That's it.
Bu yes, you got it right.
I, I should n't have written that.
Good.
Speak up.
Er er, like that.
You know how to do a seven.
Oh here's the tram bit.
Let's fli turn up the sound then we can No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy one.
Here we go look.
Oh look Dave this is great!
Going back to the old trams.
Well trams Dave they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre.
Right.
Oh dear!
The Olympics, not that far away.
Right.
Good.
Ah ah!
That's wrong.
Right.
I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on.
Da David!
You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.
Remember how you do it.
Add the four to the three.
and what do you get?
No you do n't.
Well do it, do it the way on your fingers.
You've got thirteen plus four.
Thirteen Got it now?
Plonker!
Right.
Now let's do this one.
This is, this is easy.
Great!
Now yo there you are now then now getting a little harder but you can do it in just the same way.
So what's the answer?
Yes!
You've got it right.
Now this last one then we'll do something different.
That's right.
Thirty three minus two is thirty one.
That's not bad.
Right what do you want to do now?
Mm?
Right.
Well we can do plenty of that.
Have you cleared up all your toys and everything before Julie comes?
Well then why is it still out?
And have you cleared up everything in the dining room?
Mm mm.
Well shall we go through and do some clearing up then?
Come on.
Go and put these pens away and the paper please.
Not tonight we wo n't.
There's not gon na be any more time.
Go put those away please.
Off you go.
Right.
Now you said you were gon na tell me what's happened on the news so far.
Oh dear!
What's open the day after tomorrow?
Oh it's closed now is it?
Aha.
What else has been happening?
Yes.
Yes.
Well a lot of people do that.
It's very dangerous.
They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop.
Be.
No, they're supposed to stop before the lights.
Silly!
Because, on a lot of those the train.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
That's right.
So.
Mhm.
And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you.
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come.
Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield.
Er.
they've got full barriers you see.
Well, they're different because they have them they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're.
controlled by a television.
Er.
Oh yes.
That was good was n't it?
Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box did n't you?
Yes.
That's right.
Well I did n't know they were trying to get rid of those.
But some of the crossings around this area did n't have any barriers at all.
and they just had the flashing lights.
That's right.
Ah well tha no Meadow Road's got the old gates but at Natherton there were some that did n't have any barriers at all, they were just flashing lights.
Now, do you remember now let's think whether you were born.
When the Lockington railway disaster happened that was just a few miles from here.
No, Lockington.
And that was where er, a train came off the railways when it hit a van on.
on the crossing er and killed a lot of people.
Oh!
That's sa surprise cos I was on the way to Hull oh yes!
You were around because I was going to take you and Chrissy to Hull to a train fair.

and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash.
Well it was one of those things was n't it?
Mm mm.
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we were n't sure what it was.
It happened just after we went past the, just before.
You could see er a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards.
the crossing.
Mm mm.
No I could n't.
But erm when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened and we went to the toy fair and then we came back and there was er you could see all the ambulances and everything still there.
And the train was there leaning over.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Onto the side I think.
It was erm well what do you think it would be?
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the old sort of diesel multiple unit.
Can you?
Mm.
I'm pleased you know your trains.
Yeah.

if you let him though he'll, he'll stay up all night and read to you and things like that, but no, just send him to bed.
I do n't mind if he reads for a few minutes but that's it.
Chrissy will come in, he might come in bringing Simon and his mum.
You know Fran bri.
brings him home?
And the last two weeks they've come traipsing in to swap.
to swap Megadrives.
Anyway.
No, but if Fran walks in, if Fran walks in they'll just put, they'll put a toy on and they'll take it out.
