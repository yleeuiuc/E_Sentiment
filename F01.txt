I'm sure he knew we were trying to get rid of him because he would n't go!
He just stood there.
He's looking at us, probably thinking I think and you know my cousin, Lee?

And my cousin's sitting with a spider mhm nice little spider nasty!
I can understand like you picking one up to get rid of it if you're not scared of it, but playing with one, keeping it as a pet!

She knows Jane and that lot.
And she's a bit of a slag.
She do n't really, you know, I mean she's got a bit of a reputation.
I suppose everyone has but I hear about her a lot.
In school and everything.
Pardon?
The skinny one.
But, like Geraldine's two-faced cos she's always giving it like erm, to other people, I do n't like Lucy, the one she hangs about with, I only hang about with her cos I feel sorry for her.

Gone and spoilt her hair, man.
She was so pretty, innit?
She was getting tall, nice blue eyes and then she goes and does that.
It looks alright, but it looked better when it was long.
Not when it was permed, just when it was long and blonde.
And Kelly's looked better when it was short and curly.
Shave off the head.
Who?
Kelly?
Yeah.
Think so.
She's got a reputation too.
I mean, the difference is, I've never heard anything about Donna, do you know what I mean?
Nobody's ever said but with Kelly, people have said things to me.
With Ian?
I mu I mean I must admit, must admit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Late I must admit lately I have n't seen her with, I have n't.
have n't seen her with him.
I must admit.
But I have n't seen her with him for ages!
And I have n't really seen his car a lot lately either.
If I think about it I have n't seen him at all.
I have n't seen him at all.
An I saw Kelly about two week's ago, no, about a month ago.
Yeah, I think so yeah.
She hangs about with some erm half-ca I think she's black but she, she's light.
I do n't know if she's half-caste but.
but she liv I saw her Nan the other day and like her Nan, I do n't cos her Nan always invites me round.
She goes, come round and see me!
I goes, with Kelly?
I do n't talk to Kelly no more.
I goes, she goes, yeah, you two were really close and then you just, her Kelly, her Nan does n't obviously know that Kelly's a little bitch, do you know what I mean?
Cos it was Kelly that like, said, yeah, you're my best friend, do you know what I mean, and then made me say Kelly's my best friend, do you know what I mean?
Cos I used to look up to her cos she was older than me.
So I do n't think her Nan really knows that Kelly does it to loads of people, do you know, cos she was Geraldine's best friend, Katie's best friend.
She was.
I do n't know she just, she, she goes you're too immature.
Cos you know how I hang about with you lot a lot when I was younger and we used to like climbing roofs and everything, she goes you're too immature.
She started this water fight with Kevin, she was throwing wet tissue at him and cos I got good at it she goes you're too immature.
I goes right then.
She goes you'd better go.
I said yeah I will.
And I walked out and then she did n't call me and I did n't call her and that was it.
Simple at that.
Cos my Mum would n't let me call her.
She goes you're not calling her up again.
No way!
She looks like she's desperate.
No, but Donna, Donna, it looks alright on Donna, but Kelly just looks Been going Georgie's lately getting all posters off of him.
I got erm, Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Universal Soldiers and and he was offering me all Jean Claude Van Damm ones.
You know the one where her top's ripped open you can see her leg.

He was offering me that one.
And he's got all nude pictures.
There's me, I was going, you dirty man!
I goes you hang it up in your shower, innit?
He goes yeah.
He goes do you wan na come and see?
Listen to me, I goes no thanks.
Such a pervert!
He's always got young girls in there with him.
I wan na know what he does!
But he's always.
Here, I mean I've seen like, ten-year-old girls in there, but really pretty ten-year-old girls, you know what I mean, blue eyes and blonde hair from them flats.
And you go in there and they give you dirty looks, you know.
And you're looking at a video and they sit there looking at you like that.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think I have.
I do n't like it when they're sitting on the floor in front of the counter with their legs like that and they're sitting there and you're looking at the video and you think, well, I ca n't get that because that was made in nineteen-eighty-six and they might think I'm a bit weedy, so I better get something that was made recently.
That's why when I, when I go round the video shop on my own I usually go Jordans.
Cos I do n't like going in there on my own I feel intimidated.
He's alright to talk to but he's such a little pervert!
You see him, cos he's, Nick goes can I have a poster? no, they're only for erm the prettiest girl in Clapton and he shook my hand and sort of giving it yeah, before he drags me behind the counter!
But he had all these nudy pictures.
Because I wanted Aliens three.
If you can get an Aliens three poster for me I'll pay you for it.
One where the Alien's at her face.
But erm, and I was looking through all these posters and most of them were of nude women!
And I said, George, ai n't you got any nude men?
I said because at least you could have some nude men for me!
And listen, he goes, yeah, I've got nude men hanging up in my shower, he goes, do you wan na come?
That was what he said, he said they're hanging up in my shower, do you wan na come and see them?
Listen, I goes, yeah, anytime.
Cos Shelley was there.
And Shelley was a joke, man.
She goes in there, she's sitting looking at him like that, she just stares at him.
Just to make sure, you know what I mean?
When anyone's like that with me or with one of my friends she just sits there looking at you because, cos she's big, she's kind of threatening sometimes, you know what I mean?
She's sitting there with a fag hanging out her mouth.
She just sits there staring at him saying you make any funny moves you'll see what you get.
Oh Shelley's She's erm, she's on a diet.
She's lost about three stone.
It's good.
I mean, you probably would n't see it but I can see it, she's losing it.
Cos she's quite pretty actually if she lost weight.
I'm gon na get her to go jogging with bin liners strapped to her bum!
I could listen, I'd go, why's her bum so crinkly, like, when Jane comes.
This is Jane, she's got a bin liner to make her bum sweat I thought she needs it.
I do n't know why your sister bothers she's alright.
She just needs to cut back on her chocolate.

Did you see French and Saunders do it?
It was good that.
Innit?
When he takes the man's face he puts it, ah, it was so bad!
I.
I'd just read the book as well.
The book's better than the film cos it's got more detail in it.
But that was nasty man, he wants to make her tit Urgh!
And when he's dancing he takes his clothes off and, and he's pinned up and he's going like and he's going.

He goes, look, I'm breaking its leg and he's going precious, precious!
I could n't stop laughing.
The little dog's going This little dog was mad, man, did you see it?
It was so ugly I would've.
kicked it if I saw it.
Same as Chris's chihuahua.
I'd, I'd love to kick it.
I'd love to kick her dog.
He's so tiny!
I feel so sorry for it you know, up at that house with all them big fat balls of, of fat.
They've probably stepped on it enough times.
And have you heard it crying at night?
Right, on the balcony I can see it ruff, ruff,.
Yeah, I do n't think they keep it out there all night.
But it's out on the balcony a lot.
Cos I'm in bed right, cos sometimes I go, in the week it depends how I feel like, tonight I'll probably go to bed about about half-ten or eleven cos I'm gon na watch Ruby Wax and sometimes.
Della!
I hate that when my dog does that when he do n't listen to me and somebody else calls him.
But tonight I'll prob tomor like yesterday I went to bed at about ten and you can hear it calling out, crying out there.
I have to go to bed early and then Mum gets me up in the morning she's going get up!
First my alarm clock.
goes off.
and Mum goes get up!
And I, I use, I like.
Innit? and, and it's all, like when you get in at night it's.
and then you get in the morning.
and it's all warm and, and you get out.
and it's freezing even in summer and you just have to get under them blankets for another five minutes!
cos my alarm clock goes off at half-seven, it goes cockle-doodle-doo!
And you push it and she goes good morning!
And you go shut up!
And then my Mum goes, eight o'clock I still ai n't up, my Mum goes get out of bed.
get out of bed.
Innit?
You have to go miles!
Here's my Mum, she goes, get out of bed.
Get out of bed.
Get out of bed!
Or she gets the kitten and puts it on my face and the kitten sits there going get off me!
Or you get Sam going can I play your gameboy?
Boosh, round your head!
And you're going yes.
Can I break your computer?
Yes, break it!
Leave me!
Easter, eight o'clock, half-seven my brother and sister are looking for Easter eggs in the house.

Thanks.
He's putting them on the side, like, I'm asleep in bed, he goes this one's for you.
Thanks.
He's just putting, just putting, I got three eggs, I was just putting them on the bed I could n't be bothered with them then.
Thanks, just put them down.
Cos I do n't really like chocolate.
You, I'll bring up some of my eggs, you can have some of them cos I do n't really like, I only like chocolate bars I do n't like chocolate.
he goes, this is for you this is me, thanks.
Just put it on the side That's rude.
All right, Moss?
It was funny though was n't it? just taking them, it was good, it was so funny.
And you know Easter after the two weeks, right?
I could n't get up!
On Monday to go to school I could not get up!
Cos you know my,.
my brother and sister went away for the week, right,.
on Sunday.
Can you imagine my flat for a whole week to myself?
You should've come and knocked for me cos you could've come in and played computer and everything.
I, cos I go to, Monday Tues yeah, Monday Kerry come down.
and he was playing computer with me and I meant to come up to you.
Cos usu when they go away, cos they're not going away this weekend, but when they go away you should come down cos the flat's quiet and I ai n't got nothing to do, sit and play my computer.
And it was just so brilliant!
I could leave everything lying about on the floor and nothing would get broken!
I could leave a Madonna tape in the middle of the room and no one would rip it!
I'd sit and watch it, you know, just put it there, sit and watch it.
It was brilliant!
I could watch telly and actually hear what Jim was saying in Neighbours.
It was amazing!
I've never, I've never ever heard Jim's voice before.
Never!
Cos every time Jim talks.
or my sister gives it Sam!
Let go of my hair!
And he's pulling her EastEnders today this child is mad!
You know them hopper things you bounce on, the round balloon thing?
She's got one, it's flat, it's not flat but it's kind of deflated, she's getting er, doing handstands on it and she's going my head, it's my head.
My brother's, my brother's doing a handsta er sitting on his head on the chair.
He's going, Jo, do n't leave me on my head all night, and I'm going, shut up!
And Mum's going, do n't talk to him like that, and I'm going, they're driving me mad!
They get up at eight o'clock in the morning and say, Jo, I want my cereal.
And you say how many Weetabix do you want, one?
No, no, no, two.
Sam, how many Weetabix do you want, one?
Make up you bloody mind!
And say I want Rice Crispies You pour the Rice Crispies no, no, Cornflakes I do n't want no sugar on them today.
I do want sugar, I ca n't have them now they've gone all soggy in the water, in the milk!
Oh god!
You just want to tell them to go home!
Go, go away from me!
You're so lucky!
Yeah.
But I like, you know the weekend, Saturday?
I love getting up, I like, I used to like getting up Saturday cos the cartoons were on.
But when Sam I could put it on in the bedroom and sit and watch it and Sunday, I get up on Sundays and that that cat's ugly I get up Sundays now because Grange Hill's on.
Have you seen it?
The.
first ever series of Grange Hill with.
Mark out of EastEnders.
I get up to watch that now cos I, and The Rut, The Rug Rats, the little baby and his, I think that's so funny.
It's a little cartoon, it's just cheap and enj like Bart Simpson kind of.
Have you seen it?
It's kind of stupid but it's kind of funny if you know what I mean cos the baby do n't talk and as soon as the Mum and Dad's out of the room it's let's go and find the chocolate.
It's so funny.
But oh, erm your dog's attacking a car I just thought I'd tell you.
Shadow.
Oh that's good, cos Dempsey'll stay in there for ages now if she pisses all over there.
Dempsey, oh, cos by the wall, right, and you know how he digs up the floor.
when he's finished?
I walked past, mouthful of dirt!
Where Dempsey's kicking dirt up in my face so I go, what're you doing?
Looks at me and he goes I hate him so much!
Innit?
And they're just looking at you!
And they're just looking at you and your Mum s your Mum wants you to take him out properly, walk him down the street and you've sneaked him outside and they're just looking at you like this.
With that, with that expression and like when a cat you go puss puss puss to a cat.
and you're calling it for ages but you ca n't go near it cos it will run away and it goes like this to you, it goes.
and it goes like that and it goes.
yeah, and it cuts its eye at you and then you go to get it, it goes I'll jump, I'll bloody jump.
I got a cat trapped up here, right, it was chasing Jones and I goes I got you now, and he jumped over the wall.
From here, listen, I goes I've got you now.
This is the cat over the wall and I hate, Jones always.
Mm?
Yeah!
I it, and it jumped back up and, it did n't jump back up, it jumped, what it done is it ran down that bit of the wall and jumped.
And Jane, this is Jane to me the other day, throw your kitten off my floor and see if it lands on its feet.
I hate it cos when I call Jones she stands on the wall like that, right.
She's sitting down.
and you go to her and she just looks at you like, I'll come, and you go, and you go closer.
and you go Jones, come here and you come here!
She goes like that, she cuts her eye at you, right.
She'll go up to you and she goes she looks at you like that and her eyes are all wide, sh sh she's looking down at the wall like that to make sure it's all clear, you know what I mean?
She's going she's looking at you and you go, come here, you take a step further and she gives you a dirty look and then she waits until you're that close and then she jumps!
So the other day, you know what I done?
I jumped over the other side of the wall, so if she jumps she'd have to.
I walked up to her, you know what she done?
She jumped the other way round and ran all the way round the back.
I hate cats!

That was, that was what erm Dempsey done to Jane and Mussy.
You when American Werewolf come on T V for the first time?
And you got ta admit that was scary, that film, even.
when I watch it now I get scared, especially the bit when she goes like that and he goes aargh I get, I get scared.
Yeah.
Right, well, you know how Dempsey used to scratch on the door?
Well we were n't in and Dempsey always used to go up to Jane, right?
So Mussy and that lot had just watched American Werewolf and they hear outside.
Oh no.
Della!
Come here!
wag it?
Goes to say.
Do n't beat me!
Innit?
And here's me, I'm looking at him, she's going you're so cool you beat your dog, innit?
I do n't.
It's the kitten I beat up!
You know, I pick the kitten up I throw it in the air, catch it,.
I go like that with it wooo!
I get her head, put it in my mouth.
I get her head and you know Beetlejuice when he goes I got ta show you it cos sometimes she's, she's not alert and when she's like that it looks wicked cos he goes and her ears are like that she goes and I get her to play the banjo and she goes it's wicked!
I just get her arms I go like that with her arm, right, and she just lets you do it, she just looks at you and says you're fucking mad and walks away.
You're playing with her right, and then you've finished and you put her down and she looks at you she goes, bloody sick!
She walks away and poufs her tail out like that.
You think go away, you mutt!
I hate animals.
I hate Nicky and Squeak as well.
Nicky just sits there giving it Squeak's face, Squeak grabs her foot Squeak goes they start tumbling all about the cage, you can hear boof, boof, boof!
Yeah, but they always fight.
You know how we used to always fight and then, well they turn round, I did n't mean to smash your face in.
It's alright, Josie, I did n't mean to break your arm, do you know what I mean?
And then Squeak's so sneaky, I probably told you this where she gets Nicky and starts cleaning her.
Nicky loves it when Squeak cleans her, right, my rats and she gives it and Nicky's getting all and there's Squeak going.
in her neck and then, and then it's all quiet right.
Say you're sleeping in the front room, as soon as you turn the light out and there's no sound they do n't shut up.
I'm sure they pick things up and throw them at each other.
I swear they're so loud it's like it's like you know when you kick through a big pile.
of, big pile of leaves, it's like that.
Trying to sleep through a hurricane innit?
It was nasty.
It was like that night when I woke up and the hurricane was there, I could n't turn my lights on or nothing I was shitting myself.
Yeah.
Remember when that tree fell down and it banged on Shelley's window and Shelley was giving it ah!
And Shelley come back with a knife.
She goes I'm gon na kill Mussy!
No this is me, I was sitting in my bedroom cos I did n't, Sam and Fern were n't there innit?
I was in the bedroom on my own.
And I could hear and I could hear and I turned the light on and it would n't come on!
And my hands were going like this and I looked at my clock and it was about six o'clock and it was still pitch black because it jump back into bed.
As simple as that.
I got back into bed, put the quilt over my head, turned over, I went to sleep.
I did n't even bother wake up when the alarm clock went I just left it ringing.
My Mum had to come in and turn it off.
Same as when Thriller first come out.
I had to sleep with the light on.
So Mum she come turn it off But man, no when the hurricane come and Shelley come back with that knife, I'm gon na kill Mussy, I'm gon na kill Mussy.
Shelley, we're trying to eat our cheese on toast.
I said I'm gon na kill Mussy.
I'm gon na kill him.
You know he, he kicked her, she come back sitting there with a knife, I'm gon na kill Mussy.
That was funny.
I've got ta show you that picture, it's that big, across the leg all blood dripping down off it.
Rufus just went looked like a vampire attacked her.
Dempsey had tried to take on two dogs that he knocked out his tooth.
Knocked out his big canine tooth.
He's only got one now.
You know the big.
he's only got one now.
He tried to take two dogs on.
Just, the dog just went knocked its collar and the tooth dropped out.
cos he's got brown teeth as well.
I'm not brushing Dempsey's teeth he'll bite my hand off!
This is the vet to me he goes your dog's got brown teeth you got to brush it brush the teeth banged his tooth with the collar, he had a metal collar.
Dempsey's tooth there's all blood coming out of his mouth I said see, serves you right.
sympathetic cos he was kicking the shit out of him.
Stupid dog!
And he tried to attack a pit bull.
Pit bull.
Round the shops.
He had a long-life lead on and I tried to grab the long-life lead it burnt all my hand and he tried to attack the pit bull.
Luckily the man had the pit bull on a lead.
Kicked the shit out him.
I kicked him home I swear.
I kicked him and the long-life lead just come I kicked him again.
Bastard.
That's what they do in that film.
The dog bends over.
Shelley blows smoke in her dog's face.
Yeah.
She gets a smoke cos her, her brother smokes stuff and sometimes he gives it to her and she blows it in her dog's face.
And then she tried to put it in the washing machine for a joke and the dog was gon na get in.
The dog's so stupid.
Shelley's dog does that anyway.
That's what Roy done, you know why, he come into my house and I goes you better not come in my door he'll attack you.
And he goes, no I wo n't.
I let him use the toilet.
I goes, you better get out now and I tried to hold Dempsey back and he goes, he goes, that dog wo n't bite me, dogs love me.
Dempsey run up bit his leg open.
He went and all his leg was bleeding.
I goes you better get a tetanus cos God knows what Dempsey's got.
That's like some boys done in my school and they got caught and then they were n't allowed to go to the disco.
And they had big rocket things and they were throwing them.
One of them just missed the teacher's head.
And they brought them flick-knife combs.
You know when you flick them out and the teachers took them off of them.
Cos they said, one boy, a boy, a police officer the other times thought he saw a boy with a knife and he shot him.
So they took it off of him.
They thought they were all smart.
That cat wo n't come in, she never comes in the stupid bitch!
She just sits there at me.
When your dogs were chasing her.
Teachers, teachers,.
all the teachers got drunk on the first night in France.
They come in singing out about twelve o'clock.
And they took all the shandy out of the machine.
They told the people in France.
I do n't.
know why, just shandy.
So then they would take the shandy out of the machine cos we were listening, cos everyone kept drinking all the shandy.
Cans of drink were naff expensive over there out of the machine!
Those stingy cunts.
I could n't speak French if I tried.
No one could speak French on that French trip not even the teachers.
That's so stupid, innit?
Yeah, there was one French teacher who wanted to come, they would n't let her come.
They had a Spanish man there and another teacher, none of them spoke French.
Nobody spoke, Mr spoke a little bit of French but he spoke Spanish fluently.
I mean I knew just as much as him.
Bonjour, Au revoir!
I do n't know, know, the man who owned the hotel we were staying in knew English.
We did n't get food anyway we just eat French bread all week!
They made some shitty food!
Their cheese stunk like You know how sweaty socks stink?
Real bad sweaty socks.
The cheese stunk like that.
How can you eat food that stinks?
And they had all this on top of it and everything, so everyone just eat bread.
Just bread!
That's all we got, bread and water.
We got bread, no we got bread and then the only time we got chips was in the middle of the week.
You should've seen people yamming down their chips.
I've never seen people eat chips, cos you know how you get sick of chips sometimes, we's shovelling down the chips down and coke, proper coke they were drinking.
I'd have been shitting myself!
You lot waste out all my tape, that's good.
Where, where, wh Boys ' Club?
When we went camping, the girls are n't so depressing.
The girls and the boys all camping together.
Some girl's going out with a boy, he zipped her tent up over them and she was so shocked she pulled her trousers down by accident.
She had nothing on underneath.

It was her body?
Right.
So when he jumps into her, what's the difference?
No, no, but I know that, but I'm saying that that's what I meant, that's what I meant.
So really she was n't dancing, she was dancing with Patrick Swayze's spirit but she.

She does kiss him at the end.
She does kiss cos we were talking about this in science.
She kissed him.

I said no that.
Patrick Swayze's dead!.
It's cos he.
And I was, I was laughing and it, everyone was going because it was Patrick Swayze but I was still seeing Whoopie Goldberg!
So I was laughing, I just thought, this is stupid!

Who watched Ruby Wax last night?
Did you watch Ruby Wax?
She's wicked!
Did you watch Ruby Wax?
No.
Did you see Ruby Wax?
She she pushed, there was like ten men in a, like, six men in a row.
She pushed the first one and they all started to fall face down.
Do you know what I mean?
And she started running.
She ran to the end of the queue and when the man fell flat, face down, he fell on top of her and she was going like that to the camera.
Yeah, did, they, did, Joanna Lumley was supposed to, like, her husband was supposed to have left her and she was going mad, drinking and everything, right.
She was drinking vinegar!
Squeezing it down her throat and everything.
All these men started dancing with her and she could n't believe it and she started dancing with them, right.
And then sh like, you know how sometimes in the, an old dance routine they put a coat on the woman and everything, she's dancing and they bring this coat towards her and she goes like that and it's a straight jacket.
Cos she's gone mad and they put it on her, right, and they, they're holding her and they're tapping out of the stage sidewards and she's sort of like going like this, she, she, thinks all these nice men'll love me and then like at the end of the show you see them, they're tapping her out of the studio and putting her into a van and she's still wearing a straight jacket and smiling at you.
No.
But she was cooking and she was going you take, she goes, she goes, some people like it a little bit on the side, you know, with their food, some people on the side.
My husband wanted a little bit on the side.
She goes, she goes.

You know when the two men yeah they go, he goes like that at the end and then this week they went there's no business like show business at the end.
No, you know when it, the video, there's two men on the fair ride, have you seen it?
And they're kissing each other.
They're not kissing each other, he goes like that, he put his arm round the other man and he kisses him like that.
No, it's two men, innit?
And he puts, he puts his arm round him and he goes like, he's got his arm round him and squeezing him like that.
He do n't kiss him.
Kissed him on the cheek.
It was just bad enough having their arm round each other.
Two men with their arm around each other.
Do n't like that.
Cos it's only verses and then they go young at heart and then they go.

It's a bit boring though.
Boring.
Here you are, Jane!
What was that Stephen?
Good.
Good.
Good.
He never knew I was an informer.
Miss!
Miss.
you've cracked it again now.
Do n't.
it breaks.
Yeah.
Well, as far as I'm concerned Nick's a cunt.
As simple as that.
he he's he, he's a he's a user and he ca n't take it when he's dumped and he ca n't take being told the truth, like he's an idiot.
And he likes to talk about you.
And you know the thing, no wait a minute, the thing that gets me is you know when James fancied me?
Right, now it was obvious James fancied me.
Now all I wanted was for James to ask me out and I would've when out with him you know.
But Nick got in there first.
But what pissed me off was, right,.
No, no, no, no, nothing like that.
What pissed me off is, is he's hanging about with James and that lot now right, but when you talk about James and that lot to him its, oh they're a bunch of chiefs.
Do n't, no do n't say anything because he comes back to me, it comes back onto me.
It do n't matter whether you say I wo n't say anything cos it always comes back.
But he thinks Cathy and that lot are going to he thinks Cathy's a slag and everything, yet he's still hanging about with all you lot.
He's gay.
I really, no he really pisses me off.
and he's just using James and that lot.
Cos I never say, I mean I do n't,.
I do n't me I mean I like James and that lot.
I think all of that lot are alright.
Peter's, but if I think Peter's a bit of a tosser I tell Peter to his face, he's a tosser.
blurgh! spat them all out.
On, off the floor?
And Nick had chewed it all up?
No what happened.
she must've been holding it in because she did n't wan na wipe her bum with her hand and then you know it just burst out before she could get to the toilet.
I mean I remember when I went, first went to my cheap caravan site where there is n't a toilet and you have to walk to the toilets, and I remember a couple of times when I was little, shitting my pants on the way to the toilets, you know, cos I could n't hold it in.
But when you reach this age you should be able to control it!
Dirty Cath!
Oh, you did n't shit your pants, did you?
It's like when you piss and it's really bad, it's really bad and then you get to the toilet and it's that's why I like that bit in, have you seen A League of Their Own?
Where he comes in and he does that piss and he's and Madonna's standing there looking at him like this and she's just looking at him and she's going, anyone who can keep it up that long and he's just sitting there going er no he's going er and she's going, she's going, and she's coming round like that trying to look at him, I could n't stop laughing.
And the piss was going on for ages.
Janice goes, it was n't good.
A League of Their Own.
She said it was n't as good as good as they thought it was gon na be, everyone told me it was brilliant.
I said, I do n't care what people think I, I think it's brilliant.
No, I think it was brilliant.
It's the sort of film you can sit and watch a few times.
Well I know I can.
You know what I mean i, that's what I mean, it was, it was n't predictable, do you know what I mean?
And it was, I mean, right, things like House Party and all that lot white man Malcolm X, they're all black films.
If the truth be known.
And that's why I like Candyman.
Shelley said that was crap.
Grace thought it was brilliant.
Why?
The thriller man in it is a black man.
It's not that they're being racist.
I mean, I, I agree with them there's hardly any leading roles for black people but.
And Whoopie Goldberg and they're brilliant actor.
yeah they.
But that's, but that's what I mean, they're making, they're saying let's make, when the white people make films black and white people watch them, they're not specifically made for white people, not specifically made for black people, it just happens to be white actors.
But when they make a black film, they make a black film for black people to sit and watch.
I've got it all on this tape Malcolm X, Kerry's saying Malcolm X is brilliant, he was a black man, he was a nigger and Truno was going shut up Truno's black too and she was going shut up!
Malcolm X, stupid black nigger, do you know what I mean.
But because they're black it do n't make no difference, do you know what I mean.
But if I was to say it, it's different.
Like, Kerry goes to me, cos I've got a black kitten he goes, what are you gon na call it?
I goes dunno.
Goes call it Malcolm X.
I goes shut up!
He goes, call it, call it Ma call it Martin X and then he says call it Nigger.
I think Nigger's a good name but, you know what I mean like, come here Nigger!
But it's, it's racist.
If I'd a, if I were walking down the street going Nigger! sorry!
Mm.
He's a legend, man.
Bob Marley was brilliant.
Yeah, they should n't, they should n't cos his music was made for that time.
That was, the music was made for his, that time, you know what I mean, it's not for this time.
But I hate people I, I hate people that are, I hate people that are biased, like the new Madonna book.
That book's disgusting!
It's a disgusting book, she should n't have made it.
Have you seen it yet?
I wan na see it.
Do you know, I hate people that do that.
They're saying it's disgusting but they wan na see it.
Body of Evidence.
Body of Evidence is disgusting film.
I wan na watch it.
You know what I mean.
Yes, that was brilliant!
Whose seen,.
who's seen, who's seen Basic Instinct?
It is so crap I do n't know what it is.
It is a sexist stupid perverted film, I watched it round Nick's house.
No, no listen to this, listen to this, right.
There's no nudity of men right, it's all nudity of women, like when Sharon Stone sits there with her legs her open and she ai n't go no knickers on.
It's all nudity of women.
There ai n't one decent man in it, only Michael Douglas.
He was nicer when he was young but kind of now, he's kind of old, do you know what I mean.
Exactly.
There's no decent men in it and there's no nudity of men it, even when he's in it all you got to see of him was waist-high, you got to see a clips of his bum.
It was such a se it was, it's, the only bit that was worth be seeing was the beginning bit when she's fucking a man she sticks an axe through him.
A pick, an ice pick through him.
Do n't bother watching.
In fact I'd wait four days, I'd wait four years to watch it on T V it's so crap.
Janice thinks it's brilliant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh Alan, ooh Alan.
She's pathetic.
Like it really, that film really pisses me off right, when he's beating her up and he rips her knickers off and fucks her up the arse and Nick's going that's how to treat a wo it's disgusting fucking a woman up her arse, and ripping off the woman's knickers and rip putting it up sitting watching it thinking.
The difference is with Body of Evidence is it's Madonna whose in, it's a woman whose in control.
It's a woman whose using a man.
It's a woman that's taking advantage of men, that's good.
That's why I wan na see it.
Body of Evidence?
It's, it's a woman!
Yeah, it's the opposite of Basic Instinct.
It's like, with Sharon Stone, even at the end she was still dependent on Michael Douglas, like, when he was going she was crying and she could n't kill him at the end cos she loved him so much and, you know what I mean, so no, Body of Evidence, it'll probably have a rubbish end and she'll probably marry the lawyer or something, but it was still good to see her beat, tying a man up, putting candle wax on him and shit.
Oh, it was brilliant!
He's so cute!
I think I've fallen in love with Rick Mayall now.
You know, you know what bit made me laugh?
You know the bit when they're out in the garden and he goes, he goes, why are you back?
She goes, cos I'm, I'm erm, she goes, erm, cos, no, cos you're not happy.
And he goes, well get happy!
And he gets the spade and hits her on the head with it and he goes, I never want to talk to you again and he kicks her in the head.
I could n't stop laughing.

Yeah, he went oh!
He goes, who put that there?
And the bit where he goes.
He goes urgh, cobwebs and she goes piss off!
She goes Mum, come and sit here, she goes, piss off! like that and the mother goes you talking to me?
And she goes And the little girl!
Dog pooh! wipe it on the sides a doo di doo di doo I loved the way he done that!
And you know the bit where erm she's in bed and the hand comes out from behind the pillow and it goes over the back of her head and she goes, she goes, she was so cute she goes, she goes, what a pile of shit! and when, you know when she cleans up all the cornflakes?
She's sitting there, she's putting it all in and she goes, she goes and she goes and she goes, yeah.
Yeah, and she stands, she's going, she's going, on the way I caught cornflakes disease aargh!
I know, he goes, I do n't love you, you know.
He goes I'm an alien, I'm going into space but on the way I caught cornflakes disease aargh!
You know when that comes on telly again?
Can you tape if for me?
You tape it me and give me the tape and I'll give you a tape in exchange because I wan na keep it.
Thanks, Kate.
I'll bring one in on Tuesday, in case, but if it comes on on the weekend I'm gon na tape it.
No, it's on Sky.
It's been on Sky.
Yeah, and he's going, oh, he's going, he's going, he's going, snotface!
I love the way cos he goes I got something for you and with the ink he goes, oh, alright, and he throws it and and he goes, nice catch!
Yeah.
You know another bit that was really good?
The bit where, where she goes, are you gon na do it like the pigeons?
He goes, no, you're not supposed to do it like that you're supposed to get her on the floor and step on her head! you're not doing it right!
I think he's really gorgeous.
I've fallen in love yeah.
Yeah.
And the bit where she's, the mum's cleaning it up and she's got the gas.
That was wicked.
And when she, when she goes when she goes, is he in that chair?
And he goes she's ke she's beating him up under the chair she goes.
And she goes excuse me and she goes back in.
She was really good in that.
I like the bit when he goes, yeah, when he goes pirates!
And he, and she's going, oh! and she goes, what did you do, Fred?
And he goes, I did n't do anything And he goes, he goes, she goes, right, you be the captain I'll do everything else, do n't touch nothing.
He goes, alright then.
What, not even that?
And he pushes it and runs out.
I think it's so funny.
I've seen it three times now.
I'm sick of it now.
Like it's a difference with with thing like Beetlejuice, every time I watch it I notice a few things that are different.
but, with that.
I love Beetlejuice.
I love the way he says that!
I like Flatliners, that's good.
I ai n't seen that.
Forever Young's good erm.
Oh, leave her.
I've never really been, like, single single cos I'm always sort of like, not actually going out with somebody but I'm always, I've always got someone who sort of fancies me or I'm flirting with.
Do you know what I mean, like?
Someone like James for, how long did that go on for, for about a month, when he could n't he stop talking about me all the time it was sort of like, you know, I like this, you know what I mean, he was talking.
Cos that was what So cruel in front of Nick.
Yeah, just to fl flirt with.
But I mean, I wa I was really pleased when Toya come up to me and she goes, James ca n't stop talking about you in Science.
I was thinking mm.
He goes, he thinks you're, he thinks you're so funny I ca n't I do it in music.
I do n't flirt!
I just, you've seen me flirt!
You've seen me, she's seen me flirt all the time.
he's not bothered.
No, I ca n't do it now not in front of Cathy and that lot, they'll think me a little slag and I do n't particularly want that image.
Where is he then?
Gone.
When he comes I'll call him again.

Do you know what he done?
I cuddled him and he grabbed hold of me bum!
This is me.
This is me, I goes, I goes I'll let it slip this time cos you have n't seen me for a few weeks.
Just before he got a good grip he went, he got a grip and he was just about to squeeze this, I went I sort of went of tiptoes and I goes, I'll let it slide this time.
