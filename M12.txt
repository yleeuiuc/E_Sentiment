
Automatically yes.
So, same as this.
If you press this one, if you press record it wo n't because there's a tape in but if you just press press record automatic and you press record and the play button but you ca n't press just the record button.
They automatically both go down.
Provided there's a tape in the.
in the machine that.
Yeah.
noisy.
You're gon na.
No.
No it does n't.
Yes.
It's going slowly now.
Going much more slowly now as it records more conver conversations.
at all.

We'll just have to put it down there some time and just put it on.
So you would n't know when it's on or when it's off.
Just have to try and, take a little while to get used to it.
Once you're used to it it's probably.
It's all a matter of getting used to being recorded.
Conversation.
I know.
Yeah.
Mm.
Do n't know really.
I've not really heard you much on the phone.
Well yeah but.
Oh yeah I knew it was you so it did n't make a lot of difference.
You sound different.
Vera does.
Mm.
She sounds funny on the phone.
Most odd.
Phone her up and think that's not Vera I'm talking to.
Does n't sound like Vera.
But it is although it does n't sound like her.
Funny innit?
No it just sounds.
No just sounds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Specially if you're phoning a posh restaurant.
Or something like that.
You tend to sort of I'd like to book a table for two.
on Saturday night.
Rather than say look mush I want a.
I want a table, you know.
Not many to do now done them all.
What about.
Yes thank you.
Fine.
I would have done it actually when, when I took the plate out but the water in the bowl was cold.
Thought it was hot but it was cold.
Mm.
Mm.
Washing the walls and What's going on outside?
Car or lorry or something going by by the sound of it.
Yeah.

Yeah.
No.
Not really.
fact it'll be quite handy in a way really, you know it's.
handy to live on the on your right next to work in a way cos you do n't have to worry about.
getting there so much do you?
Handy, really.
And it's not far from town.
It's a little walk but it's not that far is it?
Top Street and you.
cross the main road and you.
and you're like the horse fair.
No.
We're not there yet are we?
It's going well.
Oh yeah.
Sorry?
I wrote it.

You have.
Not really.
Well have n't really got much of an accent at all have I?
Yes.
But not this region.
Ah.
Get.
Yeah, suppose.
Never mind.
Rita?
that sort of.
Romford yeah.
So she's got a bit of an accent in in a way has n't she?
No.
Frank?
Frank and Barbara.
Frank's London is n't he?
Bob?
Bob's Notting.
Not though is he?
Yeah.
No.
Mm.
Sonny is more sort of.
Norfolkish is n't he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Well it's only about as far up there as it is up town.
Do n't think the weather's gon na be too bad.
Mhm.
Not that.
we're going anywhere.
So you could n't get interested in it?
No.
It's a bit I do n't know.
see what it's about.
What about it?
You do n't really know cos you were n't in interested.
Yeah.
again.
No.
I've seen people caned.
Saw one one lad was really really sort of well okay he was n't clever by any stretch of the imagination but he just, was just a you know a sort of no-hoper and he he riled one teacher up very very badly one day cos he did n't do his homework or he was pratting about or he was you know.
And he got this he got a ca no it was n't a cane but it was a quite a big stick.
It was n't a sort of a sort of a thin cane, it was quite a big stick, he whacked him a couple of times across the backside.
And he really, and he really did belt him one.
You know.
Cor but he got him so riled and you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was just a nice teacher.
Got on al we got on ever so well with him.
I did anyway, I got on with most teachers but but he did, really did give him a a really big, say a big couple of swipes on his backside.
Mr Mr had erm a locker.
You know he had about half a dozen in there, you know he.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah which one you know.
Right you're gon na get one of these.
Which one do you want sort of thing, you know?
Yeah that will, no, maybe not.
Maybe this one.
Try that one today.
Aah!
Yeah.
No I do n't think I was ever caned.
Yeah.
Too good.
Yeah.
Goody goody.
I'm a good boy now are n't I?
Oh sometimes.
No.
Oh I do n't know about model, but no, not a model pupil dear.
I tried.
Sometimes it took hours and sometimes it did n't.
Depending how much you got.
Yeah.

Just far enough to get your earhole.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Eat chalk?
What, lumps of chalk?
Real passion killers like then?
Well sorry if she did n't wear any at all eh dear, eh?
They ought to.
Seem to put them away for a long while but.
Mm I do n't think so.
Oh here we go again!
I've abandoned abandoned you all day, most of the day darling and.
I know.
Well there's you're quite welcome to come with me if you want to.
You do n't want to.
Well there you are then.
If you do n't want to you do n't want to.
So a little bit of discipline and a clip round the earhole obviously done them good.
I was gon na say they discipline hard to discipline's much more.
No.
Mm.
Yeah.
Good for some things.
Exuberant.
Yeah but probably now they'd call it hyperactivity.
A lad.
Mm.
Yeah.
Bored yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
No.
When I was at the garage getting the petrol I give them, signed the cheque and they put the cheque through the cheque machine printing it out and that and er they've got a free offer at the moment.
You collect these tokens for collect so many tokens and you get a free Corgi toy.
I mean normally I do n't bother with the tokens, I mean I Anyway I paid the cheque and I said to Peter I said oh by the way what about me tokens for me for me toy I said if I get a free one of them I can give it to give it to the grandchildren.
See, Ricky'd like that I'm sure, little Corgi car I said.
He said oh no you do n't get them with cheques.
Cash sales only.
I thought I just spent twenty seven quid on petrol I said.
free couple of vouchers for a new for a Corgi toy.
There's a woman in there she said oh give it to him.
I said give you a cuddle some time.
I just thought you know I okay it's only a cheque I know but.
No.
That's what I thought.
I think it's I think it's one voucher for fifteen litres.
Now what do I have?
If I had twenty seven quid's worth at fifty P a litre that's fifty two fifty two?
Fifty two litres roughly so if it was one voucher for fifteen that's three innit?
And I think it was six vouchers for for a free.
free Corgi toy.
So all I've got to do is when I run out again fill it up again spending another twenty five quid's worth or so that would have been six and I could have had a free Corgi toy for Ricky for Christmas.
Or whatever.
Little present innit?
Has n't cost me nothing has it?
Or has n't cost you anything.
But next time I shall have to run, take the cash in there.
And see see what they say next time.
pays a cheque it was just easier to pay by cheque.
And they've got a machine to do it anyway to work it all out, print it all out.
Oh no.
Would have thought so.
Yeah.
Bet mum's still got that.
You want to ask her about that.
You could see if anyone's got one at work could n't you?

say there's not that many there is there?
Only a plate and a few fork, fork and a knife and that.
She's done everything else.
Oh yeah.
Yeah of course.
Do n't forget that clock's gone about five minutes slow.
Yes, yes.
Oh there was couple of nice bums there definitely.
And then when we finished er finished the game about, I do n't know must have been about twenty to eleven when we finished the game there was sandwiches and chips coming out.
Well the game had finished you see so they brought supper out.
Mm sometimes yeah.
basket of chips and.
sl sliced sliced sliced boiled potatoes and some er.
sandwiches and french bread and that.
It it was about ten to, five to eleven mm Bob said you know cos we went, me Ron Bob went in in Shirley's car and er cos Dave and Tracy they come in their own car because Sarah was not feeling very well so they had.
So Tracy went back to the Griff and said oh share in with the supper.
The, for the A team yeah.
Erm as I say it was about ten to five to eleven and Bob said what are you you know what's Ron doing?
He.
Yes he was.
Very much so.
Said what you doing and.
and I said I said to Bob I said well, you know said well had n't you better get cos Shirley had had a go at Bob first off, before when, when I went in there first thing.
Shirley said and do n't stay to the end.
He said well you've got to stay to the end I mean, but do n't stay right to the end, you know sort of.
So she'd had a bit of a go at Bob and er.
like I say about ten to eleven, five to eleven said what are you doing then Bob?
He said well I'm.
Shirley's sort of getting on to you a bit I think we'd better make a move.
home and.
Pardon?
Have one more at yours before we you know before you go home sort of thing you know.
He said oh I do n't know, well what's Ron doing?
Ron!
What do you want to do?
I'm stopping for another.
So we stopped for another one.
Du n no.
And I had John Smith bitter.

What the?
It's a goldmine.
Absolute goldmine.
It's years since I've been in there.
Must be about three or four years since I've been in there.
Oh no.
It's a nice pub.
say that but er they've extended it.
down the back and out the back there for darts and that.
Well maybe, maybe they maybe they change it round when there there's something on there and there's no darts on or that.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I say it was say it was about three, four years since I've been in there so.
they'd extended it, they extended it round the back and.
Oh it.
It's probably where they've got the dartboard and that in there.
Probably change it round.
Yeah there is.
Oh did you?
Mm little dance and.
Stewie in The Loco well huh.
Well not everybody but.
Knew the landlord.
Who I had n't seen for goodness knows how long.
Hallo Stewie, how are you mate!
Bloody hell's that?
Knew his face and I ca n't remember his damn name.
Gary.
Yeah, he would.
Because there was n't a tall slim ginger-haired chap in.
I did think it, well I did think it was a possibility but I mean.
there's a little boy there'd be no chance of him going in there anyway.
So.
What's his what's her mum and dad look like?
Maybe they were in the lounge perhaps.
Sort of Tom size?
Well I did n't see anybody.
Mm.
Well then I certainly did n't see anybody in there looking like that.
I must admit.
No I did n't see anybody looking like that so I do n't know.
Thursday night anyway I would n't, does she go to the Empire.
Thursday night do n't they, bingo?
Thursday night not at the Empire.
Wednesday night the Empire, Friday night.
Thursday night.
Yeah.
Sherwood, yeah Sherwood Avenue.
No just a short walk.
well.
I did n't.
Well I tried not to, but.
Bob said do you want a drink and Ron said do you want a drink and I said to Ron do you want a drink Ron and everyone said do you want a drink and.
No, not that many.
But er.
probably erm.
Well I do n't mind.
if it is.
That's what they want.
Natural conversations so.
I'll have a can of beer and then I'll probably go to bed.
They've gone have they?
Oh.
I'd better have a bottle then.
Oh you drunk them as well?
Oh.
ah oh now what am I gon na do?
I'm without.
Crafty devil.
Put them round the corner where where I did n't know where they were.
No I'm not.
Yeah?
They been at it, have they been at it again?
What've they been up to now then?
Gawd.
What time was this?
Well that would n't please them next door would it?
Coo.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yes.
Bad as that?
As you say is the bathroom.
That's his.
Oh lord.
Well I say it's er amazing they've not said, said something.
Who Ann and Rita or?
Sally innit?
It was Sally if it was a blue e, blue cavalier.
T D O something something something.
Ca n't she?
Maybe.
Maybe maybe.
Mm.
Yeah.
You knew what was possibly going on.
Mm.
Unless there's something really.
Mm.
Well there you go I mean.
Mm.
Gon na say you're you're.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard.
Mm maybe.
Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita have n't sort of did n't.
May maybe.
Maybe.
They part of the banging.
Probably part of the banging Ann and Rita.
Very kind of you.
No.
No.
Had me tea last night and the beer and few sandwiches last night.
Up yours mate.
I'm going home.
Ten o'clock and that's it.
Or whatever.
Not often.

P E fourteen seven P G.
Mm.
Seven P G.
I can always remember it.
Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen, half of fourteen is seven and then T.
G.
So that's how I remember it.
Funny innit?
I know yes.
Very strange, yeah, very strange.
Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers.
Because there are s specific set numbers.
Once I see.
associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together.
And then the numbers, the numbers I do n't remember that well.
Some of them I do.
now with them changing the the changeover cos they always used to be the letters followed by the numbers.
Now they've got the initial letter followed by the number then the letters.
Rather than so As I say you associate the car and the number together.
It would probably throw me completely If you.
it would throw me completely if you put, if you changed some of the number plates over.
If you put Tina's number plate on another car and visa versa that would throw, I I'd probably look at it and think you know, oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I would n't think about it.
Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L if it was on a different car I'd probably look at it and think.
it's not right, it's not Tina's.
And so I would n't think that that I probably Just a just a trait of personality.
Do n't really do n't really care to tell you the truth in a way but.
Well no I care I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but I do n't care if.
I do n't care about work and them being in a muddle, no not at all.
Let them get on with it.
It is.
Well it is.
Why is n't it?
Well.
if a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow would n't we?
So there you go.
Just cos we're off.
And possibly Tina and that is off so they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and a lot of others were off.
Do n't you agree?
Right.
So what's on the agenda for today?
Where are we going shopping?
But where are we going shopping?
No but where?
Where would Ann want to go?
Right.
Mm.
Maybe not.
No.
And then we're going into town?
Well we've got to go into town.
Mm.
Yeah there's one down, that one down Elizabeth Terrace.
I was just trying to figure out which one it is.
Hundred and twenty.
Hazel's mother.
What used to go to the Salvation Army?
Just trying to think which one it was anyway.
Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is.
Cos I say I know that I know Elizabeth Terrace well.
Hundred and twenty.
Let's go and have a look.
Oh it's in here somewhere innit?
Oh yeah here we are, hundred and twenty.
Ah the one one in from the end.
Yeah, I know the one now.
One in from the end.
Ca n't think who lived there now.
God, cos I used to call on that one.
perhaps.
The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace parking.
That's the only trouble.
The only consolation if.
if that was a possibility or if that became a possibility mum only live round the corner.
Not that far away is she?
Few hundred yards.
And I could leave the car in her driveway.
So that is a possi I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know some of them are a bit you know.
a bit dodgy.
I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but nearer Helen's end.
There was one there that was empty and for a long long while.
The builders started building, knocking it about.
And then it.
and then, no the ran out of money.
The builder ran out of money and the it was just a shell.
You know, nothing in it.
No windows no doors no nothing er you know, completely gutted it to make it all, to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty.
And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter?
It would n't do it a lot of good, no exactly.
exactly.
No.
Well that's what she's that's what she's she's, she just sort of she did n't mean it but.
it was her thought that we were.
Yeah.
Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light.
Definitely.
That's the way I'm reading it.
I'm.
I'm disappointed that he's not been back.
to discuss it.
And to put the position to him.
Look the market's not very good I know but we're sitting tenants.
We're quite happy to take it on.
We'd like to take it on.
If we leave have you got another tenant to come in?
You're gon na lose two hundred and fifty pound a month.
And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month.
You know, not one that he has any hassle in getting.
No no.
But.
as I say you look at I mean this is two fifty.
You look here in the paper and see how much they are.
You're talking two sixty, two eighty.
To let.
Three seventy.
Detached four bedroomed house admittedly.
Granary.
Two b two two bed.
Two bed second floor self-contained flat.
Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy five unfurnished.
Armada Close two eighty.
Norfolk Street two eighty.
That's furnished.
Six months.
Two eighty.
Norfolk Street self-contained principally first floor flat, two bedrooms furnished two eighty.
No, of course not.
But as I say.
Two sixty two eighty which is the same price as.
No.
Fifty or fifty five were n't it?
Is that the one Ann is in now?
Or in that area.
Yeah.
But I mean you see her up town though.

Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town.
Which has made, which which just makes me think.
And she walks to work.
No no.
But that just makes me think why, that's what makes me think she's living.
No but yeah.
Oh yeah I've been in one of them.
You know I've seen them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Mm.
But that's what they're going for though is n't it?
If they can get them for that.
Yeah.
Oh the mortgage you mean?
Oh yeah.
Well that's if you're prepared to buy a flat.
That's the only thing is n't it?
If you're prepared to buy a flat.
You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though.
Tenants.
Yeah but not only that but I mean if you.
Yeah.
well I mean all, all well it counts towards your income as well.
Counts counts towards your income.
Mm.
Oh I know.
Well there's for one.
sell.
Think.
I think you'll find it counts towards your income.
So I mean if you had a job.
You, you got a job say you're earning.
earning ten thousand a year.
And you're going, you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month as well in rent.
I think so, yeah.
Oh I do n't know but I mean I would n't have thought so.
Yeah.
That's probably why they're the price they are, two eighty.
Because people take.
and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina.
And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah we could is n't it?
I do n't like the, I do n't like the bedroom.
situation for one.
You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed.
Handy I suppose but.
In some respects but I mean it just does n't I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non smoker and Wiggie being a non smoker.
is n't so bad but, I mean if you're like us and I mean the smoke's just.
Yes.
Exactly.
The smoke would just rise straight up and.
straight up into the bedroom.
I mean she does n't smoke anyway so I mean you know.
She would do.
Oh yeah.
Across the top of the stairs like or.
Because of the light in that little.
Straight upstairs.
And that.
skylight.
Mm yeah.
She can shut it off.
Mhm.
With the light.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
Side yeah so it fall.
Mm.
Like a venetian blind in a way.
Or a straight down blind but at an angle but er but on runners to hold, yeah.
Yeah.
Do they owe.
the building society.
Yeah.
Yeah but on the yeah but I mean if she sold it for thirty two she'd still owe them nine thousand would n't she?
Yeah.
Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway.
But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be.
They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to pay off the the existing mortgage on that one and the balance.
I mean they can afford it between them.
Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance.
Maintenance.
Yeah.
Yeah that would cut it down would n't it? on their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you consider the outgoings as well eighty pound a.
For the interest rate yeah, but it would only buy the same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already.
Yeah.
No cos she still owes, if she sold it she'd still owe the balance between the selling price and.
That would be added to it you see.
That's it.
Mm.
Mm.
But that's about fifty is n't it?
As I say you're looking at a.
Expenses.
And then out of Wiggie's he's got.
Mhm before you even start.
Mm.
Mm mm.
That's true.
It's not it's not a bad car is it?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah if that one, that Elizabeth Terrace one is, is the one I think it is which is the one fairly near the end in that in that bottom, bottom row I think the live in the first one, they still live in the first one on the corner.
I'm not sure if they've moved actually now.
They may have done.
Got a funny feeling they have now.
But Who's that?
Bloody hell.
Did somebody kick you out of bed this morning Brian?
Thought somebody must have kicked him out of bed this morning.
Only half half past ten.
That ai n't bad.
Got the time to have a quick look at the paper now have n't we?
The Standard?
Oh mind at all.
something erm next week.
In the morning.
Oh yeah well yeah I mean if if they if.
If there's nothing available.
That's what I meant.
Saturday afternoons with Helen.
I do n't know whether they work.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No problem.
Yes.
The upstairs one's larger?
Who's selling that one?
So one's Cornerstone and two are the other.
Yeah.
Hansard.
So they've got one one's doing two and one's doing one.
Yeah.
Neither here nor there is it?
Yes.
Yeah.
That's Cornerstone?
Do n't know whether the same applies to the other two.
With Cornerstone?
Does n't actually say that in Pantiles.
Oh.
Just have to ask.
Fifty pound.
five, yeah.
Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got, he's got four flats there has n't he?
Four flats at thirty thousand.
That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses.
They could be sixty thousand apiece.
Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece.
Forty five thousand even apiece.
But he's making the money by selling them as flats.
Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Only assume there's you've got that one block.
No I do n't think so.
Not enough space for them.
Unless they've knocked them garages down or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
that.
Neither here nor there.
If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like.
Whether you wan na go and see them or not.
Whether you like the positions.
Well we know where it is.
Well we do n't know really.
We have n't seen it have we?
Yeah but we have n't actually looked ins.
I think so yes.
But it would be nice just to go and have a quick check.
Just to make sure I like it.
Or.
You may not like it.
is it?
Or is this the one round the other end?
It's up here.
That one there right on the corner yeah?
I thought there was a separate but it's not, no it's not is it?
It's an older property.
Got the double glazing.
Alright.
Yeah it's an older, more solid house.
Yeah.
Yeah Yeah true.
Very true.
Very true.
Oh I see.
Yeah.
There's a parking space as well.
I do n't think, I do n't think he will.
He's not like that.
If it's on, if it's on the market for a long while.
He can have it on the market for a year or so.
And he's and he's.
Well at the moment he's got us.
Thereabouts anyway.
Yeah.
I mean it's quite a good.
Security locks like like we've like we've got at home.
Yes.
Do n't think.
Yeah.
This is a bit silly is n't it?
Not having any room for a fridge anywhere.
Washing machine in there.
There is n't a fridge.
Unless you, unless you get the fridge in the cupboard.
Same, the same but opposite.
Oh yeah.
It has n't got a toilet either.
It looks like it yeah.
Oh I see.
This is different is n't it?
Yes.
You said it was bigger did n't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.

Oh there is a difference.
No this is the living room.
This is the living room here.
Oh crikey that's a big bedroom too is n't it?
Yeah I said.
Financial.
Yeah.
Underneath us yeah.
No I like this much more.
the bathroom's even nice.
I do n't know why but it just is.
I do.
Yeah I do.
I do.
I do.
Yeah.
Numbers five six and seven is n't it?
Yeah.
I like the look well I like this one if out out out of all of them.
this is much more much the nicer.
Much the nicer.
there's room.

Never mind we'll just have to stay here the night.
I think it just needs a bit of.
a bit of something on it just to.
key.
WD forty.
Yeah.
Mm.
turn it right round the key it should.
Yeah it's not.
It needs, just needs a little bit of attention.
That's to open it and that's to lock it.
Take the key out and that should lock it now.
But now it should yeah it does.
That's now locked.
You wo n't be able to shut it now because of that.
You could leave it open that way.
If you leave it to there then that will click then then you'll be alright.
Not if you've turned it that way cos then you wo n't be able to.
Does n't matter.
If you'd have let me in I could have washed your back for you.

Do you have any problem with the heating?
Or.

Mm.
Cos.
It was slippy though I mean I noticed that even, you know just pulling away from or something like that okay I mean it's a reasonably car but I mean, you know just a little bit too heavy on the accelerator.
it's very easy you can feel it slipping.
quite easily.
Lovely.
Yeah thank you.

We came round to give you a lift.
Well we did n't know, we were n't sure but.
Well we did n't know what time when we.
They're both flats.

There's no room for any.
well there's room for a cooker and a washing machine.
Yeah brand new empty.
Well the upstairs half.
There's four flats altogether in that block.
Well the upstairs one's certainly much much better than the downstairs one.
Yeah.
The upstairs one.
Yeah well fifteen hundred.
Five percent is.
they're both flats.
A downstairs flat.
Older, yeah it's an older house but it's been completely.
The bath the kitchen's nice in that one though is n't it?
Yeah.

Rabbitting?
No.
Yeah.
Oh.
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I could n't see her cos I had my back turned.
Yeah.
Well there you are.
When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know.
I did n't know what on about there.
I I think he got his.
Oh he knew what he was talking about but.
Well you see the thing is they they they.
they quote this unit linked business.
Now it's all.
well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that if they, if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you.
you could, you can lose a th I do n't want one.
If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature wallop.
You can lose a lot of money in a you know, just like that.
No.
PEP's different.
PEP's a personal equity plan.
Which is different.
To be perfectly honest in my current situation.
a pension mortgage would be more advantageous.
At the moment.
Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work.
But I have got an option to go in it.
if I want to.
Erm the only problem is well, even s even, not so much now because because the er a bit better.
Because of the m because of the way pensions and that are are organized now, they're more flexible now I mean, you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme, you were obliged to go in it that was it.
All your other arrangements went up, went through the window.
Erm so it it it it's difficult.
You can now take, now now now you can take them with you.
That's right.
That's right.
Whereas now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into one.
Mm.
So in a way I think.
I mm yeah but that w do n't forget.
that was sixty five.
The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years.
Particularly in the later years there's you know.
more And that's why I said, when it sounded so low that's why I I still doubt his figures.
I still think two hundred pound a month a thirty thousand pound mortgage it's too low.
Still think it's low.
No.
I'm pretty certain.
You have to have term assurance.
You'd have.
No no no.
No.
That was it, two hundred and twelve pound.
The whole lot.
Because not everybody's eligible for them.
Did n't ask.
Did n't ask the questions.
He did n't he.
He's not doing his job.
Basically.
he's not doing his job.
He did n't, he he did n't ask the question.
Which he should have asked.
You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out, LAUTRO and all that business came out that, and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing.
What they've got insurance already erm so on and so forth.
And arrange around those circumstances the best advice package.
But he did n't ask me the questions.
He just he just he just.
he just assumed it was gon na be.
No.
Well you see when he said your base is gon na be.
a hundred and two hundred.
and fifteen pounds or whatever.
And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer.
That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year.
Then it goes back up to the base rate.
Not, I know all that's that's obvious.
But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension mortgage I thought well if a hundred and ninety.
if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you do n't.
how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with, because of the term assurance on top.
That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance.
Quite high I think.
Term assurance is life insurance just on life only.
With no cash sum at the end.
But er throughout throughout the term of my life.
If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable.
But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high.
Term assurance.
I'm tempted, I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick.
Well.
well I, whether I, I do n't know whether he would or whether he would n't.
I mean he might he might not but then again he might.
He might if I, if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of I do n't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled.
him before.
Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I do n't wan na I'd like to know.
I'd like to know before you know.
Yeah.
I, I did two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and fift okay it sounds cheap but I do n't know fourteen pound a month just for li thirty thousand pound life cover over suppose it's the.
I suppose it's the term of years.
Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well.
You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty.
So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book to check it I ca n't.
I ca n't tell you.
You see you can, you get a lot, you can get tax relief off that or you used to be able to get tax relief.
On the whole lot, yeah.
At twenty five percent.
I think you still, I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos that you see if you, if you, if you could link up life assurance to your pension you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see?
Which makes it advantageous because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was.
There used to be, yeah.
there is, they stopped it.
There is n't any more.
No, I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Are interested in.
Mm.
No.
No.
Yeah.
See the other thing, I do n't know well no I'm not sure you can now.
See if I took a pension mortgage out it would be linked to me lumped into me current pension contract.
Cos I've already got a pension scheme running.
Cos I've contracted out of SERPS.
And also got erm erm what used to be called seventy seven.
Erm a frozen pension with the Pru.
linked in with it at the moment.
That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the moment.
Mm so I'm tempted er if I'm gon na do a pension.
Well that's what he's done.
You see that's what he's done.
Mm.
Oh the erm the Scots chap?
Er what's his name?
Oh I ca n't think of his name now.
I I I have had dealings with him.
Yeah.
No.
But nor's he.
That's it.
Independent financial advice.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah well they're agents for Bradley, Bradford and Bingley.
Yeah.
It does n't matter what building society you go to.
Yeah.
Medical condition.
Yeah.
See the thing yeah.
As I say the thing, the thing is as I say it's you you your mor.
Yeah.
Your mortgage, it does n't matter who your mortgage is with, basically.
I mean you can go to most places and.
you're gon na be paying.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Discount.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To cover your costs.
Mm.
As I say it does n't matter what building.
it does n't matter what building society you go to, you're gon na be paying basically the same rate.
Because they're all the same rate.
The base rate's the same.
You, okay one place you can get a percent discount you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your.
depending on the building society at the time.
It's the life policy.
that makes the difference.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Ca n't think of his name now but I know the chap.
He was a tall chap with glasses.
Yeah.
No no.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Was yours an endowment?
Or just.
Mm.
When does your mortgage finish then?
So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to cover that mortgage?
I dunno.
So your endowment policy.
Ended.
Cancelled.
Well what about the money?
Yeah but what about the The life policy was in your name.
Oh just a straight term p policy like I was.
Yeah.
It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment insurance.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
You see.
Yeah.
Well you would do.
It was worth it.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Mm.
So it did n't make any difference.
Mm.
Mm.
So how about you?
You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just pay you weekly I cou might as well rather than monthly.
Mm.
We'll see when we come, when it comes down to it wo n't we?
What we could do financially.
And sort something out then.
But I cert I I I I I ju I it it just sounds you know two hundred pounds a month, just over two hundred pound a month.
Sounds wonderful.
Well that's why I ca n't believe it.
And check his figures.
Well I I I yeah.
I mean obviously I'd have to pay more er for if I want it to end at sixty.
To get to get a higher lump sum.
To get a higher lump sum.
But then you see.
Should n't think so.
You see it's.
Oh yeah.
And a pension.
Mm.
Say it's only twenty six years and course with a pension see you can increase your contributions.
Better job or whatever or pay rise or whatever you can increase.
your contributions into your pension plan.
and still, and finish your mortgage earlier.
Fifty five.
Or fifty.
Depending on how much you wan na pay.
If you wan na pay more into it.
But I still think.
See what he comes up with, yeah.
See what he comes up with.
It's cheaper than we're paying now is n't it?
Well you'd still.
In a way I'd rather pay the same and finish the mortgage earlier.
And pay a higher pension policy.
And then and then you've got the option then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums on your pension you can do.
If anything if if it does You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy.
Well.
Well, then you have to freeze it.
See that's that's the oth that's another drawback with the pension.
Whereas an endowment policy it does n't matter.
You you can carry on paying an endowment policy.
So it, you know there's pros and cons either way.
There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of tho either of the flats.
You see er that's the thing is n't it?
I do.
Call it, it's thirty thousand is n't it?
What is it, twenty nine nine nine five.
You might as well call it thirty thousand.
But you would n't have to buy any carpets.
And you say we'd gon na have to have a cooker and a fridge and that are n't you?
Unless I say if you knocked him down.
Oh buying it on some sort of.
Or look around and see what there is going in the, in the market.
And get a sort of.
no percent free credit.
Say if we I mean if, if we're paying say two hundred pound a month on a mortgage.
for twenty eight thousand.
We've got fifty pound a month we can play with and we, to buy.
to buy a cooker over the ne.
Oh.
Cup of tea?
There you are darling.

Say, yeah fifty four, right, fair enough.
You had a choice of an eight or a three I had two jacks and a king you chose the three, the two turned up that would've given you eight and a but you picked the three so that'll give you more in the box as well an three hit your three hit your hand as well so.
The only reason I've beaten you this time is look at that sixteen Do n't even know four one for are you?

You'll start getting back now, now you're back to your last four pence when it comes down you start getting back do n't you?
Oh, what do I want here?
Oh I do n't know whether I wanted that Bloody hell!
One, two, three on the bounce three, six, eight, jack what's that supposed to be?
And a pair of tens jack, queen, king Feel alright?
Bloody man, I do n't want to see that it's got three on it.
Well here are, one, two, three on the bounce and I thought well you know that's a fairly good start, jack, queen, king king high was a bit dodgy you never know do you?
Is that what you're playing?
Three fours eight, nine, ten queen high the pairs stuck at the end though dear.
Must of been.
Yeah, I know, I know yes.
Not really no.
Ooh!
Ooh!
You bugger!
No neither can I.
Nope No how's it going?
Wan na play one, two, three, four, five, six and have n't you?
Or five six seven and that's what you wan na do innit?
No no I would n't do that I always do it like this if I was playing that hand three flu well you could go well you got a choice you can go take a chance on your last hand, not getting through or you can go two, three, five, six, seven two three four, ace finish them which is what I'd probably do.
One more try.
three queens jack flush ace high, so I mean you would n't get any it anyway.
Yeah but I mean it's it makes you one, two, three, you would n't of had a one two three to start with.
but you had a eight to finish with which is finishing and a one, two, three might not be and a better run so I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there try and stop me rather than trying to win it cos you had nothing else did you?
No you did n't have you did n't have a finishing hand, you did n't really have a brilliant first two hands and then the pick of the one, two, three bouncer I might I might have been persuaded to play the one, two, three bouncer and hope that that got through but to finish with an ace flush but good.
Neither have I.
There a nice pair of fours ace high there er seven, pair of nines, ace high about all you got really that's all of it whatever you got.
Eight, ten, pairs.
pair of nines, pair of fours ace.
high I'm only coming out with a ten flush, pair of aces, and a pair of eights would have been mine whichever way you played it.
about or either of them want all your pennies my dear.
However or is that a damn crying shame however or is that a damn crying shame terrible you know what you need to do for now then, now I've won all.

That's the first job first one in then you get the carpet sorted out.
At least at least you know how you know if he says you can have this one or this one yeah cos the choice between one or the other and he says well I can fit this one immediately, but, this one I've got ta order.

two main bit.
Yeah but then again yeah but as I say i i if you if you want the same in the bathroom and the bedroom.
and the same in the hall in the living room.
you only got two carpets to sort out and a bit of lino rather than having a different one with this one and a different one for that one and then a different one for.
Alright.
Alright dear.
Hey Ann!
Did you read your stars today?
You did n't?
Saturn your ruler is in exceptionally mood now so it is likely that you will have to put up with rather spartan conditions but you know how much is at stake for the future so you are happy to do without.
How about that darling?
Okay.

It's the only thing you wanted really.
Mm.
No I'm sure we are Yes we certainly are dear.
Well yeah but.
I know.
But we had to really because.
No.
Well they said they'd wait, I mean fifteen hundred pound ai n't he would pa put a deposit down, it's only five percent innit?
Fifteen hundred pound if he was prepared to put a deposit down or something that would have been fifteen hundred quid.
So we got it.
Yeah.
Without any quibble.
I thought it was worth pushing for the extra I mean when he said a thousand, I thought it would be.
worth pushing for an extra five hundred, and did get it.
Yeah.
Yeah but now we got the extra five hundred and which I say is th is, makes up for the which is five percent of the purchase price we've got an extra to play with and get a bit more.
Not too bad.
True, true.
Yeah.
Right yeah.
In the hall?
I've only seen one, I have n't seen any more than one at.
Seen that one.
Oh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Mhm It says it does n't, but like I say, i in a way it usually starts.

Mm.
Mm mm.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Set them off.
Ha ha Yeah it is.
It is a little bit er.
Oh yeah ca n't jump on the window to get in or anything.
Well it's certainly gon na be certainly wo n't let it.
It's gon na be a little bit tricky is n't it really, having a.
It's a shame.
Yeah.
Not really.
It's not natural no.
Not really is it?
We might do one day or see.
Yeah a cat's a little bit out on dashing upstairs now innit really?
It's a shame, but, there you go.
Yeah.
It ai n't fair.
Actually that's something we'll have to negotiate with our er opposite neighbour.
stair carpet.
Do n't know who you got we'll have to wait and see who we get.
Yeah yeah.
Oh no.
Yeah.

I say a negotiation with next door neighbour or something like that.
Start banging up the stairs and.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There is a light out there is n't there?
I noticed that.
Mm that is something we will have to investigate.
di discuss with our.

No, no that's right.
Yeah.
You.
Yeah.
I've got ta nip upstairs.
Cos I would n't know I've done enough okay?
Yeah.
I think so I said said to the bloke before.
!
Oh!
On traffic lights?
Well off we go, back to work.
Would n't be a lot of difference actually.
No By time you I mean it's not that far but by the time you get there the car wo n't have a chance to warm up thoroughly.
So you'd be on automatic choke for a bit of the way, most of the way anyway so.
a little bit, but not a great deal those gears most of the time as well the ones that we cruise in top gear I do n't think that's really for me.
Not appreciably amateur.
A little bit perhaps I would n't of said it would have been.
I hope so.
That would be stroll up to the Royal Standard.
About that again, it's a similar distance I would say.
It's as near to the as it would have been from there.
It's we can always walk up the.
Walk in the town.
No, it's a longer way.
Yeah.
No erm might as well continue now half way round do a u-turn.
Yeah looks like it dunnit?
No the only w.
The only way to town is come up to way.
towards Boy's School then Corporation Road and then in town.
No no there's not.
You go down to the bottom of these roads there and.
No, there's metal boxes at each.
end.
If you come up er when you're at the Weasel Lane.
instead of turning up towards the Royal Standard you turn the other way, that comes down past.
Then you go right down to the bottom of Road you cos that's a dead end anyway,.
Mhm.
It is n't a great problem not really.
You got a shop at the top of the road ai n't you?
Shops at the top there.
No that's up that's just up the.
The new Tescos wo n't be the other way will it?
Mm a bit odd.
Hello er I need a solicitor, to act for me er if that's possible please.

Go for a walk.

You know what it is.
Yes.
I know your type!
That's quite often why I like, when I go down Norbet Street I do n't like parking in Norbet Street itself cos it's only half an hour if you park down Royal Place it's.
an hour.
Then I could have an hour, you see so it just gives you that extra breathing space if you.

That's it you go to.
the butchers or the bakers or.
you have a couple of bets in the bookies that sort of thing.
Quite normal to be a little bit more than half an hour but el traffico wardens about an whoever takes your number sort of jus just after you parked then it is half an hour but sometimes it's not for.
yeah but you do n't know that do you?
If you're in the bookies and you do n't happen to see them.
I'd love to.
Morbidity.
How's that sound?
Morbidity.
Well not feeling very happy morbid.

going up.

Mm, mm.
Not really, was, though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration.
price market.
erm, how long we've been here sitting tenants er.
the, I thought that was fair.
fairly good deal.
Might do, yeah.
When you look at, look at the old houses on the market, erm, yeah, I think he might just, he might wait a while, there are n't that many buyers,.
I think looking at the market you can, you can get a, erm detached, semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose,.
two bedroom at a push for about thirty four, thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven,.
oh I do n't know, I do n't know, I think it will be a while getting rid of it yes, but I think he might get his price eventually, but it will take a long while to get it, it's up to him if he wants a quick sale, you know, thirty five yeah I, thirty five thousand I think, as I say taking everything into consideration, I mean, failing three okay I know I did the thirty three so take thirty five, thirty three and a half, oh he ai n't got much to worry about.


I know.
Why, what's been.
Go on.
, its not er.
Cos a conversation like that very well be a private person will not be a.

Wo n't be long.
Yeah, alright.
What I've, what I've brought, and I've brought three.
one I've brought that basically.

so it throughout the year.
that's sort of a rough average, but that's er a better, you know a more, that's.
that's when the season's in.
see, obviously we, we do more overtime.
I've brought everything that you've told me to.

It's just bumph basically.
Just saying you have put.
You've agreed to buy this place.
Your this is something something something.
We hope.
We hope it goes satisfactorily.
Ca n't they?
I thought there was still time to have a look at it just in case it falls through.
Well I dunno, but I mean.
But I mean if that goes if that goes through if that falls through somebody might be interested and and somebody might erm I dunno.
Like you say, probably they put subject to contract on and.
Yeah.
No.
As far as I know.
Doubt it.
Doubt it.
Do n't see any reason why I should not that they've had nothing wrong.
I've had nothing wrong with me.
I do n't suffer from anything.
For the pension purpose, for the pension plan a medical is not needed.
That is, does n't matter.
The only thing that I might need a medical for is my thirty thousand pound life insurance.
That's the, I wo n't need, if if I just did the pension.
You you would n't mother!
No mother!
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
Can I just.
can I just intervene here and.
Can I just.
can I just intervene here just a little bit because.
if.
if if I'm bumped off that thirty thousand pounds go off to, goes to pay the mortgage.
Well you'd have to sell the flat then.
I think I mean, it's something, a pension mortgage is something that does n't crop up every day.
It can it can be yeah.
It can.

better put her seat-y belt on then had n't she?
In case mister police-y man decides to stop us and say why have n't you put your seat-y belt on Mrs M Mrs woman?
Sorry, sir.
It's your responsibility to ensure that your passengers have got their safety belt on.
Cos that would be nice would n't it?
To be fined twelve quid for not having a safety belt on and on top of the ninety quid and the forty quid and one thing and another.
but show you Pat's house if you like.
Would you like to see Pat's house?
Show you Pat's house.
If you look to your left coming into the the junction say I presume, I do n't know whether, they may even have moved now.
See that one, oh you see the one where the trees are?
And the front wall that sort of set back one?
That's Pat you can see it just there, look.
oh the one with the that's Pat's house.
That's if he still live there as I say.
Should think they've moved by now.
That's where he used to live anyway.
Pat's wife and daughter are erm they call Mrs and Mrs.
WI or.
something like that.
Women it may have been Women's Institute Guild or something or I dunno.
Townswomen's Guild, yeah.
Something like that anyway.
It may, she may have been associated with WI, I dunno.
Used to.
Pat?
Yeah.
In a w I kn I do know of him I do n't know him to.
Yes.
Oh yeah, I think so.
But when I walked in.
when I walked in I, I said you know I said Mr we meet, we meet again I said.
He said ah, Stuart is n't it?
I said yes.
Thought oh that that's fair enough is n't it?
Where shall we park today?
We'll back up to the fence today shall we?

How's that?
Is that near enough?
Yep?
Yep that's.
There is, yes.
blooming cold.
Aha,.
Was it?
Yes yeah.
Cause a stir!
Alright dear?
I've now got there's now in the bank, after I've paid me poll tax and paid me.
paid me poll tax, paid me s search fee and got a little bit of cash out for readies and s, there's now at this moment in time, there's four hundred and fifty pound in there.
And there will be another hundred and twenty go in today so that's six hundred and six hundred and seventy in there at the moment.
So there's a few hundred in the building society.
What do you mean, crossed fingers?
That's what there is and.
That's what I was sa, that's what's in there at the moment.
I thought.
I've got three hundred and.
And a few hundred in the building society.
And I've still got my unit trust thing but I know it's gone down.
I do n't want to touch it if I'll leave and leave it if I can.
It, no, I mean that was always my plan if ever you need the money.
Okay alright.
Hallo Mr.
How are you?
Cheeky bugger.
I was gon na be nice to you today and all.
Yeah as I say, that unit trust thing I was I know it's not the safest investment but it never was the safest investment.
It was a at the time it was a I'd got the money and it was a bit of a speculation.
But unfortunately it's not quite worked out to plan.
But I mean if.
I mean even with the market being depressed there's still gon na be eight hundred pounds in there.
that's mak but that's mak making a loss.
I mean I'd rather leave it if I can until it does.
If we're absolutely desperate then.
Few few days.
Phone them up phone them up.
Find out what.
find out what the price is and if the price is you know whatever then you take them out.
Just say right I'll cash, take cash and you and they will send you a cheque in the post more or less.
But as I say, yeah.
unfortun unfortunately I mean if I'd left it where it was erm would have, it would have been better.
So say if we have to we have to.
You know, I'd rather wait until you know till.
till then.
That's right.
Until the market picks up again and.
yeah yeah but the when I was.
when I was advising.
when I was advising people on unit trust things it was always the price of your units may rise and, as well as fall.
Er.
Oh yeah I mean it was.
at the time, I mean it it was.
Did n't matter so much at that particular time.
And the market looked as though it was gon na be quite buoyant.
I wish I'd have took them out a long while ago when they were higher.
Well yeah, but like you say you do n't know do you?
Say I do n't know what the latest price is on them, but.
No!
Hallo Freda.
Well.
she's, she might be small but her bum's big.
Yeah.
Mm.
Some people you do hate yeah.
Yeah.
Gravel and, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.

Apart from the drums and thighs.
