Not much of a job when it came to put them on like the erm you know the pipe that pushes them out?
You've got ta push them back have n't you?
And you've usually got.
too much fluid in.
Well it says in the book, push them back with a stick.
With a stick and a piece of.
Well if it's frozen there's no way so er I rang up Mobil you see in and the fellow said oh if it's been on for s you know few years he said, take your calliper off, put it in the vice and just lever it back that's what we do.
Goes to get the flexible hose off that was ruddy frozen, you the, the union?
Rang him up again he said oh aye well we usually change those he said, the weather gets on them.
Said they're not like the old ones that go like as though they're welded.
and you're turning the whole pipe.
He said the only, the other thing you can do is loosen it off take the calliper b and turn the calliper round.
It's like turning the car round to take off a bloody bolt, you know?
Oh I thought I'll do that to save another hose.
Anyway did that course he said you'll have to bleed it out.
Did the first one right this was on er Wednesday afternoon you see?
So came to do the other side, went to the same routine the nipple snapped off.
So any rate I rang this fellow I said eh he said oh he said you've got no chance mate, he said.
He said you can drill it out but he said you oh aye your the thread gets damaged and the seating.
and he said if you get one leak on that your brakes.
you're shot.
So a new calliper how much do you think for a new calliper?
Seventy pound plus VAT from Volvo's.
So I thought there's no way, so I rang round the scrapyards.
There's one at Greenville he said oh twenty five pound plus VAT.
That's what I did, yesterday morning went with my mate came back, stuck it on so it's cost me the, the pads were seventeen twenty, thirty pound for the what's a name and fifty quid near enough just to do the front brakes.
And that's before the M O T.
The other week it cost me fifty quid to go to the, to get it tuned you know?
Cars, honest to god.
You want some money today do n't you, just to ruddy eh?
Oh, oh well well you do n't go there do you, unless you've got bloody hell.
Well our M O T guy, fair do you know and he'll say so and so wants doing, can you take it away and do it?
And he does n't charge.
These other ones, as soon as you leave do it yourself that's another twenty quid for a re-test.
Oh aye.
You do it there they only charge fifteen is it or something if they do it.
But I mean you know as you just said then they'd wan na charge you per hour it's.
beyond the working man.

Chairs we're doing today.
There's six of those to do, now then.
Yeah put them in the sale, you know I'm gon na put them in the sale see if we can get a few bob right, pattern first I should imagine.
many people coming to the sales.
I've only put, I've put stuff in.
I er never actually.
Oh yes I believe it gets er quite a lot, it's er well yesterday there were n't many for that open day.
But for the sale er it's well advertised you know and er there's a lot of people seem to know about it, you know connected with the college mainly I suppose, they get their mates to come ooh there's good stuff and there is some good stuff, you know?
So it's er it seems to do pretty well.
I'll er I'll try to get a few things, make a few bob you know, to.
Do n't know yet.
Well I'm hoping a hundred plus.
you know?
Well christ you've got ta be, I've paid that to be honest.
I've paid seventy for the bloody things.
Erm I dunno.
hundred and thirty maybe I'm not, I'm not quite sure to be honest er not quite sure old mate.
Yeah I'll see what they say, you know, erm I'll John, he had a set of erm high backed reproduction erm what do they call them now?
Regency nineteen twenties, in the twenties.
out of mahogany.
They are nice though, they've got the Queen Anne legs and the high back you know?
He got about er two hundred for those last year, set of six.
You know he just bought them from sale or whatever it was, sixty, seventy quid bit of polish.
They were not mistaken.
Did, he did well.
Some of them have a lot of stuff, you know I do n't seem to ever get hold of the stuff me, to tables and that little Eric in there he seems to get loads of stuff.
he's got a lovely table there has n't he? it's a nice one.
I have very few I'm afraid.
Thank you.
Mm.
You're still paying out that's the trouble, all the time.
No, no it's oh no you ca n't go round gummy.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
I mean.
friend of ours, he, he hit his tooth, got a lovely tooth Ken he's sixty one now, never had much trouble you know.
Snapped this one off er you know in an ac he fell over or whatever, on his.
said oh god he did n't know whether to pull it out there and then.
But went to the dentist and he said leave it pushed it right back and he said it will grow back.
Oh yes.
Long as the roots are.
Oh well yes, oh well yeah, oh well now obviously.
I mean my boy had a er a terrible accident ten years ago and smashed all his face all his teeth were when we first saw his face he'd got no teeth left but it's got them all back.
And they're all back and yeah even though they were all, they were all loose I mean still fresh you see the, the break.
And it's, the life is in the, still in the tooth if you can find it, but of course sometimes they've gone have n't they?
Put up with what we've got eh?
Put up with what we've got.
Well as I say I look after mine but I've only got the one missing.
Mm I'd hate to have a load of chop ooh.
Oh yes that's stupid that, he he'll end up if he does n't go, with a mou a mouth of sort of black.
Yes.
I think that's awful if young people.
Yeah that's, that's what they do now yeah.
Yes, yeah so they're not terrified.
I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places.
No.
That's right.
I know, it's a lot of money.
Yeah, week's wages yeah.
That's right, yeah yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the.
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous.
He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it would n't be would it?
No.
Twenty years ago they were, they were alright were n't they?
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about.
Well you know the first time I went was oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out I mean my parents.
but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a.

And they would n't mess about if you, you they slapped you if you did n't do as you were told.
So that put me right off for a start.
But erm you only get one good set do n't you?
I.
Well they get it free do n't they?
At the moment.
Oh yes, yes.
That's right.
No no.
Well that makes me ill now.
It did n't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.
But you know you ca n't tell people.
This friend of ours who lost his wife last year, well we've got another friend who was very fond of her she also smokes we just happened to me we did n't say.
I mean it's happened now so we never.

But.
we know via my daughter she's a nurse and she said no cancer get a lot of uterine cancer and all this it's not, not in the lungs now.
Forget that.
That's obvious.
But all the other things.

But you ca n't tell these people.
This lady we're on about now she's she must be on forty, fifty a day.
A nervous smoker.

So really I'm stymied on that are n't I?
What I'll do today.
Yeah well that's no problem.
What I'll do, I'll measure up today for er.
the top material work out a plan for how much I'll want.
I'll try and get through the neutrally.
I dunno.
Six.
Oh.
oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
That's no good.
Yeah, yeah that's what it wants, someone with big turned legs.
on the table.
You see them do n't you?
Oh well.
Oh you're doing a good job there John.
How many did you say.

Two?
Oh four, oh it's a set is it?

Yeah.
Ah, oh well yeah er.
Ah you see them yeah, yeah table and you want them to match in.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, nice.
I mean how often do you use six?
Oh I see.
we had four kids I mean now it's only when we get visitors you know when.
there's only two of us, you get two visitors we're alright as a four.
We keep ours in the garage, the extra two carvers.
and they come down when you know, if we've got any.
Mm.
Otherwise it's just a waste really.
Oh yes.
Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers ca n't you?
But er oh well Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I did n't like at all because you've got this blue.
You've got no no m no wood that's showing you see, that's the trouble.
Erm but I'm hoping they'll put them on a, on the table when we sell them in here and there's that's the first thing that'll hit them is the turned legs you see?
This is a su survey.
Mm.
this, but this was exposed then?
The material.
Oh that's a shame.
Oh I see.
Yeah, yes so.
The pine and that, yes.
Ruined it, yeah.
Felt like a bit of challenge there.

Is this today is it?
Too late now.

My fault.
No, no.
Actually er.
This erm.
Yeah, he got me some springs.

What about.
full life?
I did your dad's figures as well.

We had some homework to do.
So is there a, a bar there and all this caper?
Subsidised?

I thought it might be like one of these clubs, you know.
I'm getting bloody paranoid about that!
But.
But seriously they want ten times whatever!
And the bricks!
So er got the pads seventeen quid were n't they?
No, seventeen pence you could do it yourself!
Yes, well when I hear do the job could n't you.
Seventeen yeah.

And the.
tried to give.
which you've got ta do the cos they.
so much fluid in the grill.
And all the rest!
They tied the car so they could get in the vice.
The Volvo.
It's alright to use.
Sally said we had to anyway, I did one side did n't I?
Open the Ahhh!
Then go do the other side.
And the er.
Honest, and stuff like that.
That is n't due for an hour there So January.

So what do you do?
There's the calibre with the, with the gone!
So I.
I end up going to Greenfield.
Twenty five pound for a second hand one plus.
Seventy pound in the Volvo.
This is bad enough!
But you know he'd got a huge parlour there was nothing wrong within this one thing and you know, we tried to drill it out you know.
the seating.
We went down to the.
buy a bowl of stuff.
He said here are and tapping him over the nose.
So, but when I tried it it.
Just all the luck of draw is n't it with things like that?
You've just got ta be.
If it's if it seems solid.
then you you got no.
pipes.
The actual hose is about that long.
It looked as though he it was all in one.
and then I spoke to the feller, said aye!
It's supposed.
Found something wrong with his.
he said they just do.


But they tell you.
whatever they do.
is the turn.
So I did that both sides so that.
Well I'll tell you what ah, you'll never be er.
Oh yes, you've got ta replace them.
No I did that before.
to do it's not very dangerous.
That I think will be.

I can sort of get through it and erm understanding it's.

If there's only you.
Not all of them they're not!
Some.

Come up again, look at that!
Good grief!
I know when Carl was, was doing it in a modest way and he, he'd seen this on, and he said it's impossible that the way they do it!
Well, you know, he was I suppose he was saying it.
in an admiring way?
He said there's no way you can get that sort of lift without.
whatever they do.

Oh yes.
Yeah.
Grey Greystoke.
Greystokes, was n't it la er.

Well it's about the erm.
a bandit.
who was on the side of the people.
There was a good Italian film made of this about twenty five years ago.

And gave some to himself.
Mhm oh yeah.
Mm.
Oh I know him, he's the.
Jose Perera.
Size of this bloke!
Good grief!
Not erm.
Cla erm.
Oh er Noel.
That looks like Terence Stamp photograph!
Stamp.
Oh no I read about that I've.
What breed is he?
And he's not English is he?
This actor.
Oh!
Juliano!
That was him.
Erm.
Mm.
Especially when it's like this, now they go outside and it's.
Well this is the trouble.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like.
I say, this time of the year, it's rotten!
Mm.
I mean they should be in the ruddy kitchen I suppose, but then you get to the stage where it's.
Is there any good having a ruddy dog, you know, I mean, why do you have one.
to start with?
You know, I mean it's.
Ooh there!
Ca n't hear.
Mm mm.
Seem to be a lot of German stations on it, are n't there?

Mm.

Must do.
Well I mean a film.
it showed you Michael Caine, well that was all dubbed was n't it?
You mean the documentaries?
Er, oh!
Er oh!
Mm.
The technology!
Kick your arse!
Yeah, some of them are good!
Trouble is, it's always the disappearing ones is n't it?
The doomed!
That was a cracker that Dimbleby did!
Done it with Susie.
The part where they went to the erm the what do they call it now?
The flooded forest.
flooded for six months of the year was n't it?
Well I do n't think it was a rain forest!
Was this the river that overflowed in this particular created this this lu.
Yeah!
All these creatures came out of the mud and.
Did you?
Mm.
Amazing!
Yeah.
Allsorts!
No.
Yeah when if the rains came and it started to er pour away, my God it was tumultuous!
Going down to the valleys.
Mm.
I think it must have been the.
About the trees?
Yes.
Ghana.
Good grief man!
Ooh hell!
Oh God!
Thanks er.
Ahhh.
Up.
And so unfortunately, it's the short term that's all they think about!
Mm.
Course it can.
At the moment they just.
I do n't think we had any cheese did we?
Ca n't remember that.
Gosh they're going again with Paul and Cathy.
Driving again and.
May was it?
It's when Car, yes, no ah.
Er I'm not sure.
Oh well it'll be a, that's.
I was born to a.
good life to.
Born to a good life.
Well it has n't happened yet but still!
I wish!
Better things.
The wrong handbag Ken, you was did n't you?
What happened?
We what?
Saying well here here's an ugly little bugger let's do a swop!
I have n't tried that.
Crumbly, is it?
Mm, that's distinctive is n't it the smoked one!
Very nice!
Yeah.
It's on do n't, they reckon they can make Cheshire anywhere now ca n't they?
No, it's not what it used to be.
Cheshire cheese is not necessarily indigenous to Cheshire now.
They make it in lots of places.
Well I do n't know about Devon, I'm not sure.
Only made in Cheshire?
Yes.
Making and you.
over the over the road into.
whatever.
Ai n't got any ruddy North Wales cheese or Clwyd, so what?
Oh yeah that was distinctive part of it.
I always remember going to, somewhere with Ken this girl gave us a lump of cheese, it must of been Cheshire.
They got this bloody knife and cut half the bloody cheese, I thought I mean, I'm not a polite person when it comes to food am I?
Must of had about two ounces on the bloody plate!
No.
And then, when he was eating the.
putting the marmalade on his toast in the hotel the knife.
Ooh, oh!
I mean you do that sort of thing at home do n't you, but.
Oh Christ!
It's just how he was brought up I suppose an.
Mm.
Oh there's a lot of that well done was n't there?
Well, ironically his creed was supposed to be without that was n't it Hitler?
You know, this supreme race but all more or less equal.
No, but the er the Germans they were the supreme body were n't they?
Of course.
And then of course the Air Force, they'd be one up again I suppose.
Mm mm.
Well this is.
Betty.
Terrible!
Biting before that were n't it?
Where.
they've had to close down the spi, and that.
This of course is exacerbated.
Like on the ruddy that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!
East Germany, poor devils they.
Well I said to Margaret, I wonder.
I wonder.
with the Western Groups after the euphoria of saying oh there, well we've cracked it now!
Are they now regretting it?
To some degree.
And, and the fact that they do n't know what's gon na happen, how to contain all this.
stress.
Did n't actually want it to go this far.
Oh I did n't mean that, I mean.
Well that's false economy that!
Yeah, but I do n't think.
Might work in our economy, but not in theirs I do n't think!
Well it has n't!
But instead.
of getting on with the five years plans they've put too much effort into producing war machines!
Well can we?
Look at America!
They've got greater means, I know.
Oh yeah!
Oh course!
Oh yeah, they colonised all these places but it makes you wonder, you know, you see all this unemployment and of course this John Major's in his answer now is ooh well it's the same everywhe, it's not, not here, it's everywhere!
They do n't say why?
Yeah, but why?
Exactly!
Exactly!
But I mean the have an excuse do n't they?
Course it is!
Say stop!
Yep.
and yet he said.
Well at the moment it's so dear.
to.
process it.
In the short term.
Ah.
That's expensive!
That's right!
But not saving to these.
particular firms.
that they want.
they must be selling it.
Mm.
It's only it's been cheaper to.
Well yes, because they're not.
Oh yes!
That's right!
Yeah!
But they do it in Canada!
Even even got one.
for plastic!
Mm.
Course!
But that's the key word is the long term Ken!
Mm.
But it's the short term is n't it, with them?
They just thinking well we have n't got the machinery to cope with this!
It's easier for us.
to buy the new raw material and process it.
and it ah.
but yeah, I know but the.
This is the way the government's got ta act now!
They wo n't!
It's a joke!
Mm.
Yeah.
Just wo n't look ahead!
Computer's the finest example of that produced.
in Manchester!
This government says ooh we ca n't afford that, no, it's a it's a gimmick!
The Yank says we will!
Bingo!
We could of held them to ransom!
I know, it is n't now!
Mm.
We're way behind.
Germany, France.
Russia.
Childish!
Oh yes!
No.
Same old stuff!
Mm.
No, I'm alright Ken, yeah.
They're all making money for themselves are n't they?
That's why I'm suspicious.
of the Labour party!
The big shots you know!
Money in the bank.
Whe whe when they're small they're Ken.
but once they get a.
Para power corrupts I know.
But, well it's what I've just said!
No you we, you was relating it to to power in this country to any country and saying.
it was exact, identical.
And that's what I disagreed with.
I I said.
you ca n't compare the ca, the power like just say in a place like Turkey which is absolutely rotten!
They got no law at all, or very little with, with the.
Ooh yeah!
I mean, if a little kid in the in the.
in the in the playground er.
You know.
coerces some kid into selling him his marbles, that's corruption is n't it?
But there are levels are n't there?
One one is more.
extreme than the other.
So we've got corruption in us probably so it depends upon the degree.
but you do n't expect to get out of the ruddy.
Socialist Party!
Because.
Have I discovered?
You mean have I seen.
on the television.
these people that.
talk with two tongues and say.
What happens when they retire?
Do they end up working the way we've got to bloody work here on this tiny pension or the pension that they've earned as an MP.
Well alright.
Harold Wilson, prime example.
rich man!
Lord Wilson.
socialist, I mean.
They're supposed to be against all that are n't they?
Well a man that's got more than one home for a start!
Because that's erm.
Now do n't talk ru, you know what I'm on about!
I do n't mean a bloody home like that!
Mm.
No, well talking to earn money, no!
If he er, if he gets paid by.
the hour.
Course it is!
Well i.
Well tha that that is.
worse is n't it?
But it's it's the degree.
How can that how can that man as a socialist justify earning well I do n't know what he gets, but we'll say he does n't.
get as much as Thatcher, say he gets forty thousand.
He's a rich man.
and he should n't be!
Mm.
Or how many kids he's got.
If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo, I need more than you!
So how can you possibly all earn the same?
Well you would n't have enough would you, to su sustain all those.
kids?
Why?
I ca n't see that!
No, I ca n't see the argument!
Well that's dictatorship.
Well that's, alright well well that's.
That's another argument!
Well fair enough!
But.
that is another argument!
It is, we're on the road.
Oh!
I thought your first one was everyone getting.
the same pay!
So.
Oh yeah.
I think the trouble is.
You see yo.
your.
well you did because your, straight away you go onto money which is our God is n't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
No, no.
but you're on about something else, you said the first thing I'd do, that's got nothing to do with Harold Wilson the first thing I if I were in power.
which.
Yeah.
no no no but I'm pa if.
I were in power there would n't be any money no need for it!
Then you.
would n't have all.
the arguments!
So you would n't.
say that at all!
But in the case of these people that start off.
Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells what's his name?
Beven miners.
Well I wo n't say Beven because it's a bloody shame what happened to him!
But never the less a lot of them started off like that did n't they?
Another one is Foot.
And as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree somebody has a talk with them so look here.
we know you're a socialist.
But er, you you we're gon na make you a nice one and join the bloody club so you'll be an armchair socialist and we look after you and that's what they are!
Callaghan is another example two or three homes big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people?
And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them!
Bloody big cuffs! cufflinks!
Saville Row shirts!
No, you have n't!
Foot never did!
Michael Foot?
Well you just said you just go you just said you've got ta give them a.
I did!
Voted for Foot.
He was, he was the Prime Minister!
Oh I know he put in there.
He should of been.
He should of been!
But the first.
bloody only the the way they should dress!
Oh!
I mean he's probably got more money than they've bloody got!
The it's all a blind anyway those rags he goes round in!
Well it's like.
What did Ken say about this chap from Vauxhalls?
Convena did all his work and they asked him to go to London you know, there's some was on years ago so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just could n't believe it, he turned on him and said you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!
Those lads down there they're fighting living on their ruddy strike pay and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing you know hypocrites!
And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good.
time you know.
Well if there i if there in a.
If they're in a corrupt society and when they get to that position they they do n't do anything about it and accept.
it and take.
the bribes, well yes I agree this is the.
the.
basis of the mafia is n't it?
I'll tell you, I'll tell you how.
Exactly!
Yes and you do n't modify you what happens?
Well.
No.
oh well, oh well apart apart from being.
elected.
apart from that.
Well you can use that for any argument then.
ca n't you?
Do everything the tories do because we're not gon na get in!
Well that's what they've bloody done near enough!
Mean time all the vil, all the mines are closing are they gon na say well yes well.
I mean it's.

What the mines?
Well they ca n't close the ones that's already.
gone in eight.
nineteen eighty one can they?
They've.
gone!
Closed!
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now.
so that's.
ca n't rescind that!
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
Yeah!
Well I've no doubt in twenty.
years time the tories will re-open them.
at at great cost to us!
Nothing to stop them!
I know I know.
Well.
but what happen.
alright.
what happen.
What happened in nineteen eighty one?
What did Bob say about the miners?
When, you know when that strike was on but it's like a lot of people.
Ooh that.
bloody lot of, bloody.
lot of clowns!
Arthur Scargill bloody clown!
Now.
those fellers fought to keep those mines open and they got one of lot miners divided and said oh bugger them!
The fellers in the Midlands was it?
Yo er Notin.
Nottingham round there?
Ooh bloody no.
and they ploughed twenty five million into their mines and said your jobs are guaranteed now fore, forget it you know, you're alright for thirty years what.
Now they're closing the bloody things!
Now, you know we sho something should of happened then they should of prolonged that strike to destroy these buggers and said no you're not gon na close them!
But the peop lot of people agreed with it!
They said they were n't being.
realistic!
Yeah but why should bloody intelligent people go along with it Ken?
That's what gets my plate!
No I mean, I'm talking about the people who are not actually er, you know.
concerned directly but give.
their approval for these.
people.
Yeah but I mean.
I know!
Exactly!
I know, well there you are!
This is what terrifies me!
The Mirror.
Yes.
You got no bloody chance!
But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
You know, but they should be criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody do n't!
Oh they criticise Ken, yeah.
Well you read your paper do n't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer.
which is, they get some they do some pretty good.
Oh no they're or there's certain ar.
a certain subject or.
whatever that's been thrashed.
That's right.
Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example.
the low wages.
we, we have n't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France I in.
Italy.
No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about.
the.
places you can go to.
which is a fallacy.
No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy.
Down there, there's a good boy.
Joking are n't you camping?
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Yes.
Oh I see, yeah, yes it's.
It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol.
and then the ferry across.
Yes.
Oh yes I think so a good thing you're inviting Ken did n't I to come with us?
Did you to Ken?
We did n't come into it.
Well this was erm Bulgaria.
Mm.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly would n't you?
Yeah.
Well I mean you're only doing it for him really are n't you, that's the idea was to help him.
But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility.
Italy.
Yes Florentine.
or near Venice.
Yes.
What they got.
Yes that's a point.
that's a point, yeah.
even if we.
went away for the weekend we could ask him along could n't we?
I wonder where there is a cheap place to.
where you can old furniture.
No I do n't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture.
all furniture.
mm.
Oh there yes, no I meant in this country.
I do n't think, I do n't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find.
A lot, yeah.
Oh you see a lot of them from erm.
paediatric coast do n't you?
You see them for Rome do n't you?
Is it tours?
Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm.
Catonica.
Rimini, Catonica all on the.
coast, which is er the Black Polish is n't it?
Oh yes the.
the very big lady.
Gosh.
does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it.
But I still like.
I still like to know how they staple it.
It must be an operation or.
Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples must be.
sounds a bit drastic.
On the concept yep.
That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise.
Yes it's er.
Oh yes.
No.
Oh I see these one that they send in.
Yes I er.
I do n't go a lot on them myself.
Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name.
about the gas and that.
Mm, very poignant.
anti war.
Oh yes, oh.
That's right yes.
Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now.
horrible.
There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs.
which are supposed to be erm.
seventeenth century.
They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually.
you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on.
and the guy that's faked it has done all this.
as he thought, authenticate it.
Stressing it, yeah stressing it.
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable.
contortionist, it says here.
Mm.
Well I mean to the untrained eye with a, this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish.
which it turned out to be wax.
to simulate old varnish you see?
So then he started looking.
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers.
Mm, quite expensive as you say.
Mm.
Yes mm.
No I have n't read that yet.
Mm pick on you.
Come on E T, come on babe, come on, do you want to go out?
Go out?
Wait a sec, let me get my yeah wait a sec, let me get my coat ah, down stay down, good boy come on, OK, OK, you're going now, yes.
Taking for walkies Margaret.
Are you coming?
I see, I'd just thought you'd might like to go.
Right lassie.
You wan na go to the shops now or what?
Yes.
Do you need to come or.
Mm.
E T wo n't hurt you.
Hello there, this guy is that nervous honestly, he loves other dogs, but er, they seem to frightened him, you know, he's a, till he gE Ts to know them then his OK, you know?
E T, come on, he's only young your chap is n't he?
Yeah.
Oh no.
Fixed him up alright?
Mm, how'd he manage that?
They just.
Oh god.
Yes, it's er infection really is n't it?
And if he's anything like this guy he's all go.
E T will you give over, come on.
He was ill treated you know, and he was.
we got him from the rescue, animal rescue you know.
so he's a pa, he's a bag of nerves really, but er, most of the time he's great, but, I think your, your one's a bit too boisterous for him.
Take care anyway, come on E T.
That's right, yeah, yeah.
Oh he said er.
Oh, where you been?
Oh just, oh I see.
holiday at home?
Mm, mm.
Well it's always nice to be at home is n't it?
Please yourself.
Hello there.
how's the family?
Yeah At one time we could n't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and.
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh ca n't stop today.
said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever said I'm in a hurry then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er.
A spaniel which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T.
Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he did n't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide.
then he was watching him like this then he ran.
ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know.
I said he he does n't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he did n't bite the, bite the other one.
he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches.
so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know.
stop him getting dirt.
in it or whatever.
Yeah, erm, it's worth waiting to.
I saw Mr Bentley.
and er he has n't got any stuff there of course.
but er, he said oh try the guy.
the chap in Mold, whatever his name is.
I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well.
so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the.
Mm, I do n't think so but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all.
said er, they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er.
Yes.
Hawkesbury hall.
by the school, yeah.
Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe.
Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it.
but er.
he said they've er.
Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got.
giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if.
Mm.
it's a joke is n't it?
you know.
several of us at college.
you would think.
tell me that much.
Well that's the thing yeah.
getting in a little bit.
There's about six I think.
Even so, yeah.
Oh they've probably got this much you know.
he, he got.
Oh I.
No that's what you've got ta, you, he showed us.
said the stuff you're using is.
old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?
You know.
Oh no you, you can use this, but you.
do n't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says do n't even use that.
His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can.
put, and then wax you see, now this is what we have n't seen yet.
waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see.
but you can.
that's what he does, but, if he want, I do n't know, he have to.
That's already done innit?
He started just after me, yeah.
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the.
or.
he will.
Oh easily.
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water.
erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole.
so if you just put the.
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere.
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Hello, hello, hello.
oh he's in here.
he's by the radiator are n't you beaut?
He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal are n't you?
Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it.
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes.
one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document.
to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along.
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical.
you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see.
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that.
You're only, you only.
putting that much in.
in this, in like a pint.
That's the trouble, I do n't need a ruddy gallon.
and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon.
Bob's.
Aye.
I thought, I thought the other one had got it.
When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box.
you do n't see erm doing this but, well after that, I mean.
they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and is n't it tablets or.
bottles of.
There's a jar already done, you just pour it in.
Ninety percent probably.
The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and.
which are all, er what they called?
Oh their own, yes.
where you do it.
Er well I was gon na ask for.
when he comes, gon na ask or ask.
They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area and.
the chemist.
he's an old fashioned type.
He's bloody finished now.
Mm.
Look in the pockets you great pi, oh.
Oh jesus, Maggots I caught a few.
there might be a fiver in one of them.
Hey did you know this.
I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, do n't they?
Right I'm going to work in the workshop.
Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two.
No.
Let's turn that down.
Power is n't it?
I do n't know.
Fantastic that.
pause.
See how she goes.
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them.
Possibly have.
stones.
enough.
the nails in the wood that's all.
Say this er I think.

I got the height of the base, you've seen that.
Use that for the base obviously.
it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom.
Yes.
er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to.
Yes I know he wants it erm.
glazing bars.
What re-cut you mean?
Cut them they would n't be the exact size.
I do n't know it depends er.
Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead.
it suppose to be the.
bars, I do n't know what they look like without.
old, old er.
Yeah.
No there's some there.
Are you gon na left that battery on.
It just drops in there does n't it, hanging.
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom.
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it.
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like I made the cab some cabinets you know.
Which way?
Oh on the deep.
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic.
Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep.
Yeah, but you wo n't get two out of it will you?
But.
I.
I, I like them.
Yeah.
you wo n't get two that size will you?
Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there.
Yeah, yeah.
It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down.
Yeah,.
a band saw are you now are you?
Yeah.
No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos.
twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to.
and the whole band saw got ta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in.
No.
I.
Yeah it's a.
I do n't fancy doing by hand.
No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before.
You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I do n't know.
Yes, yes, oh yes.
Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.
that's right, yeah.
I think.
bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day.
How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?
It must of had a good iron in it.
Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me.
and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry would n't they at least?
They'd take a long time to dry would n't they, then, on the sticks and that.
stacks of it.
Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see.
for pupation, yeah.
I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart.
used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it.
must of had a knife or something to it, sliced was n't it?
Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub.
this is going back.
I, a cut.
on the diagonal.
you see, a diagonal, the.
raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,.
but expensive that was.
cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in.
this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced.
because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I do n't know, very hard.
I would n't of thought so.
I'll have to find out of this.
that's the oldest part is n't it?
That's right on the knife.
whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer.
Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah.
But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish.
Mm.
Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was?
That's right, yeah, he's, he's.
Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here.
this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway.
as a joiner.
and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful.
the er.
knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said.
say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous.
ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on.
a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there.
You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er.
we, we did n't know what was going to happen.
that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now.
One of them said er.
when they start bringing the.
yes, yes that's right, lower.
lowering the taxes.
Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business.
cheap labour.
you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er.
Well Nor you ca n't help me on this me old son.
it's a shame really, no he bought about erm.
about erm ten of these and then the head.
So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma.
Beeswax was it?
Pure beeswax, what else?
I bet that was a.
I've forgotten now.
I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure did n't he from somewhere up North?
Oh.
Well I'd try Time and.
I'll find out anyway.
and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff.
Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere.
That's a good one is n't it, dear me, that's er.
Post it, but then they're gon na charge are n't they?
VAT and for a small amount it's not worth it really.
Hello Ken.
those boards trying to get them split down you see to make some, you know, shelves and that.
Well I'm not sure really it did n't seem to go to good on the cast iron nails you know the long ones.
Well I do n't know until the, when it comes to college you've got a hand one.
but er.
So anyway Norm mentioned about going to this one at erm Old Tammy, that one on the Old Road.
he said try there, they've got some old wood he said, well perhaps they're used to cutting all stuff.
You're not very choosy.
money for them sort of things.
that's the way I look at it.
There's no other way.
No, no, no, he does so many days Ken.
I do n't know perhaps he does, I do n't actually know Ken, I thought the way he was talking though that this chap.
had actually taken him on that he used to know years ago and had finished the.
I know it's a couple of years ago before he came here.
but this chap he's known for years.
mention the name.
he gave him a job, er.
erm, but I mean I, I was given to believe he was full time he never said oh it's so many days.
cost I think that.
Let's have a look.
French polish.
right, erm, where's this beeswax?
They're all in one together.
It's the same one, is it, are the, is that an update?
Oh these are, I see, yes, yes, yes.
Brunches, no, ah it'd be a.
Five oh, oh that's not bad.
It ca n't be right fourteen pound a pound can it?
That's wrong.
Perhaps he meant five hundred pounds you think or whatever.
erm.
a mahogany, oh gee whiz.
but she said that they were the same price.
but erm,.
good grief what is that I wonder?
gee, grief, that's six times as much, you'd have to have something for brown stains would n't you, you could n't just use them er hand like, but, but is brown mind you but erm.
What about the erm, be you know beeswax, beeswax have you got that?
There you are, oh that's a.
one that's made up.
Oh yes.
That's the one we want is it?
That's half a kilo, six eighty.
What about the oth the erm, what is it the pure.
He just says beeswax does n't he in his.
Yellow is it?
I see, yes, yes.
er and, and what about the paraffin?
That's cheap.
Oh well oh well I think that er would be a good proportion to er Morell's, but then we got to, anyway, excuse me I must go somewhere.
Right I want all that lot cut up for.
Ah I done this.
I said to Norm I cut some walnut not, not that long of course from the deep.
No, no.
Oh Norm yes at his old place, he had er.
three machines a great big saw and.
and all this but er.
business.
He's got a lot to do now you see.
yeah but he's got to the stage now as if yeah he's not gon na do a lot, whatever he did before at home I'm not sure but er he's done all his windows and stuff like that but I think then again he can do a lot at work you see.
Cutting and all this.
there's the machine, he done it, bring it home and assemble it so, not too much on the heavy side.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah eh we could have a.
with you underneath.
There's no need for the pits, we can have a series of trestle.
out in the fresh air and have to.
had to blow the dust off you.
well, and Margaret could even go.
every time I done the down stroke.
like that idea?
Do you like that?
Dogs.
there's a system there with a, a bone, every time you move that you'd move a bone and they'd go down.
the one on the top.
I just wondered if you'd remember, you know.
This is the other thing you've got to start remembering innit Marg?
I do n't even remember to look at the calendar.
Once you've got to do it, then you do it.
but if you leave it to somebody else well you never done.
Fancy telling him that.
How many lads at that age remember?
I never used to, you used to?
Mm, you.
anyway, when your mum was alive.
I've forgotten what day it was now, what was my mum's birthday?
Was it?
Oh your mum's.
I was gon na say, how does he know that?
You would n't of known that.
it was before your time I reckon.
Paul's in December, Fonz is er August.
Rob's is August.
Yeah, oh I do n't know.
Oh well he's moved on a day then.
What for?
I'd let it go by and.
Would n't say.
Loads of presents.
Oh big and expensive if you want.
Quantity and quality that's what I.
Oh it's nice.
Yeah you can tell he's not eating now.
Why not?
er,.
you've forgot.
I like a bit of a snack, we do n't have much at lunch time.
oh a few crackers or something.
It all depends Ken it's.
I've never found it very successful with big things, very.
I wonder what erm stuff for the cars do Ken?
Yes.
Great.
put a lamp on either side you know and put some in a crack, a lump either side.
I mean.
They do?
mm.
For who?
Yeah, but er, this is usually you've got to work on top of course you've got ta.
Oh you've got it off.
Oh I see.
Well the trouble is you can probably get.
replace a whole.
Oh yes yes, third party is n't it?
What's that?
It's a good castrating because it used to be a bit of a.
What's that?
Well it was once, once, I could n't see it again, but the music was beautiful of course, but then.
whether you want to listen to.
It was great, but it was I mean, I, I have to watch it because I'd never seen it before.
and I thought I'd watch it now.
Did you?
I, I do n't ever remember.
Yeah, it might be, yeah, it could of been a bit overpowering I think.
Did Kelly's kids watch it?
What do they say?
What did they say?
Cos I.
see it's not their scene.
I mean they would n't want to listen to the music I do n't think.
I mean ob, obviously the er, the lights of spring and the er dances of.
We all know this but.
some of it is very clever some of it, the effects and when you think back to nineteen forty one whichever.
You'd never get away with it today.
you could n't make it today and get away with it.
oh, it just would n't.
at all.
and of course you'd, you watch it over sort of sentimental or what have you, but I, I could n't watch it again I do n't think.
I can listen to the music.
I have n't got some of the music but.
And of course it was Stokowski was the conductor you see.
he was a big name at the time, Laepol Stokowski.
but erm, I imagine what's his name would n't do it, Walt Disney.
the M B C.
Oh it was very good.
Well I, I had n't heard of it on the telly, I.
with you yesterday, Jessica Tandy, erm Green Tomatoes.
Cafe or something.
Look at this, it ai n't very good.
Oh she's.
She's ninety two she is now, ninety two.
Yeah she was in the.
The Birds, was n't she that film called The Birds.
only a small role in that but she sort of had a late arrival.
Oh on the stage, yeah, but in films she came in later and only had small parts and never made.
much impact until this, one about the chauffeur did she.
Have you seen it?
Oh.
She's in that.
was n't she er Kelly Maguinness about the Macarthy business that.
The House on Carol Street was it?
Yeah.
she was the old lady that sort of let to read to her.
mm, then again she did n't have much of a part in that.
no.
A play.
what play is that.
How old is he?
She's got very severe though has n't she, you, never comes over erm a sympathetic character, she's always playing the.
Like that one in Carol Street that was a type she played that one.
always thought of rebuking the girl, so.
the slightest thing and.
very little humour.
Well that's it.
I thought I would go and take one of the head ones and journey along down to that place and so, you know, is there any chance you slipping me down a good four long ones and if he says no, think again?
About fifteen quid I think for a small one this chap said, it's very cheap.
No.
they're only a plastic job I would of imagined.
it's only that long.
Well I've no idea, you know, I mean he all he does is all timber so I imagine he's dealing with a quite a lot of old hand made nails and.
Oh I, I think he said they only fifteen pounds, those tiny ones.
That's what he uses, cos I mean he would n't be doing stuff like this anyway mind.
I would n't of thought so.
Well if he gets an old piece of.
or he wants to plane it or.
whatever he wants to make sure that he's.
cos well even the chisel he could knock, knock a lump of chisel could n't you with a.
chopping away there's a, there's a nail in it.
not this sort of thing you would n't as I say.
he would n't of been touching it with this.
So.
About an inch and.
It's er three quarters is n't it.
and five eighths whatever, I'm hoping to get two.
two shelves out of it you see.
Well that's what I'm trying to get these.
to do you see, that's it, it's about that, that wide, and doing that by hand.
No I did those others just to.
I got one side and then you turn it over, you keep to the line all the time you know, so the two cuts meet.
most times they do, sometimes they.
That's how they used to do it Ken.
this chap with his book he says watch out of it George it burns you, look in the corner and get your torch, you know, maybe you're going to an antique place.
get inside, sometimes.
where it has n't, the plane has n't, he said he can see and he tells you how to.
And you've got different sort of saw marks some of er them.
saw, which er, is obvious a machine, they even had band saws apparently at the end of the last century, cabinet makers band saws oh I've never seen, all I've ever seen is the big ones for mills you know the logs, these ones for er, obviously for timber erm.
and then of course there's.
you can see the mark on it, that one's a curl is n't it?
But er, pre, I thought you were talking about George the first something like that then you've got er hand sawn timber, you know you can see the marks on the board.
some of this has gone on.
No.
That's right, yeah.
No.
no way is this gon na come out.
Mm well you think all those years.
Yes.
this chap said in his book about.
and his screws, touch it with a soldering iron something hot, you know, the head in it, it'll get warm and sort of sometimes cracks the, separates the rust from the.
outside of the screw.
you to start otherwise your head snaps off does n't it?
You would n't of thought of putting a soldering iron on there would you?
He does have some good tips this chap.
The one by this chap teaching.
you know he's written the book Michael Bennett.
I've bought it yeah.
Well I thought I'd borrow one or.
bloke that came to er, theatre closing on a Sunday, a once a monthly.
fifteen quid's not bad.
they're for sale in America, Australia, Canada.
Oh no, I hope that.
oh no, I do n't think they would be.
A lot of people interested now you see amateurs.
you know you see them on the telly, do n't you, housewife with er.
oh absolutely oh yeah.
But then again a lot of people would n't dream of doing anything, they go and buy some but er there are.
Oh I'd have a go at that.
Oh yes I wonder if this fellow sort of does take the erm mystique out of.
a great extent, they said we'd try to get some chemicals this morning from him.
You said ring old Bentley up did n't you?
Yeah.
He was as.
did n't he years ago and the big kids sort of, well not torment him, but he's for the fun you know.
Always used to go on a Sunday messing about.
a big str, a bit strong fellow to he had good legs on him, he did a lot of cycling you know.
but the big kids used to jump on and all, he used to laugh like.
oh as you say a bit of a character.
I offered to help he said he's got a mate to help.
I do n't know whether he thinks I'm gon na.
mm, oh unless Kathy did she say he thought.
I was work, going to school.
One of the police fellows, you know.
Oh with still aches and pains.
Great, good god.
Bouncing with energy.
Mm, mm, Margaret it's her feet, huh.
she gets out of bed and she's like this.
yeah, that's right, yeah to lean.
Shoulder mm.
Mm.
It must be awful thing and of course you tend if, if you have n't got it to tend to think for god sake, you know it's a, it's a nice day.
mm.
Yes, yes, yeah.
That's right.
yet you never seem to show it here, do you, once, once you're going.
You know some people I mean er, er they're really bad.
they're, they're, they have to sit down.
for a, days do n't they?
But they say exercise is a bad thing if er the joints are infected, but the joint.
Yes, you must.
Coffee.
well we do, yes, that's bad for you.
Yeah vile though is n't it?
Oh.
No, no it's an acquired taste.
Oh yeah, that's better, erm.
but of course it's.
some of the young people have got it, my, I mean my son is only twenty nine and he's got it you know in the shoulders this er.
er, now he does n't like to talk about it you see, and I said to him one day look Paul for god sake, oh, he'll tell his mum, but he does n't like to talk about it to me.
which is bad really is n't it?
Mum.
that's right.
Yes.
that's right, funny is n't it?
Yeah.
yeah, it is, yeah.
Just that mum.
but it's, it's all cos you know younger perhaps.
it's still all there, is n't it?
Yeah, even on the phone our Rob rings up and er, he'll speak to me for a few minutes and he speaks.
yeah is mum there, or, you know, oh.
or she'll have two talks to him, when I've finished, but mum on again.
what have I done?
No, no, it's just.
it's how they are.
No, in Weymouth where my son lives.
Yeah, sells half tubs and erm fittings for the old houses, floor boards, doors, bit of furniture.
they're very cheap, they do n't seem to know their value that, I got those two Ercols there.
got the rocking chair, a wardrobe.
Forty pounds for those, they cost me about a hundred pounds those you know, the materials.
They cost me about a hundred pounds altogether with the materials.
Yeah, yeah dining chairs, six dining chairs they cost me seventy, I spent over thirty already on materials for the top material the foam you know it's, everything's so dear now is n't it?
what can you do?
Well.
yeah, I know, yeah that's right yeah, you ca n't skimp, you've just got to pay it.
You ca n't skimp.
if you want to do the job correctly, er it's no good buying very cheap material if it's gon na ruin the chair is it?
So you might as well splash out and.
hope you get the money.
She kept them, yeah, yeah.
I you were saying, yeah, yeah oh I know the the good stuff.

Good job you've got marvellous men at home, is it true ladies?
Are you listening to this?
Oh yeah.
hang on to him, hang on to him.
Alright Norm, I've got fixed up.
I thought I'd let you know, he's a handy chap that, the wood.
Yeah.
I thought he was gon na say no this guy but er, erm, what's his name?
Steven.
he said er is it your own, what is our wood he said, what I said no, he said er.
he said you know what is it and I showed him a piece like, he said oh I he said yes, I said I've taken the nails out that I did n't see, he said oh I've got a metal detector here.
a proper one, hi Holly, alright love, so I went, left it and then I went called back last night after college and he said oh I have n't done it yet come on he said we'll whiz it on the band saw, put it on the band saw and he'd taken two nails out that you could n't see you know the, the old stamped cast iron ones, the ends had snapped off.
there inside the wood and he dug those out.
Oh I yeah, he got this, this er must of been a good metal detector you know.
Three pounds that was for doing four of those long lengths you know and, and a short one.
which I hope might.
No, well actually, he got a load, what was I gon na say, he got a load of old pine there you see.
yellow pine, but they're all sizes, I said oh I said you've got some nice old pine, he said oh there's two guys come use it for furniture.
two big firms, that's all he.
Ah.
Exposed.
Mm.
it's beautiful too.
Ha, ha.
Oh yeah treat them you see, treat them worm holes.
No.
well it's full of erm full of resin you see and.
the woodworm do n't seem to be too keen on it does he?
They're, the woodworm do n't seem to be.
do n't like the taste you see.
oh it's too, they like sweet wood.
Mm.
The frame work.
Marvellous ah.
all those years.
oh yeah.
Mm.
but that's there's.
Oh I.
well this chap says there's er, oh he says how much is, he said oh he says, nine by one pound, pound a foot, I said good grief pound a foot, so I mean start talking about six by threes.
Oh yes.
Oh.
a little bit of foresight was n't it for those days?
Yes that's right.
Oh god, mind you it is all relative is n't it?
Yeah, that's right I mean he.
It's still cheap really is n't it when you.
Oh I do n't know.
Oh yes.
oh near the new what's.
Cor ten times.
that is.
But have they always been able to machine it Norm I mean to my mind it's always been sort of, you know, you buy, whatever they are like for afters and that and that's how you use them to make your garden shed or whatever.
whereas it looks as though, you know this chap, they found a way to make sure there's no metal in it and now the machine it.
yeah must of done.
De-nailing.
that's right, yeah.
tab them all.
yes.
that's right.
yeah, but that, that was the main usage.
was n't it?
But you see now, the shortage of good timber.
now they use them for furniture.
No, I'd better get back Hilda.
she's erm.
put the kettle on there, I'll be in trouble.
Yes.
perfect.
it was perfect for that.
Yes, yes.
Mm.
Oh.
Shame.
mm.
Well did you ever go, what did you say.
It's a terrible name for me, where did we go last week?
Nan, Nantwich.
Ah and the antique shops there.
there's one chap there erm no he did n't say it is, er Adams, I said to him you got, you have n't got a place in Chester, that's another Adams, no, no he said there's no Chester, the stuff he had in one, he had a, an oak settle, sixteen something, now there's wood worm in that.
but the shine on it.
and it was just being polished by hand, you know, christ.
Oh dear I'm in trouble now.
I'm in trouble now.
I'm very sorry.
Have you spoken to him?
We hope, hope.
Hoping that you say it was raining and er.
Have you done a, is this different Norm or.
Norman is this furniture.
Is this furniture different is it?
No, I.
Oh you took.
You go into and lounge and it's just moved every couple of days is n't it?
Oh.
That's right yeah a little entrance hall.
That's right, yes, yes, going into the, going in the hall.
which is a terrible idea I think.
I could n't believe it when I first saw it.
I thought it.
It's hard to imagine.
Oh what have they, what's he done in there?
Yes, oh yes.
Yes, that is.
Now did you say you've got the same trouble as us with the conden, condensa.
Have to try and get, to get one of these trays I think and try that.
oh.
no ours is a, no ours is a, we had, ours only three years old, so er, yours actually.
Oh no, we've got a space under ours.
it's not a modern one yeah, yes.
Yes that's right.
Oh I see, yes, oh that's better than really.
we've got the hall underneath of ours.
I have asked a couple of guys at the college you know and one fellow said the tray, oh he said, you can buy this tray from a builders, oh he said you can make a, a cover and I said oh god, make it the same colour as the mat and the er.
the damage.
Oh I would of thought so.
bloody awful.
ours, you can smell ours in here, I mean you can smell.
sometimes you know damp.
and that's all it is.
Ah what's going on here?
Oh you see, no.
see their toilet.
it's co, it sits on there.
ours does n't, ours, you can get your hand right underneath ours.
not an old fashioned one.
but the diff, there are two different types are n't they Norm?
Oh yeah he said.
you'd have to see.
Oh yours is a, I, but, how's the, of course we've got skirting board in ours.
and it's, it's.
Oh that's nice.
Oh so you've got no bath now.
you'll have to have one in the sink.
It looks nice there Norm we had one similar to this did n't we?
But we had.
we had enough room did n't we for them both.
Terrible idea actually.
it's a better idea though is n't it.
ca n't you?
I, that's an i, oh there's the two walls you see.
yeah that's right.
cos normally the, normal the joist are n't strong enough are they?
well it does n't, see it makes any difference yeah you've got ta.
Let the light in, that's an idea yeah.
oh it's easier innit, to get to the room?
It's so much easier.
I'm surprised Geoff has n't told you this over the years.
it's er, there you are I suppose.
see some guys would have to get somebody in to do the lot would n't they?
Not everyone can knock a wall out or turn their hand to it.
I'll have a go, it does n't, I do n't say I do it right, but I'll have a go.
that's handy that is n't Norm, yeah, have this for a den.
and know it.
Oh I that's nice, yeah.
Ooh I'd love that kids.
It's like the little one said last, she said, can we come and stay here for the weekend you know, and stay up in Aunty Bonnie's room, they call upstairs, and Margaret's face she said, well er, my god she's got some good stuff up there you know, furniture.
but er, they would n't do any harm like.
I suppose.
But the first thing they do is put the video on, they know how to work it and everything.
Yeah.
Got this video game now, they know how to work all these.
and I ca n't stand the noise me, I hear it going beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
Yeah, you've got to have the interest ai n't you Norman?
That's all they know.
me, I, I got, I took me old three put out the other day and so they said got your.
got the college ones you know.
about ten now and they're all in this white ones are metric, she said what the hell's this she said, I mean I've had it thirty four, five years something like that, forty years.
what the bloody hell's this she said?
I said they're.
feet and inches, what do you want, oh, oh he said er, he's a fellow, he's a fellow of about thirty you know.
Yeah you can, yeah, but I think me in inches I know it's a.
Yeah, I'm not interested in it, it's stupid really, cos it's easy.
Oh, it seems as.
it seems a hell of a lot long way to me.
What you show for?
Oh I've seen this one, this is er, this is er Ame's is here.
post office there's a cosy cafe somewhere.
this is the post office.
all this has gone now.
Well can.

Aye, yes.
I do n't like wind, windy and wet if you're out, cos you can get really cold.
chilled, yeah.

Good grief.
What.
They're just bits of flesh, gee whiz.
Mm.
Good.
And they've got to open her up every time.
obviously.
So.
Ah, a big woman ah.
Solids.
And er.
Oh.
No life that though is it for a younger person?
Smartened herself up.
That's what you ought to do.
get that stapler, got one in the garage.
I know, yeah, tremendous are n't they?
No, not unless I saw that wedding that time I do n't know.
Bigger than Olive?
Mm.
No.
Mm, mm.
What is it?
Oh.
Does anyone ever ring the bell Carrie?
Does anyone, when they stand on the scales.
and those that are smaller their faces light up.
I suppose she was saying oh I ca n't get rid of it, all the other.
Oh it's nice it looks better.
I've had mine highlighted.
I'm gon na get style.
gon na see.
That one in erm, is it Lower Bridge Street, that Brian goes to?
He said it's nice, you get a cup of coffee oh it's great.
but they do n't do anything.
I mean see.
so what have they done, oh they put these, I do n't know what they do, they set it, or.
Are they bad those things?
no he just has a curls, seemed to be curls here.
He's so gullible, honestly Brian is.
That's what I say to you and you do n't like it.
do n't style.
they style it.
In my day, you got a short back and sides, everyone got.
everyone got the same.
It's horrible that is.
He's a.
Scott does n't he?
Naked.
yes, yes.
Mm, well he sh.
It's corrective you see now this is the idea of it.
as the, as his eyes are developing.
Oh yes.
Oh.
Coca Cola's.
What on earth did he do?
He's talking.
What happened then?
Mm.
Mm they'll see him.
and, they will eventually.
Nearly.
But they soon forget it.
They do n't give the cane do they?
My mum used to connect and hurt herself.
Some hand.
Ooh, there's cruel.
Yes erm.
anticipation.
Well no you could wallop them there and then I suppose.
Well they soon feel undermined, yes or, or the kid, the kid.
goes to the police.
I think it's I mean I heard, you hear these tales.
but I think it's as you bring them up is n't it?
If you keep at them and.
Yes.
You've got to be firm.
Yes she's very quite and sensitive is n't she?
you should say, takes after her mum.
it is n't.
Oh well.
You do get some kids though no matter where they are, who's house they go into that you know, strangers and they, they behave in a sort of a, a wild fashion do n't they?
Whereas most kids, I do n't know I think it's just the way they give them too much lead er, I mean our kids were always quiet were n't they when we went out?
When they were at home.
or somebody said do you want so and so, no thanks.
dying to have it.
You have to persuade them you know, go on.
which is good really.
Let's see what we can do with this one.
Mm.
Oh no.
It's hanging on by a thread.
Oh.
The Americans do that a lot.
Oh yes, yes, marvellous.
What on earth for?
What?
Problem is.
Oh.
Oh those are nice I like those.
Oh no.
God.
That's nice yeah.
That's a nice one.
That's a nice one that erm, pomme de terre.
but of course it's got eggs in it and it, it's no good is it?
Layers of.
layers of potatoes and erm cheese.
and then you pour the egg mixture over it and cook it.
Ah er no, er just eg, egg.
a couple of eggs.
with milk I think that's what it is.
but erm.
Yeah I suppose that's right yeah in, in a casserole dish.
Well this is it, it's dairy.
I suppose is n't it?
But the spuds taste lovely ooh.
but you've got to par cook them because they do n't.
cook quickly enough.
Ah you'll have to do what Ken does.
Made me laugh last night, he said erm I, I, I always do a load of spuds he said even if it's.
only him and then he said you know.
and then, and then I fry them then.
oh god.
eats, I'm sure he eats all the wrong stuff you know?
He wo n't eat any no, no, no.
He does n't eat much.
You see he wo n't eat veggies.
Wo n't eat any veggies you know, none.
He does n't.
An apple now and again but it.
peas about, yeah but he does n't, he does n't eat them much does he?
If had a plate of raw carrots.
Well I was gon na say he does n't.
if he ever ever comes to our house and you're doing stuff then he'll pick one wo n't he'll make a celery.
He does n't, well he'll have salad minus oh he does oh I think he will have a salad but he does n't like tomatoes.
They like a lot of meat.
Oh yes.
I mean.
they, they've always been known for marvellous skin have n't they, the erm.
continent because of olive oil, plenty of erm vegetables.
Got ta be pure olive oil.
How can it?
No I did n't, I thought it was all good.
Oh thought it came straight out of an olive it ca n't do any harm can it?
That's not much is it?
Yeah.
Got a small.
I, this is it you've got to get the er.
Have you?
No wonder then.
That's right, yes, yes.
Well the article I read in it, it said erm, you know you can drink gallons of it, I mean I do n't know.
You see the South of.
the South of France they said in the paper they eat a lot of butter or cook a lot.
the North it's all, nearly oil they use.
They cook everything in butter do n't they?
Yeah and makes.
I mean I, I.
No just good, bad.
Yeah but there's a lot of ambiguity about it is n't it, they you know they say this is.
the wholemeal or whatever.
and as you say you've only got ta read the small print you find that spent percentage of this and that.
Yes.
Mm.
this is the trouble.
There's nothing in it, yeah, we, we had a loaf once, sliced, brown bread and there was a line across it there, it was white.
We said god look at this, you know it looked as though it had been painted.
so it makes you wonder you know as you say.
is good is n't it?
Because.
oh.
Straight.
It's got all those little bits in you know?
That's good he's, he's off the white bread now is n't he?
It's abso, I ca n't eat it now.
Of course it does.
Yeah there's something in that you see, the white.
That's right,.

Mm.
Yes those are good.
Cocoapops.
Oh what's the other thing snap, crackle and pop.
Oh yeah.

Eh?
Nothing for a penny?
Penny a pound?

Water comes up like this.
Unsinkable, like the Titanic.
Ah, mm.
She fell in, it'll be.
a big wave.
in the shallow end.
Oh my grief.
Abstained or something did he?
Got to be realistic, is that what you always say?
Next time I get hold of him.
He's always.
Oh he does the.
he's alright.
He's got no clout has he?
Oh yes he's got a lot of local level.
local level they do er.
they do their best.
He looks like it.
No wonder you study the dictionary the other day.
Did Kelly said anything about this job?
Oh she's, oh so it's just in the er pipeline at the moment is it?

They were n't open.
Collingdale.
Well Margaret guided us to ruddy Conway in er, anyway, we got there and we had a bit of a bar snack did n't we?
It's over the road to it.

I liked it!
I must be nineteen fifty three the last time I went to Conway.
The cinema's still there but it's now, what is it, Bingo hall now?
saw the Eye of the monkey there.
Mm.
Is it?
Like I say, it's a long time.
And I said to Margaret, ooh I sa the smallest house in Britain, is is in Conway.
Cos we just went onto the front.
Mm.
It took you from to there!
You do n't open one window it's it sort of thing.
No.
It is an actual house, you know.
Free to go in and look round, I do n't think it's open.
Oh it's.
No it is n't, it's it's a le.
Well the door was wa was n't as wide as the walls was it?

On the end of the wardrobe!
Skinny people!
Yes, we do know that.
Tudor Rose.

Lost!

Queen's Ferry.

He could n't.
Even if it's somebody else you know.
so er.
It is a shame!
Like.
I mean I'd.
I'd teach him if wanted but er.
I think this is all maybe go for a while.
That's right.
Oh yes!
Well Margaret wo n't.

Near the pub.

What day is it?

Nice setting.
Give him a ring now.
Well in case you do n't see him, you know, in time.
Well I just thought sorry!
Mm.
I mean we we just.
we just do n't like beef now.
I'd eat.
a couple of slices.
You're having ro roast beef.
I'd sooner have cold meat than.
Well, I, no, I mean I used to love lamb!
Brought up on ruddy.
lamb for the weekend!
We always had a lamb leg of lamb.
Famous Welsh lamb.
And then cold lamb after.
That was tradition in them days.
That's what they did.
That's what people did.
You know we used to have some a while ago.

It's too fatty!
, it's probably our diet, it's what we get used to.
I mean we eat that much veg vegetables.
and chicken.
fish.
We probably get used to that.
Yeah.
And then they have steak!
Good.
grief!
Ah, but think of iron.
Ooh, I tell you what you want though.
couple of things for you.
You want water from, where was it I said to you?
From er.
No, no!
From nor, somewhere in Snowdonia they send this water all over the country and it's so full of iron Germany, they buy it.
But er, it's a good I do n't know about cure, but whatever!
The rheuma.
I told you on Su on Sunday!
Er, rheumatism, what else was it?
Something else like that, you know, but the iron in it is marvellous!
Because it's rich the.
the earths it comes out of so they're selling it by the bottle in Germany.
The other thing you got vitamin G was it?
D!
Oh no this is.
this is iron!
But they're doing a.
a series up in the er.
in the Observer you see, and they're telling you.
all these, the good.
How to live till you're a hundred you know, live a good life.
And this all the these things.
course the emphasis is on do n't smoke!
drink and all that.
plenty of er, you know pulses and cereals.

That's right!
Is it fortified?
No, I mean if er.
Oh, yes!
Yes.
That's right, yeah.
Oh yes!
Yes.
I mean ah, garlic to me is an unknown quantity.
And of course.
I do no, butter was n't it?
On the, on the ration then it was.
No, but it could have several cheeks, quite often yes.
Well it'd be hyphenated would n't it?
I thought.
Oh, of course!
You want one of these, is this any good this thing?
It's a mini computer.
Have n't you got a good dictionary?
With explanations in.
Has it got.
derivations in it?
Oh well then, that'll be in there!
Hammerstein?
I'd be inclined.

I've heard you selling the guy that showed you these two manifestos one by the Tories and one by the Labour and the one that stuck in my mind it's that the Labour Party will have a minimum wage to comply with the rest of Europe.
Tories saying, if they have a minimum wage it will tear a lot of people out of work.
What a bloody disgrace when you're in a democracy and they want minimum.
wage!
So you can employ someone for.
ten pounds! no law against the swines!
God help them!
Oh this is disgusting!

Hit my bloody shoe that will!

Mm.

Josephine!
Mhm.
What about sunflower oil?

Okay, love bye!
Thursday's about the worst day is n't it?
Tomorrow is great.
Ooh yes, Friday's not!
Ooh I think, yes!
Absolutely!
Yes.
It seems to be a.
heavy day!
Never mind!
Never mind!
What are you doing today then er Eric?
Ooh they're polishing, yes.
Yes can be a mistake hurrying the job ca n't it?
We've all done it.
Early?
Morning Mary how are you?
Is that you in the flash car pushing my little one out of the way?
Oh it's awful is n't it, on a Thursday?
It's terrible!
That's right.
I do n't think so.
Would of thought.
Yes, ah, these.
Oh I see, yes yes yes.
It's higher than the one I had because erm the base is obviously I just had the springs going across did n't I?
Mm.
That's right.
Yeah that was.
Yeah.
So you done it with springs, that's right.
yeah.
I mean a.
I would n't say I would n't say anything Gwyneth, to me i, I'd be quite happy!
But then Joan is speaking on how it should look.
Oh I see, too high?
Well it would n't be for you would it?
Those Ercoles that we got, those wing they're too they're too low for me.
Surprising, yeah.
No, they're not made for a tall man er, you know my.
wife's quite.
happy but my head's like this and I I bit disappointed really.
I thought that they were the wings were gon na come up you know, the, the old type that kept the draught off.
Which.
Well that's the thing you see but er.
No, but erm.
That's what I anticipated, but that, yes that's lovely!
Be quite happy.
with that.
Yeah.
She'll be al, yes, that's right, yeah, yeah.
The wings, are they?
Yes, I see.
Small, yes, they should of been a bit.
deeper really, so that the.
Nice!
Yeah.
I think she'll be very happy.
I think, you know in.
certain cases you've got ta say to Joe, well you mean that's what the lady wants now you know those Ercoles I did?
Well she convinced me to start off with foam, you know webbing on the foam and I said well.
she said it's a lot cheaper and easier, so I had n't got the springs at that time.
but then er somebody said do n't do that you've got ta think what the value.
of how it's.
supposed to me.
So.
in the end I persevered.
Mm.
Oh it's gorgeous!
That's why I love the sprung hair and the horse hair ideally, you know I love it!
Now that'd be better for me.
but then I as I say, you do n't cater for every height on the.
chair do you?
Mm.
Yes.
Well it, ah well, of course the other thing you'd have to do to do that is put a top.
Oh that's what you're doing is it?
Oh well!
So you're gon na give this a top stuffing?
Yeah.
I see, just one, I see yeah.
So all you want is a bit of erm.
Wadding.
Well that's great!
That's great!
So she can please herself ca n't.
she?
And you can make.
that loose.
Good!
You're happy!
Joan's happy!
Everyone's.
That's a good idea that!
You've got in effect, a dual purpose.
chair have n't you?
It's too low is it, for you?
I see yes.
Oh yes, I see, yeah.
Mm, yes.
It's that comfortable it's actually going off to sleep here!
He was erm very lugubrious moustache, and he looked.
oh that was the character.
he played, you see.
Yeah, but he was er, opening this thing, this particular day in Buckley so big name, you know ma, most of them they watch it all the time you see.
for the rats.
Ooh!
Excuse me, you've ha, you've tripped your and the you know, the all lad, he said, no it's not worth it for me, so I'll be going before you draw it.
That is true!
That is true!
Well I I was so shocked!
My God, all that money!
And he's.
No.
No, you know, the.
I mean most people here just said.
yeah, yeah not having it!
They go.
Not interested with the in the you have to give ten percent.
Another chap, he's a big name in a church in Buckley he was a an old neighbour of ours and I never liked cos he used to himself with a bowler hat on they are only back twenty years, you know, bowler hats!
I got in you know, on this guy he's oh no, no, he said he he'd got one at home, he said I ca n't afford blooming two!
And I'd got I'd bought one of his!
And I thought oh!
I pinched.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh yes!
No no.
Well I mean, he probably ate a horse or anything.
stopping this slaughtering shipping them over to the France or anything any more he's burnt their.
blinking.
It's disgusting.
Oh I usually give but I do get a bit tired of it sometimes!
When they get hold of me twice in the one day you say hang on I've just given to you the bus!
They say, all alright!
Are you having a a reverse effect?
It's the lady what's your name again?
No, I do n't yo, remember.
this with our like, first year last year erm, er she lives somewhere near Paula.
But she was a funny girl!
But erm very, very quiet, you know?
She was good on this!
But, she dropped out, but anyway I sa she'll say oh you're whistling are n't you, and singing?
I said, oh I lo I love it, I lo, I said I know it sounds awful thought no more and then Shirley said to me when she'd gone she said, she came up to me one day she said I wish to God he'd stop that bloody noise, this time!
So I told my wife, she said I told you, she said, you drive me mad!
No, I like to hear a bit of music to go along.
That's all.
It does n't sound like music to anyone else!
I'm sorry about that she said!
She's got no chance has she?
She.
You were stationary?
Not your car?
Oh I thought somebody.
said it was you!
But he was sitting in the car was he and and she came and back into him?
The golden rule is if you're reversing you must look behind you!
Yeah, but a it's too bad ee, yo yo I do n't know.
you when you learnt to drive when you came to reversing you're told you must look.
out of that rear window all the time not using your rear view mirrors look once as well.
That's what a lot of people do, the, they look once and then turn forward and bang!
It's fatal!
Cos anyone can whizz in behind you!
And she's got no chance if she told the truth!
Of course, the other thing, if she says oh well I er did n't know this feller was moving and er.
to thump him,.
Cheeky devil!
My God I would n't have the gall to argue would you?
You'd say I'm I'm sorry.
oh!
Ted is it?
Told her, Ted.
Yes.
And she's arguing?
In the butchering department.
So how you going, alright Ted?
Apart from the drama?
Yeah, Chris is er what's his name?
What's the forgotten his name now!
Is it.
It is n't Ted is it?
No!
It's gone now.
yes.
But.
How are you Fiona, alright?
So is it badly smashed this car or is it just the bumper?
She's got no chance!

Instead of her saying oh and what have I done, I'm sorry!
And he was stationary was he?
Well if he she's got no chance!
She was n't looking!
Oh yeah!
Bet she never looked!
Should never reverse unless you're looking out that back window!
Could n't have done!
I put the brake on and locked them, I should n't of done!
So the bumper's torn off the back.
the front wheel i, she'd gone sort of along it an, and.
hit the head and, and my front wheel it's always the front bumper!
And the tyre was going down then she said I did n't do that!
I said, what!
I did n't get you!
Only hit the bumper, I thought well what's happened, I said?
Look at the mark on the wheel!
Oh I, I did n't think I'd done that!
Now, she went off then, she heard my address, and my you know er.
Cheerio!
I'm stuck in the road!
I had to.
change the tyre, it's, you know I see it's the my God, I've heard some good-uns in me but people are like that you know!
They can wriggle out of something, they.
you know, they will!
Oh no!
Well was it dark or something?
Did n't she.

Oh dear!
Thirsty yes?

Mhm.
Lovely colour, but I like it.

And there's the speed!
Well, where John lives like, I forget the name of the road now, you just pass Thornton Heath you know turn.

and this this long road goes er must be two miles, more than that!
No, no, it's it's Thornton Heath, that's his address on the, just.
this road er, a few shops and then you turn left at John's road but er, and he there's two.
private houses, two bungalows that were built twenty.
years ago in, in.
amongst all these old.
ones you see.
But when you come to turn into his drive there's the ca, you know the cars behind you doing sixty odd!
Put the brakes.
on to warn them and then.
zoom!
And then when you wan na get out of his drive.
you've got ta have someone there to to back you.
out because.
And he said John said, oh yo, you can hear the bumps here all the time and the.
the buses and that, the these cars are parked on the pavement.

Well he he is he, he is quite.

He was only thirty thirty.
thirty six when he died you know!
Oh oh yeah.

A shame is n't it?
Beautiful!
Oh the dugout, sort of canoe, yes, the curved and.
Oh blue eyes!
Oh!

Do n't frighten the alligators!

Oh I see!
You get a surprise.
Where's it gone?
Well I do n't know whether you can sort of, tape in advance can you?
We, we ca n't, no.
No.
Son told us how to do it once, so he got the book out and he said, oh, then he gave up in the end!
Because er we tried it and we got the wrong ruddy film!
You know yo, it's all these buttons is n't it, you've got ta you've really got to be into it.
Oh I know!
Yeah.
Experts.
are n't they kids, though!
Brought up quick you see.
I do n't envy them though, I do n't.
I'm old fashioned and that's it!
I do n't know.
But i I must say I like it is a marvellous thing to be able to do that!
Just sit down and watch a ruddy tape you know and.
pre, put it in and.
I mean to say er used to see people years ago and they got these cine cameras and and all, we could never have one of those you know and a record of the kids when they were young.
And I mean.
You only got a few minutes did n't you?
Oh yes!
Well of course he would!
That's what he wants to see.
That's it.
Kids!
What can you do?
She has been in the business for about a year yeah.
Dressmaking mainly, but you know, anything at all, yeah, she's been at it that long!
But, but people when people when they come to your house and want things done they're tight you know!
Terrible!
They say it wo n't take you long!
A a skirt, how much is a skirt?
Well five pounds an well I only ee, you know.
I could do it myself.
And I sa and I said well why why do n't you?
She's given up now, she just does it for friends now the you.
know, that, who pay but obviously.
they're getting it done cheaply.
But some people are grateful.
God bless her!
Yeah.
Clientele, yeah.
Oh yes, I've Yes.
Yes.
I know, yeah, yeah oh my wife knows.
it quite well anyway.
Oh!
Oh yes!
Oh I see, yeah.
Had to make.
a few drastic alterations!
Ooh!
Oh, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely!

She does design or something.
Oh I see, yeah.
Oh she.
can design as well?
Ah that's.
that is very talented, yes!
Yes, I think, and also it depends on the area that you live, do you think John?
You know perhaps you're in.
Mm.
I think if she went in to live in the back woods, you know, way beyond.
sort of er.
as I say, you get good people that are quite willing to pay, but others who.
are they do.
they want it done cheaply because you're working at home!
The attitude, which is wrong.
really!
You know I sa, told Margaret, I said look do n't er I'm very sorry but we ca n't do it!
Yeah.
Yes.
They want it for nothing or or.
next to nothing!
They do n't want it half price.
they want it for a.
fifth!
Heating.
, yes.
And the work is tremendous.
doing that sort of thing, I'd, something I would never take but there you are that's people for you!
Like this game to some extent is n't it?
The furniture they want it somebody'll want it done for no.
I've broken many the dowel or tenon or something like that!
Erm.
Well, I mean, say it's like that where you just polishing with a cloth or something.
but he has a an actual syringe er, mortaring tenon you know.
Say that was a tenon there the underneath part of the chair you're not gon na see drills a hole in there.
and then jegs and after a few five minutes.
does n't get you know, it breaks down the glue inside.
No, no, you've been lucky there but.
it's a good tip that you know, is n't it?
I've never heard of it before.
Michael the erm the up, the furniture restorer that's erm he's coming here.
Three hours every Tuesdays for the second years.
and giving us tuition on real antique furniture, he does n't do anything in his shop erm after eighteen forty or it's all more or less Georgian, very Georgian actually.
In er Heswell I, I've never been there, he's got a workshop in Heswell.
No he co, he comes here.
He.
wants.
On on a Tuesday, he wants to go and teach you see, I think he's got arthritis in his one leg.
Yes.
Michael.
He's written a book.
We've all got the book.
Yes.
He's a lovely chap.
honestly!
Very, very interesting!
I.
Well he he sort of came and asked us, you know do you mind.
he he's got ta do this thirty hours I think it is to.
to get this.
other exam.
As I say, they he qualifies you see.
Er so it's mainly erm what I've just been telling you about cleaning all.
screws, how to identify furniture and mainly ol and his methods are totally different to what we've learnt.
here, especially with polishing.
and that.
Uses hardly any polish it's nearly all waxing though.
Stripping and everything's a different technique.
But he.
Yeah, ah that's right, yeah.
Well er, the Tuesday is supposed to be furniture restoration, that's what it's been.
but then he started doi you know, a few weeks ago it wa, well it'll be the fourth week I should think!
Fourth.
Well that's the the three day, you know, George i he's.
No, Bill does n't go in!
No,.
This is just woodwork.
Ah well we do a bit of copying.
The first years come in here for upholstery.
We go in there to the woodwork.
Tuesdays.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a fiver each that is.
Some.
Well, I I liked it, you know it's it's so interesting and er he is very good!
Trouble is, some of them have made the mistake I think, of saying well it's not good for us because we do n't do really old furniture you know.
Nobody's gon na come to us for the lease of erm William the fourth or anything like this!
Or William and Mary and say er can you do, they're gon na go to an expert like him.
You never know, you might have to do a top of an.
old, really old.
table.
And not just go on and strip the.
which.
he's still really tha that's a.
of him that is.
Do n't, never use that stuff!
Makes his own wax!
Showing us how to.
we're gon na do some between us.
Oh no!
No, just cli, and yesterday he'd got this marvellous cleaner he uses.
Cleaner and then er wire wool at at the last.
resort.
but oh he he, he does do stripping obviously but the.
the stuff he uses is ve is n't as caustic as the stuff we.
use.
It just takes the surface off.
And then th, the object in the, is to build up a pattern.
there you see, so it still looks old.
And he.
does a lot of patching, somebody's got a cigarette hole you, you've got ta match that up.
Very interesting!

Oh well, yes, yeah, oh well I would n't be coming.
That's right.
It's part of my second year, so yeah I know.
So I'll be in the same boat as you next year.
Well yeah, I've had a come for one day, pay for a day and hope I can sneak in on the two day.
That's what.
you can do.
I mean, Joan said well ma, you know make the numbers up, once you're here come in on the second.
Well that makes up.
Well you see Eric was offered two months.
Little Eric, the one that's always.
in there.
So the let him come in the day, two days he was off two months, Christmas time,.
with his bad back.
Tha, well he went to Spain for a month to sort of recuperate.
And and come in on the, he came on the Tuesday and he's been three days a couple of weeks so.
Between friends I think.
Ooh yes!
The wings go on last do n't.
they?
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry Pat, what?
No.
Yes.
Kept this space.
specially for you Pat.
With you in mind.
Well erm Mary's.
here so she can budge up a bit.
There's usually another guy here today so he has n't showed up, so there you are so we got bags of room.
From what I've heard she'd got no chance that lady!
Well yes.
As long as you're alright.
Yes, well it is!
Yo you sort of er if you ran into someone you know, you do something silly it's it's it's it's automatic to say oh I'm sorry we will you know how much.
?
But today, especially these youngsters the attitude is I'm.
not saying anything!
Now it's sticking out a mile, but the time home that make up another ruddy story to give.
to their insurance I mean.
it's awful.
But.
Yo you were stationery were you?
She got no chance!
You ran into a, I mean if she's reversing.
She's not looking, she could n't of been looking!
She's she's looked then she's taken her eyes off the back.
Must of!
Could be.
I mean I I.
Mm.
That's fatal!
But I I was always taught, probably like yourself that you must look through that, turn round and look through that rear.
mirror.
Cos if you take your eye off for a second, bang somebody's there!
So I do n't think she's got much hope now you know.
Have you got.
witnesses anyway?
Oh!
There's the insurances and the tale that she tells them but tha, I think they'll have that weighed up you know.
Ha!
Cos I had an awful experience about ooh, four years ago, I had this old Moggy Morris Minor coming along very slowly north of Hull it was and this chap and his about finished work you know, so I going past this cri, there's a cricket match going on and he was looking like, I could see and his girlfriend!
And the car just went like this into the middle of the road slowly towards me I swerved onto the grass.
verge and he caught my back bumper an an ripped it off you see!
Got out the car, said good God lad what were you doing?
And he never said anything and he said something like, I'm not saying anything.
I said you ran into me, look at the position of the cars!
Ooh no, he said we'll swop insurances that's all he'd say!
It was his dad's car.
His dad was on holiday.
Anyway, I, I should of got the police there and then and had.
him breathalysed although it was n't.
drink or anything but.
police said to me afterwards you should of we ca n't fight your claim you.
should of had him there and then and measured up the road a bit.
we could see how.
you're too late to have ended up knock for knock.
It's as though.
it were partially my blame you know.
They paid half of erm.
totally his fault you know!
But these youngsters today they could kill.
someone they would n't er.
they would n't be compassionate about it you know.
Oh no, I think you got a pretty good case there.
It's nasty though is n't it?
It leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.
Where are you, North Wales, Chester?
I thought, ooh by that.
you know.
Anyway, one lady came came to the house whilst I was here and she said oh it's not quite what I want.
last week getting married.
Put a deposit down will you, oh ca n't.
pick it up till the weekend.
But I'd come down to er, one two five you see in the local paper.
So anyway, it's gone.
As I say, it did n't cost.
me much.
Did n't cost me.
anything to to buy that one.
so er but it's stuck there for er weeks on end, you know.
we've been finished it.
bit of a.
Yeah, but then I suppose.
Where does sh where's her shop?
Oh, in Wallasey again?
I see, yeah.
Oh well I could go there and have a look, anyway one day.
because is she the only one there is she or.
Yeah.
Wah I did n't know that very well.
I knew.
Lorraine because I, you know.
Oh yes, there was another girl, yeah.
Yes.
Trouble is she only wants to buy it off you cheaply you see, for.
Sometimes they sell things for you do n't they?
And charge you for it.
Yeah.
Usually they're pushed for space as well, you see, that could.
be the other thing, you know.
That's right.
She had the Monday market did n't she? like all things, you know, though people do tend to go in and look and then say ooh yes, very nice!
We'll think about it and say ooh oh you have this do n't you?
Ooh yes.
Ooh yes!
And sell it much dearer there obviously so er you know.
Oh no, no!
We bought, we bought stuff ourselves you know, to people and we've spent on it, so.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well you know the erm Handbridge?
Well you.
but I think there's only one shop there, The Pearl Antiques just over the bridge on the right hand side.
anyway.
Oh yes, that's right yes.
Have you got a a row of shops on your left by the pub.
then er er a park on your right and.
then a couple of the shops, and she's about on the corner this.
Just a couple of ladies erm well it's one lady, I think er the lady just helps her.
We've been in a couple of times and I said that I wanted a chaise you see ooh I got this erm one for Victorian one it's very nice, and lovely warm you know, the legs anyway it was one one thousand three hundred you see, so I thought, oh I said well I did n't wan na.
Well that's what you can spend now for a good one.
But this is ready to take home but I said oh, can I have it out?
She said, yes.
Oh yes, yes!
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Oh yes yeah.
I said to her have you got one that's in bits?
But er for three hundred, you know er but er er.
the back was loose!
And I said, and she said oh well she said you know well it's that's how you've got ta take it stripped, for me to take that to get that done up by a restorer you'd have to take all the upholstery off, or quite a bit off.
and then if it'd go up to about one seven she said, and I could n't sell it here she said, I'm not Chester prices I'm just that bit cheaper.
Which, a lovely lady!
But.
I thought, I was surprised to see it was loose, you know.
You've got ta take it home like that.
The joints have gone and this wanted doing but it would of been extortionate she said, you know, to get it done.
and then try and sell it you know, take.
all that into account.
And I've seen chairs like that, I've seen I do n't know whether it's there but a couple of places, bedroom chairs, gorgeous things, you know!
And the backs!
You know, you can do this with the back!
I mean, you do n't like saying to the people.
you know, because.
their faces drop when you.
you're not supposed to say.
You're supposed be glad that it's old and do n't sit in there, you know th but er it's bad, but though is n't it?
Well you know, you turn things out here and you go in you might see that little.
and magnified in your mind are n't they?
That's alright.
I like it.
Top of the class Gwyneth!
Mm.
Might go and ask him about that ammonia.
Well I mean, whatever you say in the well no.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
The only thing, other thing is we've been you know debating about the er stuff to make up the wax which we'll have to go to Morrells by all, and get it sent here.
anybody.
Anyone.
Mansion?
Oh!
I would n't believe it made that much difference do you?
Oh I see!
So you want the old fashioned.
Mansion.
There's only a small amount in it anyway.
Ooh fair enough,.
He's gon na bring some er for us.
So we need because you've got ta have the right stuff.
It's no good messing.
about with the the normal household stuff.
Yeah, I wish now I did n't think, I that I'd ask, he was busy and.
had he got a great big bottle?
It was only forty pence!
You kno, you know I said it's I had the er the recipe.
there, so it's two ounces, so it's a.
But I suppose I should of got a couple of quid of.
but not for all these, you know.
but I think I'll cheat.
So er.
Anyway, we'll see you on Tuesday wo n't we Mike?
All being well.
What for doing your er pigments and that, is it mixing.
those up?
Oh I see.
ah yes, yes, I see now yes!
Hey one thing I was gon na query you on Mike the erm sanding sealer you know you say you must leave that for at least a week?
Oh yeah!
I do n't know, I, I, I took it home.
with me.
No, I took it home, I I was sort of leaving that to you you know, as you say, as you've just mentioned now that, but no, I thought when you first of you said have n't got the time to put these all the layers of on, you know and.
and you you got ta wa.
Yes, I suppose.
Initially you you're doing that then saying right, forget that one, get on with something else and that's there for a week or whatever till that thoroughly hardens and then.
Right, I'll leave that till Tuesday.
So if I bring it again on Tuesday.
in the state that I've you know.
Yes.
Seems quite thick you know.
Do n't forget I'm go, we're going on top of polish here.
It'll you know.
Yes.
Well.
I do n't know what you call it here.
Grey, yes, oh yes!
That's it, yes!
Yeah.
Okay, well see you Tuesday anyway.
Bye!
Bye bye!
from actually Pat, i Romford is it?
What do you say?
West London.
Oh that's right yes!
And then.
I thought so!
Every now and again you slips.
She says free!
Free o'clock!
No, she does n't, no!
But then you lived most of yo.
Oh yes.
By the sea?
Good old.
No!
No, that was bad planning that was!
That's right.
Mm, mm.
And look where you've ended up, this dump!
Oh I think so.
yes!
What about Buckley North Wales, now there's a bit of class up there you know, in those hills!
Not a lot!
Oh it's.
under water now!
Your bungalow!
No!
Terrible!
Yes, that's right..
The old story!
So you have n't got your fierre de tie now?
Or you've.
got another one?
Happy da.
Mm mm.
Oh no!
I could n't drink that now!
No, I, I.
I have done years ago.
That was the Irish way that.
Used to say.
do you want a cup of tea that's been stewing for three days?
Ah, but it's goes too.
dark does n't.
it?
But you must have a go, a fantastic coating on your insides do n't you!

!
He has n't finished yet with his are they on or a finger?
Alright, my old son God bless!
That'll do me now.
In er, in that sense I agree.
I I.
Yeah, it's just this waiting for this sanding sealer you see to dry.
But then you're not spending hours.
putting you know the button on the while you are here.
If you do it the way Bill says.
It's a.
it's a grey area is n't it?
No, I mean.
I mean yo, you do n't get waxing off Bill do you?
Mm.
I think the some of the we've turned out is n't so important is it?
You know, you get something that's only twenty five years old.
it's not so important to get it perfect.
You know, as the stuff he's doing because.
Very good top quality you see so he's got ta have it right.
That stuff.
It's handy to know the right way to do it innit?
And I mean the way he did that table.
It's nice that table anyway!
That old one's gone, you know.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with that.
It's a nice approach I think.
And he makes it interesting.
Whereas Bill.
tends to be a bit I do n't know se dictorial.
does n't he?
This is how it's done get on with it I'm going now!
You know, and then if you ask him again he says, I've told you once!
He's a funny man!
What do you want, a chair?
He's got that huge nice house!
Do want a pouffe?
These Coxes are nice!
One of my.
favourite apples is erm er, a russet.
But the last, really seem to be tiny now and.
I.
Yeah, and just a, as an old old taste about them!
Oh!
Some of them are a bit tasteless I find.
Absolutely no taste at all!
Yeah.
You soon get fed up eating it do n't you?
I am.
Do you want my core Margaret?
It's.
Used to say that in Liverpool!
Can I have your core?
Ooh God!
A And then again have chair, you know, pe, people are reticent of it, they're frightened if it goes.
I'd be hopeless!
I would n't be able to do it, keep up.
with cos.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I notice Joan tapping at the saying, ooh ooh ooh ooh!
Has she?
Oh, did n't know.
What do you mean vell.
For, for September?
Bit early yet is n't it?
Wo n't have the roll and foam.
Well, I would n't of thought.
so they would n't be allowed to join.
would they er.
No.
I'd.
well I suppose they could do could n't they?
And it's not gon na cost anything so the.
I mean Pat started late with us, you know.
She she missed about two months, I think, Pat.
But she soon caught up, you know it did n't make any difference to her but.
The young chap?
Short chap?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's, he's marvellous on the upholstery.
Yeah.
Some people seem to drop in do n't.
they?
Others have a bit of a tough time especially I think with ladies.
they're join, doing joints and that, you know, er I mean, tha tha Sheila, she said oh I'm not interested at all in doing mortars and tenons or.
you know!
But then if you want to do the restoration yo.
Got to!
Of course!
Yeah!
I mean, look at.
look at me or the guys with the sewing machines I mean.
these hands were n't meant for sewi but I mean yo you do get better.
It's surprising!
Mind you she looks a bit tired now, asleep is n't she?
But er well this is no good!
The whistle's gone.
Come on Shirley, I, you're.
usually first up for that!
No you're not.
Again?
They do n't call her part-time Shirley for nothing you know!
Mind you, when she's here it's worth it!
Yes.
Forty!
you said twenty five quid!
Mind you, for that, girl.
it's worth, it's worth it!
Forty pounds, right I'll get a bit of paper.
Good grief!
What a terrible for the wife!
You do n't know, I mean he could of gone if he'd been lying in a chair wa watching the.
telly you just.
do n't know!
I mean at least he was doing something that.
he liked.
But of course, I mean, we know little about it they do say if you have had a heart attack it's no good you know, as soon you get up and you start eating going for five mile walks.
it's got ta be a very.
gradual thing.
But yo you must exercise but.
obviously using a bit of sense.
as well.
Perhaps he's, perhaps him something or.
strained.
God I dunno!
Mm.
He's like me you get well like most.
men they get fed up, that's like.
most women do the same.
It's so constricting!
Yo yo you, you been used to working hard and if they say do n't do this.
I I'd go mad I would, honestly!
But I I er remember Margaret, my wife when she had the er the last one which is a a gap of about ten years between the third you know, and the fourth child.
so of course she had to in hospital so, have this on my pregnancy, you know.
and we'd lost one.
Oh did n't wan na leave home, but anyway she went in and somebody said, oh it'll be about a week you know my fifth one really.
What?
Anyway, this somebody must of given her the idea, I think it was our local doctor oh you'll be alright you know, you have to have to have them in forty eight hours you see so.
she was in this hospita, the, the City Hospital in Chester which is not used now for that.
And er I do do n't know which day it was but she was sitting there fed up second day I'm thinking she said well I, I'm going home tomorrow, so I said no you're staying in for the week!
We.
well that was it then, urgh!
Anyway she was that bad, anyone sa who she saw plus the doctor, you know oh he said, oh no!
So I think they let her out the day after.
The proviso that she.
I had to go there and er I could go back with her in the ambulance.
And then of course, as you say strictly.
no work, well.
You know what women are like, they ha.
they got kids to look after, the first thing you do it's, it is silly really you know but I mean.
For working people, unless you got a maid or something, which you know wha.
Yeah.
Kids do n't understand.
But then again.

That's right!
I was back at work which.
No they have.
Ooh my doctor told me er these guys are n't they, if their wife has a baby.
They used to call them in in in on th, when I was collecting her.
you know, and they'd say the wife ha had a baby.
she'd be doing the work and th.
That the wa, leaving the.

Cos they have the time.
off to look after the.
wife!
Ah, God!
Oh me!
The er the minstrel boy.
You do n't, you do n't wan na hear it!
And I could.
just see the hall and an.
and the lovely voices voices well I say lovely!
And then we wa.
I'll just ask.
No, no this is in Liverpool where I.
mainly brought up in.
you know.
Yeah but erm ooh I can, I can remember that some good old ones.
you know, you do n't.
Oh, and er Lons Road in Weybridgeley when the war started we left Weybridgeley and went to er and then erm Twig Lane was it?
And then, Highton Modern Secondary.
School, the Secondary Modern School.
with co, with co-eds.
you know.
And that was it then till I left but erm.
Tell you what, when the wa, when the war was over we came came to erm Dissert.
when the bomb was about, in Weybridgeley.
you see for, I do n't know, so many months.
My mum could n't stand it in the end she sa let's get back to bomb there!
curtains used to go.
foreigners, yeah!
But er the school, I think it was Rudling I, I've often tried to find it but I I'm not sure which one i, you know, for.
little tots i, that's sa where they were.
Think this an actual churchy-type school.
But they had a.
li, I remember this little room now with a fire going.
you see.
And erm one day a chap came with a donkey in the classroom and it was a, an educated donkey they were and he was what's three and three?
And he'd go once.
What.
what are the, what are these doing?
I said, I do n't know I need to think.
Oh God, it was magic it was!
And I look back on that and you know, nineteen.
forty one, or whatever it was, forty, forty one.
and it was er and then we came to er near er par Prenton.
in the caravan.
mum and dad came to.
stay in this caravan and these posh houses were!
We went there one day and my sister and I, mu, mum was in Liverpool and the sign went sister was elder sister, he was terrified, our John!
And we ran to this house I said.
I said lady can you take.
my sister cos she's frightened of the bombs!
Really!
Where are you from she said?
In that field down there!
God, she must of thought we were gypsies!
Well, she said you'd better come in.
Always remember the be at the door where there was beads curtain, you know as you went through and you've never seen anything like before you know!
Sat there, this cup of tea, terrified!
More terrified than the ruddy planes coming over!
But my mum had to go.
over every week for the groceries you see, had to stick to your own grocer did n't you?
, your ration.
books, and you could n't sort of swop the.
go over.
And mum always used to say that's what gave you that hernia that walking all the way for food!

Oh God!
But I loved it you know!
I loved it!
Perversely!
But, to me.
it was er er er exciting.
And my.
my sister did n't, she was frightened.
you know the.
A couple of years older than me.
but she's a nervous type you know.
They'd go collecting shrapnel in the street, you know and.
Sometimes it was warm!
Oh boy!
If it happened now I'd be I'd be terrified for the kids you know!
So you're.
You.
Birkenhead lady are you?
In what part of Liverpool?
Do you.

Take it out you got, I see, because you.
can pull it too tight I suppose and then er.
it's gon na be right at the front.
Oh I see yes, that's good!
Good!
Good!
Good!
In keeping with a a camber as well, are you, on that?
Is that part of the.
you're taking the camber as well on this.
part are you?
Getting the hold right, yes.
It's a lovely chair though is n't it?
It's worth.
spending a bit of time is n't it?
No, you tend to rush a job like that and then goof you would n't be happy.
Mm, it is yours is it, or.
Oh it's yours!
Lovely!
How much?
Well done!
That's old is n't it?
Oh well, I told you saw one.
at The Cabe i in pa antiques in Chester erm well, it's a nursing chair it wa, it was an armchair.
I forget whether it had wings on it or not.
Er, I do n't even know The Cabe it's quite fancy is n't it, the stuff they've got?
It's lo it is worth a look.
But they had this.
Go no further, I'm going towards Sainsburys.
On the fifty one is it?
The Cristleton Road.
And it's right opposite or near the well, not opposite the Billets it was the auction rooms before.
you get to there.
But they had one in the corner you see and I could see the back leg was gone said to Margaret an said I might as well do something of that, you know, to do up it's the only one that they had there that wanted really wanted repairing, so the feller said ooh I do n't know he said hang on, I'll look in the book.
Victorian walnut.
A hundred and forty.
The state it was in!
I said oh, I said, I'm very sorry but I do n't kno, do n't know what you'd have to charge to justify that you know, to buy it and then do it up, I do n't know!
You'd have to get two hundred and fifty at least, would n't you?
So I thought that was a bit greedy so, that's not bad at all that!
That would go for a lot more in Mold.
Oh yes!
Oh yeah!
Definitely!
Which one do you get it from?
Tell me.
Oh that's the one you're oh!
Monday, is n't it?
The go.
on a Monday?
Oh I see, clearing.
Oh I see!
He is Welsh.
Ah!
Special sale!
Ooh I'll have make a not of that!
I saw erm we saw a campaign chair near Mold week before last it was I asked the guy how much put down on it, you know, he said thirty pounds so I sa, I said I saw it for forty.
Did n't stay!
When you can get choice of them, if they're going for forty over a piece!
Forty five, fifty, something like that.
And all it was, was a tiny thing, like a ruddy camp stool!
And the leg so he said, well half a leg was missing.
So I thought well I'm in with a chance, you know, one's wanted a and this leg repairing so compare it with that no.
comparison really!
Very, very reasonable!
You got a chair that's worth another couple of hundred there so well, not yet.
Get this bit right on the back!
God!
Ah!
Do n't you get critical when you've been here a bit?
John, I've got to get the car on the ramps.
Is there any way to stop those ramps.
shooting away.
I used to get two four by fours from the wall in the house.
No I ca n't do it I have n't got these!
And but they seem to shoot away though.
Carpet on on what?
On the ramps?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh I see!
The car.
It's like double.
Hey!
