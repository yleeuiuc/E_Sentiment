
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But no it, it does n't bother me.
I do n't mind you know on camera, I do n't mind being on video, anything.
Warts and all.
Oh no no.
I know.
I ca n't see Mike and Robin making a cake, can you?
Not, no no no.
Robin necessarily but just temperaments.
Jill.
Were they?
Mm?
Mm.
Oh it would be ready mixed, yes.
Oh it's a tribute to the.
Well that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure.
Mm well I rem.
Oh that revolting.
That was terrible.
I remember Jill though.
I do n't remember the mix but mm I do n't know that, I vaguely remember now, yes but.
Mm.
Was it?
Mm.
Yes I've got a hazy recollection but.
Mm.
Jill'll remember.
But she was a lot younger surely, Jill?
And she'd be a bit.
Younger than them I mean.
Mm mm mm.
Mm.
I do n't Chris.
Mm well that's true of course.
Yeah I know.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
But erm quite frankly I ca n't see myself ever getting given the same sort of circumstances.
Yeah.
No I.
No.
Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not.
Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it though.
Must admit technically.
Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but well done I.
I ca n't agree cos I, that's how I like it.
Oh if it gets really charred I know but.
if it's really charred that's a bit.
Certain degree of grey blackness even but.
Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know.
Remember Ro Robin coming home I do n't believe it, burnt burnt toast from an electric toaster.
I do n't know how he does it.
Mm.
Oh well.
Does n't feel like Sunday does it?
No.
I do n't think, well.
I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.
I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er.
Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have they?
Plastic.
Mm.
Mm.
Flipping ducks on it.
Yeah I know.
I do n't think so somehow.
That was just.
Art nouveau.
Mm.
That's interesting er that erm comment Steve made about the postcard.
And the bird of prey silhouette, you know?
I can.
believe that being rather effective.
What the plastic plastic heron?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
But that silhouette business, that could work you know.
I can see that working.
Birds of prey.
Oh the snake you mean?
Yeah.
Mm I've still to have that proved to me to be honest.
It's a damn great snake.
is n't it?
If you think about it.
Mm, yeah.
Cat did n't bother.
No.
Are you sure?
Waiting.
Mm, yeah.
That's what I mean.
It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think.
No.
One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.
I'd have thought.
Mm.
Mm.
No no.
We'll have to watch that pond though leaves next year.
Well this year of course.
Mm.
Well yes I could be a little bit more erm atten attentive to the damn thing could n't I?
We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but erm not all by any means.
See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh yes please.
But I think mm mm.
It was unnecessary was n't it? oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then.
With the top window.
I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment.
As we did, painting the outside yeah.
No not at all.
I'm gon na hold it while you take the two final screws out.
Yeah.
Cos it's almost impossible to get at it.
What?
You mean the whole frame?
And the opening light?
It wo n't be too bad, will it?
Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left.
There's only one skirting board and the pipe cover.
The casing round the other cupboard.
And that's it I think.
And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I do n't know.
No.
Mm certainly want cleaning up.
I may end up taking them off completely though.
I think that may be easier to do rather than do them in situ, you know?
Oh yeah.
Mm.
What two cakes and put them together, he's?
Mm.
Mm.
I'm trying to remember, did they have any, the kids?
I know they cut some for them but.
No.
Mm.
Well yes.
No.
Er well not to me she did n't.
In the afternoon.
They seem very confident they'll be back in time do n't they?
Yeah.
Pick him up at twenty five to four.
Oh god I know.
You're telling me.
Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's there.
wo n't be many places I'd have thought.
No.
Yeah.
I ca n't get over that screw in the woodwork.
Good god.
I've seen dust before but and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail damn great screw!
They've papered over, I know.
I know.
Mm.
Oh the you mean?
Oh aye.
Mm.
Mm.
No, coming back to the.
I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but.
all those splodges of white are putty.
Mm.
Unfortunately.
Well except to take them out.
Scrape the bits of putty out and put some filler in that will accept stain.
Mm.
But that's a fairly long job though.
Mm.
See it wo n't accept stain anyway with that varnish on.
Well I do n't.
You ca n't burn that off though.
It's dust.
What?
It'd stand out a mile would n't it?
Well perhaps not as obviously.
Well it would still stand out would n't it cos it's a different colour?
Mm.
Not as.
not as obvious perhaps as the white but.
Mm.
Mm.
But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain.
I what it's like when?
Mm.
I may have to use varnish stripper.
Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.
I do n't think it'll burn off.
After all the other fumes I do n't think that'll matter.
After the fumes of the paintwork, I do n't think that'll.
No.
Not as bad as.
No no.
Mm.
Ah well that was a varnish paint.
That was a varnish paint.
Varnish.
No.
It is a stain varnish.
In other words varnish, with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it.
As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with.
relatively clear varnish.
Mm?
Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather, I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have tile there to break it, but not those damn things and they certainly wo n't come off and go back.
Mm.
One two three four five six seven eight, twenty four.
Two dozen.
Mm.
The pack.
I do n't know.
I really do n't know.
Oh it varies, the pack does n't it?
Think it is twenty five actually.
pack anyway.
Yeah.
Does n't really matter all that much.
I'd skim over the plaster anyway.
Mm.
It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.
mm.
Well what have they done anywhere?
Mm.
That's more likely the case.
Mm.
Twenty four.
Twenty four on this front face was n't there?
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes.
As it is now it's bloody awful.
Er no I'll give it a miss right now thankyou.
I'm a bit full from my sandwich.
No I I'll enjoy it more.
later on.
No no.
Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but.
Possibly yes.
Mm.
Mhm.
I meant to ask, oh.
Aha aha.
Pardon?
Right.
Right.
Pardon?
Er oh yes, yes I have actually.
I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then I think.
Well, yes because it is at least dry today.
But erm It's gon na make a hell of a racket sanding down afterwards you know.
No it ca n't be helped, no.
I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper too.
Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but.
I ca n't think that all that much goes through you know, to be honest.
Obviously.
Yeah.
No that's what I mean.
Some of the heavier banging and the, the high pitch high frequency erm noises like me drill and erm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah yeah.
Well exactly what we have been doing.
Oh yeah.
They'd still do, yeah.
Oh rather more noise, yeah.
And the clatter of tea cups.
But then I was meant to mention, ask Rachel if she'd seen the photograph cos Mike did n't know about the two photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.
I do n't know.
I really do n't know.
Well you claim to be able to.
Mm.
Yeah.
What the hell's it called, a what?
Something anemone was n't it?
Oh yes?
Mm will it get it there?
Mm.
Well it looks like the illustration does n't it?
Mm.
Has it yeah.
Has it got the same number of petals on it?
Oh yeah.
Not just the colour and the number of.
Well it's.
I would have thought.
Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because erm I do n't suppose the original plants have been fed for generations, literally.
Yeah.
Well those ramblers and all over the place, mm.
Yeah.
Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser is n't it?
Growmore.
You're the gardening expert.
Yeah that's right, yeah.
Ah!
That was right erm it was the tomato fertiliser was n't it, that was quite good for something?
As well, er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.
Yes, they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes.
But also tomato fertiliser apparently is useful for I do n't know.
Look it up at the end of the book.
Incidentally what's this er operation that Jenny was on about?
Er not Jenny, Josie was on about this morning that er Jenny had?
Oh she had a caesarian did she?
I was forgetting she had a caesarian.
Of course.
Of course, good god yes.
I was thinking it was knit one purl one on the stitches you know, but mm.
Of course, oh yeah.
Oh yes.
Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm it is in England somewhere I think a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound some ounces kid.
Good gracious.
Tremendous size that is is n't it?
Mind its weight, I do n't know about the size but mm.
We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls do n't we?
Over that playing field there.
Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year.
Of course not, that's true.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh yes but I mean they they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason.
blackbird there.
Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the different methods of landing.
Some are quite accurate.
The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think.
Yeah.
caw caw caw That looks like an old one to me does n't it?
Yeah.
Well not an old fella necessarily.
Hang on.
What seems to change?
In what way does it ch?
I'm looking from here.
I'm going along.
Er y oh yes, there in front.
Oh it does there.
See what you mean.
Yes.
Yeah.
it definitely does change does n't it?
Mm.
Yes.
I'm not surprised they're poor.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia are n't you?
Same.
Mm that's why I do n't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly.
Lop it down.
Yes I agree.
Lop it down but erm.
Take its own.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes maybe you're right.
Mm.
Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter, hedge cutter you know?
No there were n't.
Oh new they are certainly yes.
Preferably.
Not essentially.
I do n't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is it? no.
Yeah.
They could be.
Mm.
Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too.
Mm.
Mm.
And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty.
it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out.
Because it's doing more work is n't it?
Mm well in theory.
A bigger area, bigger length.
You're cutting more at the same time.
Good god.
Stone the crows.
Cor.
Good gracious me.
No no.
What?
Chainsaw?
Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned.
Yeah hang on.
Hang on.
In a well established hedge like that.
I would think er the loppers, if the erm hedgecutter wo n't tackle it the loppers will.
Mm.
Er I would n't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there.
That's a little bit too heavy for it.
Well the one where the hedge terminates and.
That dead looking e well dead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer.
Yes.
Yes yes.
Er combination of both I should think.
I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway.
I can use the loppers.
If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough, you'd probably need a chainsaw but anything, the loppers or the handsaw.
No.
No no no no not the really not the thick ones.
But erm.
But you see we do n't really need a chainsaw do we?
No.
No.
No.
To hire one possibly for a specific specific job but.
Not very dear.
What erm chainsaws?
I think last time I looked at the hire list, price, price list.
I think about five six quid a day something like that, they were last year.
Mm.
Oh it is n't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do.
That can be done in a day you know.
Mm.
Now whether that's erm including all the protective clothing or not I dunno.
There might be a different charge for that but.
Oh the twelve quid's worth was n't it?
Was it twelve?
Sixteen.
What is, well yes.
Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip.
And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I do n't know.
Did it say from?
What did it just say?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip.
See I do n't see erm them shifting very much for that because by the time you've got a bloke out paid his wages, paid for the the erm skip shifter, transporter you know.
It might be a trailer.
It might be an open back lorry, you know.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well, you know mm.
But again on a costing basis I mean hourly.
How long is it gon na take a chap to load loads?
Er I had noticed.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I was worn out already.
What are you on about?
I'm knackered.
Mm.
Oh I'm not adverse to having bit of help.
you know of the right sort.
No no no, no no no, no Erm.
A little perhaps but er I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth ca n't you?
Quite honestly.
Spend your time watching.
Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah.
Well more, more or less, yeah.
One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go.
Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees is n't it?
Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more or less straight in the trailer wo n't it?
Oh highly probable.
Sod's law, yes.
What?
Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower?
Mm.
Mm.
I honestly do n't know Nina.
I do n't know.
Oh I w, no I would n't do it today.
No, crikey no.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes.
I'm going to investigate, see if I ca n't do a conv I do n't think for one minute I will but it's possible do a conversion er into erm the box type.
Cos that way all the or most of the cuttings at least, go into the box would n't they?
It's possible.
It might be.
It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner and cutting the erm.
No?
Well i it's not a big thing, it's only you know what I mean do n't you?
That yellow and green one?
No.
It depends which mounting.
Keep the centre of gravity low and there'd be no problems.
Mm.
Maybe not, no.
Mm.
It's quite possible but erm.
Well I'm gon na bash on with the erm.
Well er yes please.
We can do it now then.
Okay.
Right.
And hopefully by teatime I should have got the burning done.
Right, away we go.
What's it called ling.
Mm.
Is this the rather uncovered one then?
To erm.
No.
No that's what I thought yeah.
Mm mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
What, to mix with the soil or?
Oh I see.
Mm.
Prick them out.
Prick them out!
How on earth d'you remember that, prick them out?
Well not really.
Mm dunno.
Not a clue it's.
With being bush things you mean?
What were they like, those ones we had before?
Grew.
Well the ones we grew previously..
Mm.
Well edible wise?
Oh definitely I know that but were they pleasant, unpleasant?
Rather nice or run of the mill or?
Oh that's right.
Oh yes I remember those.
Mhm.
Mm.
What were those go on.
No I do n't frankly, no.
Mm.
Oh that's right.
I remember growing those on the roof of the shelter.
What were those?
Ordinary tomatoes were they?
Mm.
Mm.
Any particular reason, or.
they wo n't do well?
Mm?
Mhm.
Mm.
Change of weather's turned the place into a hive of activity has n't it?
The change in weather, you.
power saw, power drill.
Lawnmowers.
Strimmers.
Mm.
Erm oh yes, yes it does.
That chap's making a good job across the way you know.
Round the corner.
Well he's just rendering the the house.
He's a builder fair enough but nevertheless he's doing a good job.
The erm lives next door to Anna?
Mm.
Last two houses?
Oh yeah.
Mm.
Mm chap round the corner young fella, what maybe in his late twenties perhaps a rather seedy, scruffy looking bloke.
keeps saying hello, I'm not completely sure where he lives.
He seems to know me cos he erm when we've been out and big smile, hello you know?
He may be somebody's father or a kid's father, I do n't know.
Who?
Oh my god I do n't know what erm oh well it was toward the end of the week was n't it?
Yeah.
Was it Thursday?
Oh Wednesday it was going to be.
Wednesday, that's right w weather permitting Wednesday.

Mm.
Mm.
Well apparently they've got to have the loot in tomorrow.
Or by tomorrow anyway.
the boy?
No.
No.
It could well be the meters have been changed to erm twenty P.
Probably have.
I did the lawn twice.
Once one way, cleaned it up and then did it the o opposite way.
With the grass being so long, you know?
Oh it was, yeah.
Mm.
oh this year definitely.
Oh I know it's a combined fertiliser and weed killer.
The only weeds we've got to get rid of really are those erm are they dandelions?
Mm.
And I doubt whether it can get rid of dandelions.
really?
Oh.
Was it we went to?
With your mother I mean.
Hawthorn Cottage or something.
Jasmine House, well Jasmine House.
mm.
Oh did we go oh go on.
Yeah.
Well christ well Mm.
What's on the magic tonight then?
Apart from The Bill that is you know.
Oh my god so it is.
Do you know I could have sw is it Mo is it Monday?
Oh yes of course it is.
Good grief.
Oh well.
Mm.
I suppose that politics will be mentioned.
Oh where do we go?
The village ha oh that place where they had the erm used goods sale?
Mm.
Mm.
That is the village hall, yeah.
Mm.
Oh Mm.
It's logical when you think about it cos being a small community.
you'd be able to cope quite easily there would n't you?
Why disrupt the school and shift stuff.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm?
Mm.
Mm.
Well I'm quite decisive really.
conservative again.
As far as I'm Paddy no but the party.
No no no no.
That's why people wo n't vote er a lot of people wo n't vote for them.
Cos they're considered a wasted vote are n't they?
But erm you're voting for a party not for a character.
Although I do n't know, look at Maggie.
Yeah I mean she for a bit she was the party was n't she?
Old bossy boots herself.
Well she appeared to have done yeah, mm.

That was on the way anyway.
If she had n't done it somebody else would have done.
It's a pendulum business is n't it?
No union, downtrodden workers and so create the unions and swing the pendulum.
Mm.
Well that.
Even some of the strikers.
I mean you've got no choice have you?
If your union came out you were out.
One out, all out.
Oh yes, that's right.
I'd forgotten about that.
Mm.
Mm.
Was really was n't it?
It seemed that Smith has got a better image than the present chancellor has n't he?
Mm.
Pity he could n't, does n't come over better.
He may be quite an able chap.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
Exactly.
Power.
Mm.
Why do people want to be on the stage?
Why do people want to be vicars and things?
In the public eye.
Erm.
No no no.
Something to do with growing things?
No no no.
It was something to do with growing things.
That sort of came over quite strongly.
Was it?
Are you sure?
Oh.
No I growing things.
Still I do n't suppose he'll be.
Kids very seldom are are they?
Oh Major I bet he wanted to be right from being a kid, wanted to be prime minister.
Very?
Oh extremely yeah.
Like his father.
No.
Steve does n't.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Oh crikey yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh he's a very bright little boy but.
You ca n't really relax with him can you?
He's switched on.
Mm and they should n't be ca n't, rather it ca n't be down to lack of contact I would n't have thought.
In part I suppose it's due to erm complete contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our way.
Could be.
She was just like an automated programmed doll, oh god.
Poor kids ca n't help it of course but.
Oh she's a nice little kid, yeah.
Pathetic really to see her wa waving like that.
Aah!
Mm.
Oh well.
She may change quite a lot, on the surface anyway.
Oh indeed yes.
Yes.
Certainly has.
Mm.
I mean it's most unnatural for a child not to be chatting away in the presence of grandparents is n't it?
Unless the grandparents are a couple of weirdies.
Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird anyway.
Could be right.
Could be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not a bad evening now is it?
No.
very brief this morning I think.
We were due for better weather today which we've had.
And then I think more rain tonight.
But as the girl in the post office said erm it's usually different here than the weather forecast which is probably is, the gulf stream.
It's not too bad finding where you want to go.
when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or whatever it is but finding your way out.
Very seldom they have continuing er continuity of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out.
Mm.
Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah exactly.
Mm.
I mean once you've got in.
But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead.
It's like a labyrinth you know.
Mm.
Mm.
Exactly.
I asked somebody the way out and she offered to show me.
Mm.
Oh yeah, cleaner, mm.
Mm?
Yes I remember you saying.
Oh it would be of course, yeah.
Mm oh it would be.
It's quite a, it seems at least quite a pleasant hospital.
Quite a pleasant atmosphere.
Mm.
oh no, they wo n't of course.
Oh no.
What?
Well they're often having intruders, go on.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh that's right I remember.
Yes yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And di did n't she have to leave?
Did n't she ha well, to get from A to B did n't she have to leave the building somewhere?
Yeah I thought so.
Mm.
They're not too bad here but at Witham Withamshaw it'd be a different kettle of fish altogether.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm hang on.
I remember going late at night.
Were we collecting her?
Were we really?
Mm.
I remember that happening but.
And that was Withamshaw?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
You said.
Oh yes, that's right.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes, that's right.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, you get so used to having a phone at home do n't you?
Not too bad here from what I've seen.
No.
Oh well!
It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working.
Mm.
Were you?
Jolly good.
W tomorrow is it they go?
Mm go on.
She probably.
Was it Carol?
No it's not Carol.
I do n't know what her name is but I know the one you mean.
The travel agency girl?
Young woman, yeah.
Probably.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm wondering what made them change their mind over the er knock through into the garage.
Oh I'm not sugge.
I know.
Mm.
Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that I mean even with the mortgage.
No.
Before they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff to clear it.
I do n't know.
I really do n't know.
They were due to get one.
Any time.
Possibly.
Oh possibly again i it's just possible actually that the construction of the bungalow did n't lend itself properly well to knocking through.
Well.
Labour.

Well mm.
Oh yeah I know.
But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next, are n't they?
Mm.
Oh!
Fair do, I know but er it's up to them what they do with their money I know but mm.
Well which paper?
I have n't the faintest idea.
One sheet?
Oh.
I do n't know.
I have n't the faintest idea.
I have n't moved it at all.
Not knowingly anyway.
No.
It's possible I've used it but I do n't erm do n't recall.
Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know this afternoon when I emptied the bag.
And that was.
Yeah I know.
Yes.
Yes for the er.
the two bungalows yeah.
Mm.
It is incidentally.
It's where I thought it was.
On the left hand side and erm it's pretty near the main road.
Oh you do?
The area.
It is on the main road.
I do n't know Nina.
I have n't the faintest idea.
I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know.
But.
Probably.
There's not much of a difference between.
No.
Mm, yeah yeah.
fairly tight.
Sorry, go on.
Oh yeah.
Where Whereabouts was that?
Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean?
Sorry, yeah.
Well did Carolyn say that?
I ca n't remember.
Well Dawn thought it was.
I certainly thought it was.
But then.
I do n't like traffic noise.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh crikey, no.
Oh no.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Certainly not at night you wo n't get a lot, no.
Erm.
Yes but it's noises you do n't notice, if they're continuous then they become.
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean that's one of the beauties here was n't it?
It's so peaceful, so quiet.
There's no noises to get used to really.
Apart from the birds and the bees and the.
sycamore trees.
And Sambo flying around yeah.
No he just crawled under the door sort of glare, glare at me and then scootled, shooted past, you know.
Shot I should say.
Shooted past.
He shooted past as well as shot past.
Mm.
I do n't know because he he's never really been frightfully keen on me, that cat.
I doubt that very much indeed.
Get on.
No.
No.
No I try to him but you know but er.
He's alright.
He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er he's pretty wary for some reason.
It may well be of course that father was a bit er all dog and no cat sort of person, you know?
I dunno.
Oh yes.
No argument about that, yes.
Good nick.
and well fed and.
Mm.
Hang on.
Oh there, yes.
Yeah.
Well we wo n't be needing so many that's for sure, no.
I want some for the erection at the side of the pool there.
To take the waterfall.
Mm.
It's only got ta match the existing er.
Not bricks as such, no.
Cut some of the paving stones.
to roughly brick size.
and use that.
As I have done with that erm.
collection Pardon?
Not no no no no no.
Not an awful lot, no.
I can pad out with sto with er brick where it does n't show.
It'd look a bit odd with bricks though, I think.
Oh yeah.
And then we want matching slabs really do n't we?
Mm.
Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when they've er.
when they've abandoned the graveyard.
Yeah.
Yes, they made it so it could be.
Yes.
Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement, I do n't know.
To, to cope with that though.
Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and there are.
probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.
Mm.
I seem to remember papers about that.
Erm that removal or disposal or alteration of the any creation around the grave was erm can be done at the discretion of, of the.
parks authority or whatever it is, yeah.
Parks and cemeteries, yeah.
Oh yes.
Both in far more pleasant to the eye.
far neater and er oh yeah.
They can get more bodies in too.
No I ha!
No I just had a thought because there must be stacks of old grave gravestones around.
Some of the marble they cracking cracking bit of, yeah I know.
Should be for the price they charge too.
Ridiculous forking out a fortune.
Yes you've got, yeah.
Yeah that's a point.
That's a point.
I think they're rather thicker than that, the damaged gravestone.
Mm.
When you think of all the.
Go on.
Oh.
I would n't say indestructible, but I know what you mean, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah very very longlasting, yeah.
Depends on the quality of the marble too does n't it?
Obviously.
No I was gon na say, when you think of all the money that's spent with these very elaborate er headstones erm creations showing angels looking down on them, plonking at their harps and god knows what.
They look quite nice from one point of view but er fifty seventy eighty hundred years later what the hell does it matter?
You know?
Well if we get some headstones it'll be different.
Cor.
Er yes.
The mantelpiece?
Yeah.
That one is I'm pretty sure, yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh no that will.
No.
No no, it's not original that.
No.
You can see where the original fire surround was.
Look at the plaster work there behind it, above it.
Mm.
And where's the hearth different hearth is n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No I should imagine it's a typical sixties, late sixties erm well early sixties er tile surround, you know?
It's not.
Go on.
Erm.
And our bedroom.
There's in there, no.
Not, no.
Yes.
Lick over.
Oh yes.
Yes it's good enough there.
There's between the two yeah yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
. Mm.
For wallpaper removal?
Oh yes.
I need to see how those steamers work, how well they work.
Mm.
Yes and Derek remember, next door?
And Terry, he said.
He had n't used one before, and he was a bit cackhanded.
So they must have been pretty good.
Mm.
Nice just to.
Mm.
You mean it was working so quick and easy?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Do you remember the old days when it was standard practice to put one paper on top of another?
With the overlap.
You know?
Oh god I do n't know.
Yes.
Yes it probably was.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
But do you remember the borders?
The edges I should say at the, at the roll?
They used to have little marks to line the paper up when you hang it.
Yeah.
Down the.
Exactly.
Down the edge.
the name of the manufacturer and possibly the say the model like the that particular paper's erm category name.
But it had at about oh eighteen inch intervals, something like that?
Little marks, sometimes an arrow sticking out.
When you, when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow.
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Yeah but do n't you remember when they had that erm erm semi-perforated edge on it?
And you knocked it on the edge of a table?
Mm.
Yes.
I do n't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place.
Unless it was, in those days, they did n't have the shrink wrap stuff did they?
Oh did n't th I was just thinking yeah.
Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job that, yeah.
Oh yes of course.
Oh god.
Well this particular paper, you you've got to be very care.
otherwise it crushes very easily.
Mm.
No.
It's not my favourite by any means.
What?
Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.
Not a lot, no.
I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the wall.
Erm.
and there's also there's a usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door.
yeah.
It's worth doing.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes.
And there's all the burning off and mm.
And also I want to, while the carpet's up, investigate the run of the cable.
So it's.
About?
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's a spur coming off that runs into the er But I do n't think it's a proper imme immersion heater circuit.
Well it does n't have to be.
No it does n't have to be.
No no no.
No.
No.
Er yes.
Yes.
That would be erm the junction box.
Mm.
To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater.
Mm.
Mm.
Because y you, when you have your cable up to the junction, hang on up to your junction box.
and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself.
you have erm a heatproof cable called er systaflex I think it's called.
Yeah.
Er it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes over.
Heat resistant.
So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the.
Hang on.
There are a lot of pipes.
Erm.
do you mean the one with the pump in?
Oh that pipe.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh.
Erm.
offhand I ca n't say yes I do but.
Flat and then it comes down.
Oh you you mean in the room?
Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no.
Oh it's in the oh sorry, go on.
Carry on.
If there's a pipe or pipes cupboard yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes I know, yeah.
Yes.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh it's not just for the radiator.
It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.
That's right, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Well again that's not original is it?
The central heating system is er a later addition to the house is n't it?
And those pipes were where the circs where the, the where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen.
And to the bathroom.
Mm.
And quite probably the cold water supply to the bathroom too.
Mm.
And I think not the kitchen, that's on the rising main.
Cos your stop tap is underneath the er.
sink top there.
. But that one there is er fed, I'm pretty sure from the, yes it is.
Yeah because the pipe goes up there.
Mm.
And, if you think about it, there's a header tank in the loft.
the cold water from somewhere.
So it'll come from there across the ceiling.
across the ceiling up through the erm cupboard.
into the l into the loft and.
Mm.
So you'll have the hot water pipe to supply the hot tap.
taps.
And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in the loft.
Yes they certainly could.
But at the time of building I think it was just continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on the top.
Mm.
Pretty sure.
There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but above that housing, that cover.
on the bathroom wall.
the wall separating the bathroom from the spare room.
from the back bedroom in the bottom there's been a hole about the size of a pipe.
about three quarter pipe, yeah.
Or fifteen mil twenty two millimetres yeah.
Mm.
What a good.
time we had a wash up and a cup of tea I think.
It's two and a half minutes to six o'clock.
Or eighteen hundred.
Oh the news.
Let's see if the queen's dead.
Where's the new oh is that the news?
See if the queen's dead.
Oh yes I noticed yeah.
Well.
Oh I would n't know any of them.
Mm.
Is it based on the contents of of rather the erm.
people on the box?
Oh crikey, I w definitely would n't know.
I definitely would n't know, no.
up my nose it's erm quite erm.
Not a bun but a cake.
Right.
Well what time do I remind you?
Half past six?
Yeah.
Well it's quarter past six now.
Mm.
Mm.
Well it would n't take me that long.
Quite a bit more today anyway.
Mm.
There's a lot of work.
But we, we're getting there slowly.
Mm.
you see the doors are different, quarter inch difference in size.
No it did n't surprise me cos they usually no, they put the casing up, the door casing.
And then the chippie erm cuts the door to fit.
it, you know?
Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you.
just it in.
Fortunately it is the right way round.
Well it is more or less.
No.
No.
They possibly are today.
Erm a lot of stuff's factory er.
On the building site, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
What?
Oh she said a few days ago about some bungalow or something he's he's helping to build.
He, he's a brickie is n't he?
Yes that's right.
Mm.
Mm.
I have n't the faintest idea.
Not the faintest.
yeah.
I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job.
Of any sort.
Never mind just in the building trade.
Well he's got all his mates.
And he er I do n't think he's got the confidence to.
No.
Mm.
See I did see there's that place erm erm oh it's going, it's Tearscross direction.
Erm.
they advert.
Well, they advertise in the paper every week.
Advertise carpenters and joiners.
But.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well he.
See hang on no no no.
The job's been never finished never will be finished with the corporation on it.
It's amazing.
Specially there.
Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Oh to be fair to him, yes he has.
He's been very quick at that.
No, precisely.
No.
No.
I would have thought so.
Yes.
I would have thought so.
No.
Oh he'd never do it.
It's ridiculous.
Ah.
Yeah, ca n't.
It probably was Swansea area.
I think it was, yeah.
Go on.
Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina.
That was motorway nearly all the way.
And he could do it in less time.
It was a straight run.
There was no driving involved.
You just point the car in the right direction press the pedal and you're there.
It's a longish way but erm for Ken it's not quite the same as erm the A roads and B roads and.
oh no.
Cos he does n't really like driving.
No.
He'd never do Mike's job.
Well he'd never do Mike's job anyway but.
you know, the driving side.
Mm.
He's got a big area to cover, Mike if you think about it.
Seems to yes.
Mark you he would n't crack on if he did n't.
No he would n't say very much about.
No.
No.
Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves?
Mm.
Oh a hi fi firm.
Oh no.
He'd sooner be out.
I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes.
Mm.
Oh yes.
Well.
Go on.
Well you usually mm.
Er no I d particularly in view of her experience.
I do n't think she would.
Quite as much anyway.
She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on, yes.
And possibilities for Carolyn.
came now.
I do n't we may be completely wrong.
But as far as this exchange business is concerned.
You'd never get erm you'd never get an exchange.
I do n't think we operate that scheme now.
No.
No, no.
It's er moderately interesting so far, yes.
No I thought you might.
That's one, another reason I got it out from the library.
Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.
About all the er astonishment, amazement the English press and public and the Swedish press and the public and the American press and public, you know?
Push push push all the time.
Erm.
Yes well of course you can only assume that what he says is correct.
He's quoting various er authorities on the subject.
I've only just started the damn thing really.
Well he that's why he wanders on a bit.
Erm keeps giving little bits erm It was when he was a child apparently, he claims to have been aware of it, you know?
Mm.
Mm.
Oh that I do n't know.
Mm.
He admits to wanting to be a showman, you know?
A film star and god knows what.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
You certainly shoot through the first few ch chapters of that anyway.
Oh yes.
Lot of repetition.
In effect.
Politics.
Is this based on TV then or?
Oh well.
It's probably their own quiz game then is it?
Or panel game or.
Mm?
Oh.
I ca n't think of any TV quizzes or panel games or.
You do n't think it is?
And you have n't got any of the letters?
Oh.
Oh, I would n't know.
Oh English, I do know.
Oddly enough.
Arthur English.
Oh yes, yes.
Well not really, no.
It's just that I happened to.
Mm.
Good grief.
and all that jazz.
Mm.
Oh.
H E Bates.
I think so.
Steer away from bloody television and we might still have a fighting chance.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
I have n't the faintest idea.
Oh I'm certain it is.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Still think something, probably it's about something but probably tied in with the er erm.
Hang on.
The first letter is A?
Oh it's not the South Bank Show then.
Erm A something E something?
Mm.
Depends how desperate the need is.
Yes thank you.
puddings.
Well let's face it Mm.
The broom.
Erm.
Oh for the back?
Yes.
Probably.
Where else could we go?
Other than that er rather expensive.
It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions.
Mhm.
To me that Dingle place.
I was n't at all struck, no.
There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling.
Yes, messy.
And it was n't just the messiness, I do n't mind that, but.
They were n't looked after.
Mm.
No.
Yeah.
Where did we get that?
Did we?
Mm.
Oh yes.
With most of the plants it does, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Well obviously, yeah.
For the for the contrast, yeah.
Mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm.
It should look quite attractive.
It might be a bit of a job erm keeping them separate.
growing into one another.
No?
Oh.
Oh that's alright then.
Good.
Yeah, but they do grow out a bit too.
I mean the one at twenty seven.
No no.
No no no no.
Mm I suppose so, yeah.
Mm.
Gardener's World?
I have n't really looked at it, no.
I glanced very briefly at it but.
No I did n't see that.
Some er excellent photography there you know.
Mark you, most of.
There's a what?
I've no idea.
Saturday or Sunday?
Erm the left or the right?
Do you mean where the daffs are going?
Yes.
Oh yes.
Oh there you mean, not at the bottom, at the side.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah?
Have n't we got some towards this end?
Perhaps.
Oh I see.
Mm.
If it's an evergreen, no it's not is it?
Mm.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Survived.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yes.
Course they will, yeah.
Mm.
Pardon?
Cutting the hedge?
Oh yeah.
But how often do you have to cut that sort of hedge then?
Not like a privet.
Mm.
No?
Er all I can remember a lot of plants coming.
But I ca n't remember.
Oh yes she did, a label mhm.
Mm.
I do n't know.
Oh I see.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Ah!
Well, good o.
Well.
Mm.
I've come across a bit of architrave by the way.
Quite apart from.

Erm.
So I can use that as an experimental piece.
, there's stuff come to think of it it's the one in the hall.
The doorway that's bricked up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
the architrave from there.
Erm it's exactly the same varnish stain as this.
So I can muck about on that piece before I tackle it in here, so mm.
stripping goes.
Without staining, without what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
First of all what's the best stripping medium.
Whether it's gon na be gentle heat, whether it's gon na be varnish stripper?
Paint stripper?
What the hell.
And then see the go on.
If we want to change the colour.
Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such.
But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy, that stuff I always think.
Mm.
See look at.
Pardon?
Well it's only what erm the architrave the arch there this side, that side and that one there.
Well as I say you ca n't stain varnished wood Nina.
You can put a varnish stain on.
Varnish stain but erm In in this particular light now I can see where they've put on thick blodges that run down.
Mm.
Oh what was?
I do n't think.
Oh no I do n't think, I do n't think it's from square one.
It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish.
Should n't think, no.
I doubt it very much indeed.
Yes it is.
And do you know the old bog door, it's the same colour as next door's.
Or was I should say.
The same yucky blue, yeah.
Mm.
So if you look at the next time you're in the loo.
where the handle was, look where the blue shows.
And that's that was the original colour.
Yeah.
The original colour, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
It might of course have been a more acceptable blue when it was put on because it changes.
Oh goodness.
Oh down here?
Where?
Oh Prestwych.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Paid a fortune for the damn.
Yeah.
No.
I only remember one.
Yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Was it really?
Well how do you mean?
The paintwork was blue?
What?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.

Well it's is n't it?
Blue for depression and red for excitement and.
What's a calming colour?
No, no.
Well it's a change from black that.
They've got the furniture of course, yes.
That's true.
Mm.
Mm.
Well it'll die the death eventually wo n't it?
I mean the stripped pine really horrible.
Is n't it?
Course it's overdone.
It's blooming cheap half of it.
It is cheap.
Er no it is n't cheap.
God no.
Cheaper than.
No, it's not.
. It's usually crummy wood.
Badly assembled.
Well I mean the one that er that er thing, what is it?
It's it's rubbish, that thing.
It's rubbish.
Absolute rubbish.
It really is cos.
they moved it out when we went on one occasion cos was the carpet wet or something?
I do n't know.
They moved it out for something reason so I had occasion to look at it more closely.
I thought, I was looking at it before, I thought mm.
Anyway it drew my attention to it and I thought god god.
Mm it might be fashionable but phoo Incidentally I was n't far out with th the age of our friend across the road was I?
Twenty four.
I thought he was about that.
Mm.
Bit like Eric's place in a way.
Mm well no.
Not in that se pardon?
Eric?
I do n't know I wonder.
Oh probably, yeah.
Floating with his beer every afternoon, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Most probably he got waffling on in the Royal Oak and that.
Gave the impression I think.
Mm.
I ca n't see our friend er what was his name?
The chap that bought our house?
The probation officer anyway.

Erm I ca n't see him him getting very chummy with Eric can you?
No.
No.
Well he'd try, initially.
He did try.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
He's a soft touch for everybody else.
Mm.
Mm.
He always meant very well though, Eric, in a lot of ways.
He could n't help being a simple soul could he?
Simple soul..
Mm.
He used to swear blind he saw his mother standing at the end of the bed.
Yeah.
He'd seen his mother sat at the end of the bed ages after she was dead, you know.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
I know yes.
Oh yes.
No I do n't think so.
I do n't know I'm sure but he never mentioned it anyway.
I've got a very hazy, but I could be confusing it her with one of the other relatives.
Was she short, dumpy podgy sort of thing and?
Oh I, neither do I.
Auntie.
Yeah.
So it could have been his auntie, his mother I do n't know.
I wonder if John and John and er mm.
Liz have moved yet.
Oh yes, I vaguely remember that but I, whether they'd actually moved or not I do n't know.
Mm.
Which stool?
Oh the tall stool Robin made?
Yes yes.
actually.
I do n't know!
It was a state of chaos then though was n't it?
Oh god no.
Never again.
Well if we do we'll wait another sixty years anyway.
Mm.
Mm.
Well.
it depends on a lot of factors really does n't it?
Or a lot of factors come into it.
Age group finances.
desire to move for a variety of reasons, erm permanently regarded house in the first place, you know?
Yes, that always struck me as a bit odd, yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
That and the obvious school problem too with the kids, yeah.
No it ca n't be.
Well I do n't know about that, I mean with some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away from it.
And some areas, in fact.
I mean really desirable to move away from there was n't it?
Mm.
And privately it would be no bad thing to move away from where they are now.
I mean, well they're gon na have problems wherever they go, but the on erm a different estate different type of estate, they would n't have as many problems would they?
I do n't think so.
Not as many.
No another idea?
What is it this time?
No, no?
Oh I, yes.
Do n't you remember erm.
somebody on Gardener's Question Time answering that?
Well either did I but.
Yes.
For obvious reasons, yeah.
Yes.
Mm.
How much er?
lions obviously, well.


Good god!
Mm.

Mm.
Mm.
Open container with care.
And stand back.
No it would, it would n't necessarily pong.
Mm mm mm.
You can take it two ways, it'll probably get up and bite you.
Was it broom?
Oh yes, yes.
The name of that particular species is in there though.
What do you want?
The colour or something?
Well er wo n't it be in the other one, catalogue.
I seem to remember looking at it in the other one.
Oh yes, your free giftie.
Oh yes.
It'll arrive no doubt.
Not for that sort of er thing, no.
They're certainly not quick.
And they probably have n't if they get five hundred certain number and five hundred thousand you know?
It's not worth looking on the box for the news because it's, they'll be nothing new.
Mm.
Mm no doubt you will eventually.
these?
What on earth is a rolled house?
Oh no no.
Yeah.
Well it's a bit like these victorian wheelbarrows and things are n't they?
Yeah solid.
How much were they?
About seventy five quid or something stupid like that.
They're not as good as the.
Lot of weight in themself.
Bound to go rotten eventually.
Mm.
Well they're trendy so I suppose it's the usual afternoon run to Leo's is it?
Usual afternoon run to Leo's?
Yeah I suppose we want Mm.
Am I not supposed to be going somewhere tomorrow to to enquire about something or?
Ah.
Oh.
Oh yes.
The estate agents?
Mm.
Yes I think their office is near the erm near Iceland.
Think that's it.
Yeah.
You can have a look.
Yeah.
We always do though.
Do n't we?
Oh yeah.
Well I'm not t is the address there?

I think it's on High Street.
They do n't sh give the address?
Oh good god.
Oh.
Ah.
Yes by the number I er it is, I'm pretty sure where I thought.
Going in to, or rather going up High Street in to High Street from the erm Freemans Way, you know?
It's this side of Iceland on the right.
Mm.
Yeah.
There's no there's no price on there I presume?
Ooh!
Well it's possibly at the request of the vendor you know.
Oh yeah I know.
Course you will.
Oh no no no.
Course you will.
Mm.
Oh I wo n't bother with that cos that'll be too expensive, or whatever, yeah.
Oh quite, mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Or possibly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where are those two?
Are those.
Oh, St Peter's Road one is it?
Yeah.
Are you sure that is n't I think they were agents as well for one round the corner.
In Cromwell Mm.
Mm.
Can I have a look?
Okay.
Yeah.
No, that's not the er unless it's another handling agent cos that's not the photograph.
No of, no .Oh I do n't know.
I do n't know.
Well misconstruction about the use of a room more likely but where's me other windows?
Ca n't see with these damn things.
Most attractive detached bungalow blah blah blah blah blah Come to think of it I do n't think it is that one.
I do n't think that's the one on St Peters.
No.
Mm.
Yeah.
It did.
It's, it's not in this week then, that one?
Mm.
Yeah that's possible.
Ouch!
This other one in Johnston will be fairly pricey I think.
This white one.
Mm.
Eighteen foot lounge job.
Fitted kitchen, dining room.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm.
I ca n't visualize them to be honest, no.
No.
Oh, one or two of them were they?
I can remember one quite clearly that absolutely dog rotten window frames.
Cottage?
Oh.
Mm vaguely.
Is that the one that's going up er but the auction.
Thirteen was it, she said?
Or sixteen?
I'm sure it was thirteen actually, yeah.
It may have been, it may have been sixteen.
Mm.
It ca n't be much for sixteen.
Coo not today.
No.
It may be of course it's on, on auction because they ca n't get a mortgage on it.
It may be too bad for a mortgage.
It could be.
Mm.
Down here you mean?
Oh.
Ah.
North Wales?
Yes.
Oh yeah.
Yes I do.
Yes.
Oh buying unseen you mean?
Oh!
I know.
I could n't.
You just have to be a fool.
That people could buy a property unseen, well you know, it's ridiculous.
And the price.
I mean just when you think about it they they were actually following estate agents when they went out to value a property.
Gee, god.
But now I mean what a difference.
Mm.
I find it a bit hard to believe what said about being the boom's coming ba not boom but picking up.
I do n't.
I do n't know.
Well.
mm very.
Mm.
Sorry, no.
Even if.
At least let them know you're not going.
For one reason or another, yeah.
Mm.
No no.
Never forget that girl in that bungalow we saw.
Was it the one?
With the.
With the yellow radiator.
That's right.
She and dog muck all down.
But I could n't help but feel sorry for her.
She was quite a young girl was n't she?
Oh yes.
Yes.
Mm.
She knew damn well we were n't interested did n't she?
She must have done.
She was sort of half apologetic.
Mm.
I presume she must have done eventually.
Mm.
Er and a husband was a teacher er a lecturer.
was n't he?
And that one we saw.
You walked in the front door and you quickly walked out the back door.
Oh strewth.
Well exactly, yeah.
Mm.
Still.
I suppose we might have had one or two lucky escapes there did n't we?
By not buying up there.
Well I certainly would n't, but I know somebody else was getting a bit fed up but.
Quite a few.
We certainly travelled around did n't we?
Yeah when I think that's mm.
We clocked some miles up.
Not bad.
Not bad, no.
Not compared with down here I do n't think.
No.
It still had a north of England feel about it you know.
Did n't it?
Mm.
It was a big improvement on Manchester, fair enough, but er mm.
I can accept, of course.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh the properties themselves.
oh yes, indeed, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
The comical thing is one of the comical things is there's quite a lot of money go into some of those corporation houses you know?
I know.
Yeah what about the income going into the house?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
No they do n't need a big place.
No.
Ooh with all the space heating, carpeting, decorating.
furnishing.
Well.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
It's jumping about I know but I wish we could hear from Robin.
It'd be nice would n't it?
Yeah photograph or something.
Mm.
Hang on.
Which Ken?
Big Ken?
Oh well li.
Oh yes yes.
Er when is his birthday?
Is it really?
Oh.
And how old will he be?
Poor old codger.
Is he as old as that?
Good grief.
Well I do n't think anybody does.
I mean.
Remember Percy across the road?
Not wanting anybody to know he's seventy four,.
Well exactly.
I was quite surprised.
For a farmer too, ex farmer I should say, yeah.
Mm.
By god he's got some stuff.
Ooh.
Oh I ca n't forget Alec.
Go on.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, Mm.
Did he?
Mm.
Yeah he looked older than he w he looked older than he was, yeah.
Never guess how old I am.
I do n't know you, no no.
Mm.
graceful if you tried to really, yeah.
Mm.
bloody handlebars on his bike.
It's handlebars up his sleeves is n't it?
He said I do n't know.

I do not know.
Mm.
Oh well.
He was a sitting target for Mike though was n't he?
Oh strewth!
Mm.
G er go on.
She probably is.
Erm.
Not in her later years, certainly not, no.

Mm.
Oh!
Really?
Oh well, mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes.

Mm.
Mm.
Y yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
damn paint and stuff, cor strewth.
Ooh.
Oh I'm doing it outside tomorrow definitely.
Oh weather permitting.
There's a lot there's a lot more paint left to burn.
Good grief.
It's a worthwhile job though, is n't it?
Mm.
Unfortunately it's.
See that back door, had it been applied well, the paint I would have just rubbed it down.
If it had been like our door, the existing door it would have stood rubbing down flatting down and er then.
No, bloody likely, oh no.
too much to repair it.
Yes, it's a thought that.
I wonder.
Well where it's been hacked about.
I'll see if those handles will fill that hacking about.
They might.
Well that I would have to fill of course, obviously but.
that's not too ba oh no no no.
Pardon?
Mm the rest of the door is n't too bad is it?
Okay.
Hm.
Mm.
I'll have a look tomorrow.
No the leading edge I can fill in alright.
To save the.
Variety of things.
Finish off with timber.
I could erm and save the lock er well the yeah the lock.
Mm.
Mm.
It might.
I dunno.
It may have gone too far, they may have bashed away too much.
We'll see.
Which other side?
Hang on.
No how do you mean the other side?
Oh well I've got to do something with that anyway.
Have n't I?
N no, no no.
Cut the bad stuff out and er put the new timber in and shape it to fit the existing door casing, architrave and.
It wo n't scream anyway.
I mean short of replacing the whole door casing which I'm not going to do yeah.
Yes.
Hm.
I'd forgotten Josie saying it was er you know it was a wardrobe.
Made the wardrobe, ha!
No according to Josie it was.
Cos erm I think she or was it Yvonne said to me perhaps I'll find me hillbilly lend me er yeah.
Or perhaps.
Something like that anyway.
All the rough, rough sods in oh strewth.
Terrible.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Mm.
Mm.
And that's when you're being careful.

Mm.
Incidentally what er arrangements er if any, have Mike and have Mike and Dawn made for this er summer?
Well was n't Dawn saying about they're going to go to France this year or something?
Well this is.
When they were here I think.
Oh of course, yes.
Obviously Mm.
Mike has to inform the company obviously if he's taking the car out of the country, you know.

Preferably three but not essentially.
Two er one, if it's a two bedroom they're into the caravan outside.
For the spare bedroom, usual thing.

Where the hell's that?
Yes we do, yes.

Should have come here what.
Yes, I accept that.
Yes.
Y you're absolutely right there.
You really are.
Yes.
Mm.
How many think of the credit column.
Precisely.
Well our milkman, to be honest with you, it got to the stage where he would n't collect milk at night to collect the cash at night.
No.
In.
Stretford.
Mollyrange Stretford, Mollyrange er.
I, I can remember Mollyrange sixty years ago and it was a very very different place, between you and me it really was.
Mosside was n't too bad sixty years ago but now, good gracious.
Oh no!
Oh the wife and I went around Mosside the day after the riots there and, do you remember the riots?
Perhaps you do n't.
In the coloured area.
They were smashing shops and burning cars and what.
You could feel the atmosphere when you were sat in the car.
Disturbing.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Range Warehouse.
Mm.
Mm.
Very good.
value for money, yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I know.
Yes.
Yeah, and yet mm.

Yeah.
Yes I can believe it, yes.
Yeah yeah.
Well the the really?
There's a friend of my wife and I she's, what age is she now?
Well at the time she was in her very late thirties, schoolteacher.
And she bought a house in Mollyrange.
I did n't know about it, I did n't even know she was looking for one then.
Er we saw her one day she said oh I've got the keys by the way.
I said oh, keys for where?
You know.
Oh I've got a house in.
I said oh, whereabouts?
One side of the road there were three brothels and on the other side there were four.
She was a schoolteacher.
She'd no idea, very innocent, very er church, you know?
Oh yes, father was a parson and.
she lasted there about six months, that was all.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
Oh it's very patchy.
But it's interesting, Mollyrange, if you draw a line down the centre Pakistanis on that side and Jamaicans on that side.
Seriously.
Seriously.
Well we've wanted to move for twenty five years possibly.
But you know how it is, it's family ties and kids growing up and then they grow up and have families of their own, then you get tied to the ch grandchildren or what have you.
I've been pushing for a long time but erm down here?
Well I have a brother-in-law living in Stainton He's lived there, he retired there some what, ooh fifteen years ago, more than that.
He'd been pressing me to come down here for a long time.
When I used to bring my wife.
drive down drop her off at in-laws.
Cup of tea, turn the car round and go back.
I could n't stand the bloke at the time.
An ex Manchester lion board of directors, very very full of himself.
He'd been used to having chars and minions running round him.
Took him a while now he's a very nice chap.
But now yeah it took him a while to calm down but he's a very nice fellow now, very nice chap.
And erm we searched over north Wales first of all but phew no thank you.
Extension really of Manchester in a way, north Wales.
Mm.
Then we er got a letter from ah my daughters, one of my daughters one of my many daughters married to a coastguard in Milford.
Erm she spotted a house in the paper, sent it up.
I said oh come on, we might as well go down and have a look.
And we went down, liked it and that was it.
Mm.
And regretted that we had n't come before.
Oh seriously.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Thank you very much my love.
Oh indeed yes, that's right.
Well I'll concern it with my daughter first of all naturally.
Cos I d I hate wasting, I remember when we were selling ours, the time wasters, the people that had no intention of buying.
A magic cottage?
Did I hear right?

Good gracious.

Forgive me smiling but does everybody do that, fall over the step there?
Same as me.

Mm.
Claims to be.
Oh yes, yes.
Indeed yes.
He claims that's been done.
Exactly.
That's right, yes.
Some people can, yeah.
Mm.
Well, yeah.
In his last chapter in the book he claims he did a a beam me up scottie business and.
Yeah exactly, yes.

Hang on, hang on, hang on.

Because.

Mm.
Mm.

Decisions.
Oh..
Mm.
Er yes.
Well it's the only time we get chance to talk at the moment is n't it?
Mm.
Well that's true, yes.
Yeah.
You could get twenty four hours continuously with Neville could n't you?
God strewth.
yourself.
What, what is this?
No.
. Ooh.
Bring me thing with me.
Easily carry that.
No I do n't think so.
No no.
It smells like burning.
Mattresses or blankets, the carpets.
No.
I've not had a blow lamp going this morning at all.
It's probably come in with the door being open.
It may even be the school you know?
Burning some rubbish in the er.
in the incinerator thing they've got there.
Cor it really pongs does n't it?
Mm.
Many different types of smoke and pong.
Wood smoke, when you're camping is.
it's, exactly.
Yeah yeah.
Oh yes.
Yeah, well it was worthwhile was n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
That's really org yeah.
Jolly good.
Mm.
No.
We went camping again?
Well that's not very likely!
No thank you.
I do.
I'm not gon na go.
Oh I see.
Yes.
No I know what you mean.
Yeah.
Yes I have a hazy recollection of that.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Seems an awful long time ago in some ways, you know, camping.
Yet other ways it does n't Nina.
The erm difference in cer some things can seem a long time ago and some are relatively recent.
It does n't really seem all that long since our lads in shorts, you know?
And there they are thirty nine.
No no seriously.
Oh I know.
Yeah.
Oh.
Which ones did you heave, by the way?
Oh my god, yeah.
Well hang on, no.
You did n't put a definite no on economy seven did you?
Oh well fair enough.
No I'm talking about economy seven in case you heave.
any more.
Mm.
She prefers er far prefers gas cooking I know, but.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Ah is that the one the Barratt type place?
Yeah well.
Yes.
Exactly, yes.
It's the same estate is n't it?
It is yeah.
The same address, same area.
Yeah.
But there's quite a difference in price if you notice.
And thirty something for that.
Thirty seven I think it was, something like that.
Could be wrong.
This is this is, this is.
Mhm.
I do n't like either, to be honest with you, but there we are.
Well if you weigh that other one up the end one.
Yeah.
There would n't be room for the caravan to start with.
No I do n't think so, no.
Yeah.
No.
I do n't think there would be.
Mm.
Mm.
Full stop.
That'd be it.
Mm.
No room for a garage.
No parking a car is there?
From what I can see of it.
Oh yeah.
It's erm important to remember by the way.
Well some estates, not many of course, but some estates have got a no go area for caravans parked do n't they?
Mm.
I do n't think we're likely to meet it here to be honest with you but yes you do get it.
Well I'm just saying I just said that we're not likely to get it here.
But erm it would be a damn sight safer down here would n't it?
It would n't get vandalized, broken into scratched, bashed or whatever.
Tell me, the.
Mm.
Go on.
Yeah I read it.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Depends what you mean by privacy of course, but go on.
Privacy or privacy as they seem to say these days, do n't they, sometimes?
carry on saying it whether it's right or wrong.
Same with controversy and controversy.
I know, I still.
It's a real controversy though.
Controversy.
God, you've got me at it.
You see?
How easily you can change.
Good gracious me.
Did you notice this morning on the box, the er weather girl?
She uses controversy and er.
Our friend what's his name, Mike is it?
Yes.
He did the accidental I'm sure, controversy.
Mm.
And she.
Well it is for us because we've always been saying it.
But I do n't see any reason why it should be easier.
Controversy, controversy.
It's just accent on the.
Mm.
Fed up with plaster up me nose and.
Oh strewth, yeah.
There's quite a lot of it to do yet.
Well we're it's it's the er first principles, prepare your surfaces is n't it?
Which we're doing.
No.
But that's the mm.
Well we've finished the burning off in there.
Yeah so that's one pong gone.
Very largely gone.
It still lingers on a bit though.
There's not an awful lot more filling to do, but there is a bit of course.
I sincerely hope not.
No there's no more plastering.
No.
No.
Just filling now.
Imperfections you know?
Joints and, stuff like that.
And that, it's a pity about that but I'm leaving the damn thing.
Fancy putting boss white?
Oh I know.
If it works leave it alone, but.
erm on balance it's best left on and to just.
Yes.
Oh yes.
I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but well.
Well.
Well that's a p yes exactly, yes.
Cos.
and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss white.
Cos it goes rock hard that stuff, over the years you know?
Boss white.
Do you mean that's why they used boss white?
Possibly.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh quite, yes.
Mm.
Have you noticed that by and large, not all the time of course but I should say that eighty percent of the time birds face that way?
Mm.
Cos see that pigeon is now.
In the tree, yeah.
Mm.
By far the majority of the time.
Oh god, yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Facing basically west, are n't they?
Mm.
pardon?
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
You do n't often get one pigeon though do you?
There's usually at least two of them.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Yes that was getting on my wick that door, yeah.
Mm.
I was bunged up before I started this.
bunged up now.
Well and the fact that it was just their garden, and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden, it would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or something like that or somebody and yeah.
I mean why pick on one garden and systematically.
I do n't think they'd been actually taken from what I can gather.
They slashed them about, yes.
Cut them all.
Mm.
Oh according to Josie, I really do n't know about all the cabbages, it might consist of one or two.
Funny business, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
That's Yvonne's mother is n't it?
Yeah.
Did n't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil?
Mm.
So I sh.
yes.
She's probably fallen out with some kid or other.
Oh no no no no no.
If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road, then fair enough, but.
Mm.
Mm.
Well we think so.
Obviously there's others that do n't think so, but not everybody thinks so.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh true, true.
They're not an ug ugly thing.
Mm.
No.
No.
Oh yeah it's very small beer really is n't it?
Compared to some of the dodges they get up to.
Mm.
Light?
Er well no the, well at the front.
Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I do n't know exactly.
I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit and see where it's best.
But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway.
of course is cable running to it providing it with power.
I'll probably run it from the garage.
About the easiest source.
Do you mean the return?
If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage, that little bit there?
There's two feet or something.
I am, yes.
Well what do you mean then, the corner?
Yes, you mean literally on the corner?
The apex of two.
Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It'll screw drive on to a flat surface.
Brickwork.
Yeah.
Certainly it will.
Yeah.
Mm.
Above a vandal.
Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it.
Er up a step ladder I mean, not a.
I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but.
Ah well that would illuminate the er see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going down towards the garage.
Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face but.
then a percentage of light will go round the corner.
Well cos lights do n't go round corners but.
No.
No that would throw the front door into shadow would n't it?
Mm.
Mm like I say that would be mm.
Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage.
For feed, you know?
Mm.
Well that's the easiest bit,.
To the circuit, yeah.
That is.
It will be helpful though, having a light there.
Because at night, you get a percentage a a.
degree of light I should say from that street lighting, but not an awful lot.
Mm.
And for people coming in, going out for the step.
whatever, you know?
Mm.
It'll be a quite sufficient spread to, to cope with the er entrance to the garage I mean, you know?
Mm.
I still think two rows of erm pavers stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know?
To put there.
There's only one problem.
Well the approach to the garage, yeah.
The drive.
Er yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
Yeah.
The usual thing, yeah.
You get a what?
No, not if you put sodium chlorate down.
Nothing'll grow then.
Good grief.
If you what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Up the sides, yeah.
Yeah?
No, well that does n't really matter.
I mean the erm in fact, there's only one fairly tight path you can follow to get the car in.
Into the side.
If you think about it.
It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in.
Not necessarily, no.
No.
I do n't mean put down like bloody tramlines.
A railway line in.
No no.
Actually it's quite attractive.
that actually.
I was looking at it again this morning.
Yeah.
Ooh hark at her!
Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Oh lifting them you mean? you mean?
Oh god.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well there was at the time obviously.
Cos do you remember there was that erm monstrous creation I should say erection, erection for erm.
The foundation, exactly.
I know, yeah.
No, I'm not with you.
Yes.
I'm with you now.
It's fairly deep eight inches down, the bricks?
I know I went quite a way down.
I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a ruddy house there would n't you?
That's only er I do n't know.
It's the same with the greenhouse.
They'd have had a nine inch thick.
erm solid concrete path in the centre.
Who the hell.
wants that?
In the middle of the co.
er of the greenhouse.
Oh there?
Yes, yes.
Well oh dear.
I've kept my eyes open when we're going through Harford.
and there's no signs of work.
Mark you it was n't a brilliant day was it?
So.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Cos those were definitely new ones, ready for placing in.
A, a pile of stones.
Oh yeah.
Well no.
No no, no.
No, straight to the tip.
That's not the tip.
Yeah.
That's not the tip.
You've never been to the tip.
I do n't think, no you've not.
It's erm Tearscross way.
You know the quarry?
Well the quarry area anyway, the same road.
You can approach it two ways.
From erm.
No no no.
That's just bits they've had on various trucks.
Lorries and things.
No, no.
No no.
The tip is where I went.
The first time I went I followed the route recommended by Peter?
Peter which on a map looks quicker but it is n't cos it's a winding.
country road single track in a lot of directions.
Apparently yes.
No.
No they do n't they just they stick them on to.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
On indeed it would, yes.
It would.
Mm.
I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year though.
I hope to give the mixer a caning this year.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes, yes.
In some ways it is sensible, yes because you're carrying muck down.
Yeah.
I mean down, when we've done down here we've pu god been putting mats down and lord knows what to.
oh yeah.
Mm.
But the erm ceiling rose and preferably the light switch could do with replacing.
Mm.
Well the, the lighting switch is n't so clever either.
And before I put too much back I want to have the floorboards up to clear.
