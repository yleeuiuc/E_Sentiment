He would n't be able to you know, okay he'd probably potter about on a restoration job but I mean that's not.
Well yeah, but I mean it's not providing half the business is it?
Yeah.
So I mean I I just could n't.
see him being able to do the work.
That's it.
Yeah.
Think they're just gon na have to cut back.
I mean your mum'd save a lot of money if she found a l job locally where she did n't have to travel.
Go on the bus.
I mean it must, well she must spend ten quid a week on bus fares.
Yeah.
But she's got all that way to walk.
It'd be a lot cheaper.
Well she could take the.
Dad does n't use it does he?
Can you imagine him letting her use it?
He'd have a fit.
What?
Yeah.
Did you phone up that garage?
Yeah?
Mm.
Really?
Must be a fairly new garage cos I've never heard of them before.
I've never seen them advertised before.

No, he do n't care.
His left eye?

But like said when she tested him, she said it's erm.
He uses it.
If it's er a proper squint are you listening?
If it's a proper squint they do n't use it.
They do n't seem to use it.
Yeah, he likes.
He'll soon be howling.
Let me get to him.
I do n't.
You'll give me a heart attack.
What's your daddy doing to you?
No, do n't do it.
He was chewing his toes this morning.
He was, he was chewing his toes.
Yeah.
Yeah cos he was going blah blah.
He was screwing his face up but he was still doing it.
Battle of wits this is.
I think you're gon na lose.
Well if you take them off and then they wo n't be out will they?
There, that fooled you.
He's trying to grab you.
Just be thankful you have n't got longer hair, I'm telling you.
No we've had a bill from the council.
That bill.
Yeah.
It's twenty one pounds.
It does n't say when it's supposed to be paid by so I think we might forget it for now.
Do n't you?
No there was n't.
No I know.
I think, well we'll hang on to it and then they can send us a reminder ca n't they?
It does n't say anything on there.
No.
No.
They are really.
What can you do?
Your brother's brought the wood.
Yeah.
A fiver.
Oh it's quite a bit.
I have n't you know cos it was n't very nice when he brought it.
He was gon na stack it over this side.
But I said no, cos we do n't it yet.
I said we want it behind the shed.
But whether they've actually put it behind the shed or what I do n't know.
Well that's where you told me to tell him to put it, behind the shed.
At the back?
No yeah you said the back.
I dunno.
Away from the fence!
Yeah I'm sure it's alright.
You should n't take him out there.
Alright.
Is that alright, where it is?
Sorry?
It's pretty good wood though I think.
I think your brother wa he was slightly worried about the amount he could take in his car.
Thought he said something about the suspension.
Mm oh.
Probably.
I did n't look.
You know I just sort of.
At that particular point he was whingeing away so.
I do n't know.
I'll go and check.
That Dave's a funny old chap is n't he?
Did n't say much.
No.
Mm, I think we're warm enough now.
Just burnt me finger.
Do you wan na put him in his walker?
Please.
No it's not all.

Mummy's gon na do yours next.
Expectant look on his face.

I'll switch the oven off then.
Oh do you want any bread or is that alright?
How many slices?
Oh.
Oh.
You can have the crust.
Oh.
Alright.
Best bit of the bread.
Oh it's massive.
Do you pick these loaves or do they feel sorry for you when they give them to you?

Oh I see that.
I'm surprised I'm allowed to touch the loaf.
I am.
It's fresh anyway.
It's really fresh is n't it?
Is that alright?
Examining it!
Is it alright?
Oh I ca n't cut bread.
You know me dear.
What do you mean?
When?
Well it used to last a day if that, and I never used to cut any of it.
He used to eat it all.
Yeah I know.
It was only at weekends.

Yeah, yeah.
That's a bill.
Pardon.
Did that taste alright, that lasagne?
Oh shut up.
If we had a microwave it would n't be, would it?

Yeah.
Somebody there I think might like a bit of that.
You like lasagne do n't you boy?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's had a really good sleep actually.
He went to sleep about half eleven.
Mm.
He nearly managed to sit himself up Melvin.
He sort of pulled backwards and hit that chair, got off that chair.
And he was sort of he managed to get his legs round but he just could n't quite get his body up to sit up.
He's not a dog.
So I do n't think it'll be long before his crawling forwards.
Bless his little cotton socks.
Yeah that's you.

Ooh.
Mm left the window open.
Dunno what I fancy for my lunch.
Did n't have my breakfast till about ten o'clock.

So Alright baby, do you wan na drop of milk?

No.
Nothing.

The only thing she offers is sort of help with Peter but that's because she wants Peter.
Not because she wants to help us.
Twenty eight is n't it?

No I'm not.

Er yeah, we've nearly finished.
Yeah, it's brilliant!
Er no Cos it's up like patterned on the on like, two walls and then we've got like like a balloon different balloon erm wallpaper.
And some of it's gone up alright, but he put a couple of strips up last night and it all bubbled and then he I heard him this morning shwooh!
And ripped it off the wall!
Yeah but, no you see the wallpaper actually stretched!
So I think when it.
Alright, yeah!
He did it once before.
You know,?
And it wo n't go round the corners!
So I said well you do n't go round corners!
Oh, no, no it wo n't stick properly!
Oh,!
So I have n't.
and it putting down properly, it will go round corners!
Rather than catching it!
But I mean, no, he's done alright!
But er I mean I'm not you know, there to criticise him.
Yeah.
Well I did all the paint work.
All the glossing and that and er he's done the wallpapering.
So, that was good!
Listening to them, I mean, they're so frightened.
Shall have get some more should n't we?

Oh yeah.
Oh yeah!
Well yeah, that's true enough with him!
So that's true enough!
He said something about a will!
Oh, there's my car keys!
I must have threw them away again!

Yeah!
If I, I'll throw them away!
Cos I sort of tend to collect the sweety papers in the same pocket.
It empties the pocket and I thought the car keys were in there, my car keys.
And erm thrown, thrown them away, out of my pocket!
And I did n't think of looking there!
Had my car keys in there.
Yeah!
Silly!
Ay?
Scatty batty!

Oh alright then and shut up!
He said I, he said I did n't offend you did I?
I said, no, she'd know if you've offended, he said, cos I'm sure you'd say something!
He said, oh, you'd probably hit me!
So I said, yeah, that's right!

Sit on a proper chair!
Ah?

Oh he, well he potters around and goes slowly!
Like a bloody tortoise!
I told you I sat round there once and it took him an hour a whole hour, and I'm, I'm not exaggerating to fit or to put up half a sheet of wallpaper!
And it was n't the full length of the wall because they got a dado rail it was half.
It took an hour!
One sheet!
I was getting so frustrated!
I was gon na say, Kevin, do you want me to do that?
I'll do it!

I do n't mind if you do n't!
Yeah, I do n't mind this painted.
Well, if somebody walks round with a pen or a pencil, or crayons.
Yeah I know!
So, I mean, what's the point of you know making it look really, really nice and you know, all you could is just slap a coat of paint over it!
Honestly, I think you'd be silly to decorate it!
Yeah I really do.
Yeah.
Then when we can choose you know?
Oh yeah, woodwork painted!
You know, change that to white.
Oh yeah, do all the woodwork and that, but just paint, literally paint over the walls.
I mean it'll be fresher cos the paper's not bad is it?
Then er really.
I think it'll be the best thing, you know, just in case you do get crayon and felt tip over the walls and that!
And then you have n't ruined wallpaper that you've gone out and bought especially.
Oh yeah, decorate that and the hall.
Yeah.
But I mean, this is gon na be like the family room so, I mean, it is gon na get knocked about a bit!
Yeah.

He's tired.
He's tired.
Ian know he owes that or what?
I'm go, I'm gon na be.
Oh yeah!
You can.
Yeah, it was.
Ah!
Oh she'd mean it, yeah!
Yeah, yeah you told me.
Yeah, you told me yeah.
That old!
You did.
What?
What was he saying then?

Yeah.
Yeah.
He can have.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well cos had to be did n't he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would n't of worried you!
No!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's quite good that that chap had actually showed you the right quote were n't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well he ca n't do a thing about it!
He knows he ca n't!
He's got the car!
Well they're such pigs are n't they!
Yeah, well tha, they've dropped themselves right in it now!
In actual fact, what you wan na do now is to er perhaps have a little er letter writing to Avon.
Yeah.
Tell them what you think of them.
And er let them yeah let.
Yeah do.
them know what sort of, how have behaved.
Yeah.
So complete with threats!
And er just tell them that er the way they've behaved, that you thought the way to.
I mean though innit?
Well.
You thought the way they behaved was er despicable!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah but you must complain to Avon though!
Cos Avon's a big insurance company.
And I've done.
I've done lots of work for them in the last couple.
of years.
Yep.
Yeah yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
That's right, yeah.
Right, well if give me their address, then we can get a letter.
Yeah, it's at at er.
Wentworth.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Oh well, you know you can draft a letter up.
Yeah, just say that you were very.
disappointed with the way their agents, i .e. Quadling er have been behaving!
Dealing, yeah.
And er er also mention the fact that er er you know for a fact or, or, you know that er the other quotes that er put in a bill, put in a bill for a er about a hundred pound more than what I did, or whatever, whatever.
Mm.
it was!
And er they'll know this and er.
then, then just tell them the facts you know?
Yeah.
And also mention that er this bloke came round and issued a offered er int, er intimidation and threats!
Legal threats as well!
Yeah, and some days you need to.
And er you know put it down in writing because that way Avon will then se see and the, hang on!
What's Quadling playing at here!
We're not having that!
Yeah.
We're not having this!
And also state that over the years er your father used to run the business done hundreds of jobs for Avon Insurance at, and er also you yourself have done jobs for Avon Insurance before who have never ever had any trouble whatever so ever!
Like er you know, with any of the work we've done.
er it's always been er guaranteed i .e. if a customer was not satisfied, then one hundred percent we will rectify whatever it is they're not satisfied with.
Mm.
We always maintain that our word is our bond all of our work.
And then to be treated er as out and out er criminals, like this Quadling had done with us is just beyond all bounds of having reasonable.
Mm.
business sense!
It's not!
Not over the phone.
Spoken as in but it's you know.
I know.
But that's intimidation that is, threats.
at you.
Okay.
That's right.
Yeah.
By the way, I've told you I got charged er fifteen pounds did I?
Oh I told you Mel, did I?
And ten pounds from the bank!
Cos I was twenty five pence overdrawn!
So I wrote a stinking letter to them!
A one of the one of the sentences,, how dare you authorise the withdrawal of fifteen pounds from account without prior notification!
Or at least having the decency and good manners to at least let me know what you'd done!
Yeah!
And er, anyway I got this terrific letter back!
You should, well granddad was there about half an hour reading it!
It was er one foolscap plus of, of words you know, explaining what, what they'd done and all this and why they'd done it!
They credited you?
And yeah, they've gone and re-credited me for the fifteen pound!
Yeah!
Great!
Well then, no, what it is they've charged for each.
Yeah.
cheque that you.
Yeah.
you do about a quarter.
I would n't of minded, like I said to the bloke er if he, if I'd been er a hundred pounds overdrawn or fifty quid overdrawn or something like that, I would n't of minded so much because I knew.
that I would be overdrawn.
Mm.
And I'd know that I'd incurred that expense.
But er but a mere twenty pe pence!
I thought, it's an insult my flipping intelligence!
But it was, you know.
Well anyway I got this lovely letter back!
Oh well!
So letter and er and evening compiling it has er gained me my fifteen pound back!
Yeah.
No it does n't hurt to write a few letters.
Oh David!
Yes.
Oh it's.
Yeah.
So why did he come round and see you?
Start again on booze!
Did he?
Well if, if he's got an M O T on it he'll be able to run it until the M O T.
runs out.
Oh well he can run until then, then and just take it out to and leave it there.
Has he?
Yeah.
And what are they doing about it, nothing!
I reckon it ought to be compulsory that.
Like a car needs to go in for the M O T, you've got ta.
Mm, you've got ta have your eyes tested.
for your eyes.
Yeah.
In Germany you have to carry, if you wear glasses, you have to carry a spare pair of glasses with you!
Yeah.
I had to do this in Adelaide you know, when I went for my D S V license.
I had loads of dots in front of me you know, in this machine.
Colour blind.
and er yeah, I had to er tell them what numbers were what er letters.
Mm.
numbers rather were coming, coming up, you know?
And I just ran through them, you know, it was no problem to me.
But I can image yo, yo, you can stand.
You'd fail.
doing it.
So and er ooh I had they did er this old butterfly thing as well, the old psychology bit as well, you know.
What does that look like?
You know!
A blob of ink squashed together what else!
You know?
Yeah.
And er how old?
That was the first time I had to cough for anybody that was, as well.

I did n't particularly like that idea.
Just testing for a hernia, I told I had n't got one!
Yeah.
It's like that er truck driver that came into your place when er you and er that bloke that used to there.
And a he came in there and er for his glasses and er old was having a headache actually everything.
Oh yeah.
and he, he was a er said he was nearly enough, near enough blind!
Mm!
And here he is driving trucks around the countryside!
Yeah.
And he persisted as well!
Yeah, he did n't need glasses for driving!
You know er!
The old, old ones are the worst, I tell you!
Yeah.
Well anybody over forty years old it ought to be, it ought to be compulsory!
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well what, I'll never forget this chap do up on Avenue Road he were like that!
He'd been driving for sixty years, you've never had an accident.
Yeah, I mean, his vision was absolutely appalling!
I said, well you should n't be driving!
See even with glasses on!
No, my driving's alright ma!
But he ca n't hear nothing about!
It's a privilege.
I'll always maintain that people with glasses know they've got something wrong with their eyes so the chances are if they're wearing glasses then they can see properly!
It's the guy that has n't got glasses, that's the guy you've got ta worry about.
Yeah.
What's the time?
Any idea?
Oh right.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Ooh!
Excuse me!
That was n't now.

He's ai n't he?


Do n't take it seriously?
You can bet your bottom dollar some teams would go bananas on that!
Not half!
For the.
It's is it?
Mhm.
That's not bad!
Yeah.
Oh that's nice is n't it?
A Humber.
Oh look at the old indicators!
.Moggy Minor did that to me!
Got a little pink.
are n't they?
Must be one of the first ones out.
Mm.
So did n't have no indicators on its side, just one of the things popped up!
Do n't you remember, oh no you do n't.
I was sort of driving along, what?
Damn thing's slowing down!
I was looking for this blooming half thing sticking out!
They stopped them about nineteen fifty nine, something like that.
He's driving around without his glasses on!
Why is n't he tested?
Fancy having a car for that many years!
Yeah.
Yeah.
They are yeah!
Well I'm pleased with my Citreon.
The only thing I do n't like about it is the fact that it's not a a three litre engine.
Oh!
But er it does everything I want it to.
Ca n't wait to get that Sierra!
Yeah, you've done well with that.
Yeah.
Ay?
Yeah, I think he's getting a bit attached to it.
You sure.
I watched that once.
Mind you, it's only five minutes though innit?
We watched it once did n't we?
It was on before and I did n't find it very funny at all!
Yeah.
I just never watched it.
No, it's not worth watching!
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
But half of it you could n't understand could you?
Cos they were going off in their like their lingo.
and he talks like that and sh what the hell are they saying!
Yeah.
Yeah, it's erm black boy.
Oh!

Was he?
Yeah.
Dunno how he does it.
Yeah.

Oh!

If he's a hologram machine he should n't need to eat.
If he's a hologram he should n't need to eat things.
Where are they then?
Where's Fun in the Sun?
Today?

Oh I've got a right pair here!
I really have!
Things like that they ought to put you in a room together, you'd be fine would n't you!
Oh!
Ha!

Oh I did n't get up to him.
Not with the bashing.
Have you looked at him this morning?
No.
Well he, stayed like that.
Head on the head on the mattress and duvet over him!
Mm.
He takes it with him now, so it's probably good idea actually, take the blanket off.
Yeah.
He was warm before, probably a bit too warm.
Shall we go upstairs?
Mhm.

Yeah, that's nothing!
If we have vegetables every day, how long would that last?
Grow our own.
You can freeze most vegetables.
Yeah.
Yeah and they used to blanch them first.
Most vegetables you have to blanch first.
Just put them in boiling water for about thirty seconds.
Yeah, so it's no problem.
Yeah.

Alright, you can have fucking newspaper to wipe your arse with!
You can!
I would n't mind if I went out and spent it on myself, but I did n't!

It's all fo food or Peter or the house or something else!
