Well, you do and yet we want heat in the, in the pipes.
We'll see.
Nothing on telly till eight.

And there was some mystery about her because the kids ' names unless my mother always called her by her, by her name before she was married, but she always called her, and yet the boys was.
Course, as a kid you do n't think of that, but there was never was a father there or something so not that I could ever remember so that, that was the fire crackling.

No, but it was still like a political broadcast in a way.
from each party.
But the any answers was.
the any answers was er quite good this week.
I thought.
A bit the anti-smoking bit, on a bit too long.
Do n't you think so?
I do n't know, I'm not sure.
Well he do n't smoke much.
I in fact now, he does n't smoke when Madge is in the room.
He waits till she's gone to bed.
Really?
Yeah.
Well they dare n't sa, er.
Yes, well.
Yes, but they used to say cigar smoking's not as bad as cigarette smoking.
Cigars.
Mm.
That's what they.
that's what they say.
and Tom only smokes a pipe now, he do n't smoke cigarettes.
Well he just did n't smoke in cars.

You do n't eat nearly as much as you used to.
How?
I know, but, but you used to have mid-morning snack.
Yes, I'm not disagreeing.
Well, that was when you were young!
Ah I know.
Well you need n't go into all that.
I know but you.
you do n't, you.
Recording.
Oh so that should be alright then.
should n't it?
Yes after all that.
No, after all that trouble changing the I do n't know why it went.
went wrong the first time do you?
Yes.
They've ate all the seed and that bread's still there.
I'm making a cup of tea.
No.
Yeah.
Did you hear that?
The robin was at the back door.
I've thrown another handful.
And the blackbird.
Do you want some whisky in your tea?
You're not going out.
Is it still recording?
I did n't know whether you'd put the, stopped it.
No you can leave it, might as well leave it on.
Yes.
Well it's funny it's working this time int it?
I've thrown some out.
They've got some.
Ah after all that trauma.
I know, shall I put the gas fire on, as well?
I'm not very warm.
I mean you did the same with that as you did with the other did n't you?
Well you get obsessed with that but you're comparing it with yours.
You're comparing it with our.
thing with our system.
Yes.
You put the A in.
A.
Well you, you always do on yours when you're recording on our er set do n't you?
But you're obsessed with the position of the, the tape.
Leave alone and I'll sort them out.
Well.
That's it.
Now do you want any cake with that second cup of tea?
There's not.
Yeah there's half of it left.
Well I shall be in a minute, I've only just got to go in the kitchen and get it.
No!
It wo n't matter for a minute or two.
How big?
Well what's all that in aid of?
You need n't sing on it.
Shut up!
And eat that cake.
Is it as good as mine or better?
Yes Is this as good as mine or better?
This is Madge's cake.
It's not heavy!
I think it's too cold to snow.
That mark's gone off my arm, I think that erm bandage was too tight.
Well I do n't know, it's.
I do n't know that it is.
It gave me a bit of support but.
I know but I should have thought by now it'd've been better.
Well I think as you get older you take longer to heal.
If it's, if there's not any frost we could go to Sainsburys in the morning.
And do some shopping.
Hmm do n't be silly! big shopping on the bus.
Besides it does n't even go in till about about every hour.
Not very often.
Well I'm alright for everything till about Tuesday.
He did n't say.
Mm eat all that cake, you're not giving that to the birds.
They've not ate, ate half the potatoes and bread that's there now.
Hmm.
There goes the marzipan, all on the floor.
You cost me a fortune in soap.
What are you giving that cake to the birds for?
I told you not to.
What are you giving that to the birds for?
I think so, that's mine.
Now finish that cake.

Lit it's a little Russian one.
But it, it's not go not got any gadgets on.

No we had about an hour or so.
Well you fly and.
This is, er yeah it's the Eiffel Tower, not the Thames, the Seine.
Yes Eiffel Tower.
Yeah it's the Eiffel Tower we went on that boat.
That's what, oh no we were on a boat and we took that, but it was a similar boat to what we went on.
Yes.
No we took we took er that was, that's a lovely trip if you go to Paris.
Well we only, on the way down.
on the way down, and it was a lovely Sunday morning and er, you know, it was.
well one of the girls said to me who sort of tagged on to us, she was on her own, er she said er what was the highlight of the holiday and she said that trip down the Seine.
and the Sunday morning sort of all round Paris and all that.
Mm.
Yeah there'd be a lot there then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes and you'd've had to have cancelled anyway would n't you?
I always wanted to go but when Tito died I said to Arthur ooh it might be a bit risky.
And then it got that it blew over did n't it?
And so w.
we've never been.
Yes.
Well someone gave me a lovely address in erm mm.
Mm.
Well I know everybody er I've spoken to really thought.

It was getting expensive.
Mm.
No.
Have you lost your headache from this morning?
Jackie er er said you'd got a headache this morning, has it gone?
Have they got flu?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
But I just remember.
And that's what's shoulder.
Take that picture from the it's come off that hook.
Well my, I rang my sister, said are.

because it's her er daughter's birthday and I usually give a present to take round.
Ooh she said er I've got a bad cough.
No that was young sister.

It's the aerodrome yeah.

Yeah well.

Put those.

Mm.
Mm.
She's doing alright.
Mm.
to get the er how big they are yeah.
And it showed you all the sort of countries of the world, you know, on lights and, and that, and which light was for which wh when they took us round the er.
control room you know.
Mind that glass!
A telephone.
Mm.
Aye.
Very very.
Mm.
Mm.
Four!
I know my, my sister's er grandson, he's had a computer, he's fourteen and er anyway, oh he wanted a bigger one costing about eight hundred pounds.
And now he's, they've got one and I think it was about five hundred pounds, they bought this one s but they managed to sell the other one for about a hundred and fifty they say.
Now he's got that, he says he wants a wordprocessor.
And they're expensive are n't they?
Ooh he, he's m mind you he, he reckons that's what he wants to do when he's older but I mean the life, or the career of anybody in computers is not very long is it?
Because they're changing so rapidly.
I mean my, one of my friend's sons, he was a computer man, he was working on his own but he's in his I should think he's getting on for about forty six and he was doing freelance but this recession the people who er the firms who were employing him are using their own staff and they're not calling on him now and er he's not done any computing for twelve months.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes we kept going there when yeah.
Yeah.
They're, yeah.
Yeah.
Well erm I mean Andrew, he was very clever, he went to university and as I say now he's nearly fif getting, getting towards fifty well even so he's buying a house and last December things got so bad he took a job as a dustman a at Anstey, he lives.
at Anstey, and he said well, got to pay the mortgage.
What as to.
Oh.
Oh it is really is n't it?
Well you do do n't you?
But.
And especially these computers where they change every.
every few years do n't they?
Yes.
No they're not, it's supposed to be being used.
I do n't know whether you go down Valmer Road do you?
Mm.
Oh they've still got a small part there.
So you just retired in retired just about the right time.
You're in the drawing office?
Ooh we do n't want to know.
We do n't want to know all this.
Drawing office.
You said that.
Mm.
Mm.
Well, he used to come home and say that and I'd say put a suggestion in but.
if he did I had to write to out for him.
Still we did n't do too badly.
Anyway how long have you got to go before you retire?
Ooh.
Mm.
Not staying longer.
No, no.
Still you might get a a big redundancy pay out if you do.
Is that.
Yes you get a pension.
Oh.
Not as good.
Mind you how many years were you in your pension?
Not all that many.
No you were n't.
the B U did n't have a pension scheme till after the war.
Do you get a pension in yours?
Yes, it's a good idea is n't it?
Well my friend never paid.
Yes.
And I said ooh.
Which was a lot in those days.
Well you had a rise as well.
So he anted his up.
I mean ten shillings was a we a we was.
years ago.
Oh yes because now mind you the B U pension's quite good because every year we, we get a p a percentage increase.
but I mean ours does n't, mine does n't, I mean mine's only a small one because I have n't done many years there.
But er, oh that's alright if it does but the B U is, is, you know, a really good one.
Mm.
Still perhaps you get the earnings thing do n't you?
Earnings related as well sort of thing.
Has it?
Oh, oh.
Oh dear I'm not au fait with those things now.
Yeah my nieces are doing that, Audrey and er well her husband's self employed so er.
Yes they did.
Well they can do now, in those days they did n't.
No.
No they did n't, no, we did n't in our place.
Mm.
Although Peter my friend's he, he did that but er it did n't come to much, they'd've saved it or something, one job, cos he was made redundant about three times and er one, one place he was at they're supposed to have kept it and paying him it now but I do n't know how they came about that bu because actually they we played him a dirty trick, they persuaded him to leave his job and then about nine years or probably less than that later you know and he was out again, redundant and, you know, I think they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five pounds a week from, off that one, which is.
Is that recorder still on?
Oh that's alright, finish one tape.
Mm.
Well if you, if you finish three we're.
You've not seen Jackie's new lounge.
have you?
It's beautiful int it?
Have you finished?
Why, what's the matter with those?
Really?
Ooh.
Ooh!
Oh, oh I did n't know that, mm.
Mm.
Who, who was who was the.
Ooh!
Oh I see, Maples.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
Cos we had Linekars, course they've gone out of business, but when he came, when the boss came to this one he reckoned one of these was a bit out did n't he?
Yes.
Mm.
Tt oh that's sad.
Oh what a shame.
Yeah oh of course it was just before Christmas.
Cos I've not seen it with the curtains.
Do you want a drop more sherry?
You pour it out Arthur, I ca n't get that cork off very easily.
have a martini.
No!
You ca n't mix the drinks.
I thought Tom might have a whisky if he's got a.
What sort is it?
Oh it's the same sort is it?
Yes it was a Sierra.
Maroon colour?
No!
I do n't think he could've been insured do you?
Well except for third party, how long.
he left it there, do you?
Yes but I mean you get get the repair done do n't you?
Well erm.
and he said it was n't cos he.
M Martin said when he.
No well that's what I said i er and probably perhaps when you were on holiday.
It looks very clean does n't it?
Yeah, mm, that's what, yeah.
Mm.
Yes, mm, s see low, no.
Mm.

Yeah.
Oh that lady who came with this, she said er Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it, and she said how much did they charge you, twenty five pounds or thirty pounds?
So I said no, only twenty.
So apparently she said ooh he probably charges, perhaps if he's not very he reduces the price but funny she said twenty five pounds.
She knew, not quite together.
No it was a minute afterwards because I thought.
oh he's come back for the, this, to show to you.
I thought perhaps he'd been to you and sort of were you interested and he he'd come back.
But it was only a second.
No.
after er sort of I'd more or less half a second and I thought oh he's come back again.
No!
No what the they'll do, they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things wo n't they?
And then they'll see how many are sort of used a lot and percentage and that's what they'll do.
Oh, oh yes yes.
Well it says on the, on the thing we have to fill in er if any of the speakers is of non.
English or something a different race if you like, you're to put it down.
Because you only have to identify them by a name not not a.
not, not the surname, just J John or whoever.
and, but if any of them are of not U K origin.
you've got to put it down and say which one it is.
Oh did you see that tonight?
Oh I hate it when white girl gets an.
No I did n't see it last week.
We did n't see last week's, I do n't know, was something else on?

Arthur do n't like.
do you?
Not really.
That, that programme that follows that, we've never looked at it before, Barrymore er did you look at that?
We saw it once before.
Yes, it was quite good really.
Yeah.
Yes.
I did n't see the beginning.
Yes.
Mm.
Then they had er some fatty, fat ladies, elderly ladies, doing the can-can.
That was good.
Similar to the Roly-Polies but this was a sort of erm an amateur group.
Doing it for charity or.
Oh well er it is nice is n't it?
Yeah, yeah.
Like the Roly-Polies, they were good were n't they?
I've not seen them lately have you?
Mm.
The old classic films.
But they're on too late at night, I ca n't stand.
late nights, can you?
Do you, can you stay up, have you got a television.
in your own bedroom?
Oh.
Not always.
When, last night?
Oh w well no you have n't got Sky, it's on Sky.
Yes, yeah I think we saw that.
No.
Well perhaps it'll be a good thing in some ways, we're getting too many.
You'll have no seed left before you're able to get to the shops to buy more.
Oh well.
Well we're not likely to miss those are we?
We get too many.
I should n't miss the pigeons all that much, I do n't mind the blackbird and the thrush and the robin but and a few starlings but I do n't like many pigeons about the garden.
They're too dirty.
Yes they are.
Are you very bread hungry, toast hungry?
Well you should be.
Well you did n't have much after your dinner yesterday did you?
Do n't be silly.
Not in this fog.
And I think it's freezing, the pantry was like an ice box.
I know there's no frost on the cars but it must still be cold.
The pantry.
I mean I.
I know I know but er.
I did n't.
It's just ever so cold.
What did you say?
Is it?
Oh I stand corrected.
You, you'd like to go back to school.
At your age.
You might.
Apparently Jackie's got.
got one of these Wa Walkmans.
Beverley bought it her.
Well you can plug into the radio on these.
That's you see the kids with them round their neck.
Listen to the radio, if, if you look at the.
I know but if you're out.
You see the kids walking by with them, do n't you?
And on the buses you sometimes see it.
See them.
The eggs are not done yet.
You want them.
Of ours?
No.
I should n't do it.
I should do your photo album.
It's about time that was done.
Well you can get a, get one.
No I should get another one, be too heavy to carry.
I know but ma make one or buy one of those and.
and extend it but I, I've not timed the eggs so you'll have to.
Yes it does!
I do n't like mine too done well.
Well, you never cook eggs that's why.
Two eggs.
Well we want we've got twenty tapes to run.
Well it something on it now.
Well that's only.
Now eat that egg.
Do you want another one?
No I'll have that one, this one will be done more.
That's done a bit more.
Well we do n't have it on Sunday because we always have a great big lunch so I never.
only have a light a light breakfast, you know we do.
If you can remember that far.
Mm not yet.
Yes, the other side of the toast.
Have you seen any programmes today, what's on?
Is yours alright?
These are the eggs I had from the butcher.
I do n't know.
Well we've got to find a new supplier have n't we?
Well there's that farm on the way to Oh!
Well it's, it's your hands, you wash them too much.
Well put your glasses on.
You tell me.
Well you tell me that,.
if I knock anything you say you should wear your glasses or.
I know you do.
That means your eyes are not working properly.
Mm.
Perhaps they ought not to have done.
Hmm not bad eggs are they?
Well they've eaten all that seed up have n't they?
Have you stared that new bag?
Well why put it right at the back?
Put it in one of those cardboard boxes we've got.
Plenty of those cartons about.
Chicken, I told you.
And the rest of that spring cabbage.
It was alright was n't it?
Did you like it?
Now eat all that marmalade.
Finish that bread, you do n't eat enough bread.
I think I'll get some more Seville oranges while they're in and make another.
I expect that's where they come from.
Well yes there's only only this time of the year that they're about so I think they must only grow them there that make the best marmalade.
This grapefruit and lemon's alright but although our Madge prefers this to Seville, I do n't.
Was that a?
No, no.
Ah yeah well I could n't quite see.
My eyes are getting worse I think.
Well let them clear th all the bits off first before you put any more out.
Is n't it, this marmalade's alright is n't it?
It's what I made the other week.
Jackie looked a bit better last night I thought, did n't you?
Mm?
Yes, she had sherry.
Did n't have much, you know.
Tom's getting fat though int he?
Well you're not.
You grizzle yours off.
But did, did you hear he might be made redundant?
Did you hear what he said?
He said erm cos the Gas Board o offices are moving to.
Birmingham or somewhere.
What after spending all that money on the house?
Give all those crusts to the birds.
Mm.
Do you want any whisky in it?
Or.
or have you had enough?
You're not going out.
It is on the green and yet the back seems to be clearer.
I'm going to try and manage without that er support on my arm today.

Do you think it's better than lemonade?
Tonic?
I ca n't stand the sweet saccharin in the lemonade!
Somebody's thumping!
Can you hear them?

Christmas puddings.
No, plum, I know they used to call it plum pudding!
I know!
Well they do n't now do they?
I gave one to Jackie and not heard whether she's had it or not.
Well, it's only polite to say whether if you.
give anybody anything er, to.
eat, i if they liked it or not is n't it?
Well probably not, with not, having the flu.
Well, she was n't well, I do n't know whether it was flu or.
Do n't you remember she spent Boxing Day in bed!
And the children did n't come so.
She we, well she looked ill I thought.
Mm.
Well, I think some days she's better than others, but on the whole she's not making much progress.
I do n't think she will.
I mean.
it's always been.
Landed!
I mean, she's always been that way nervous and.
right from when she was first married.
You're still neurotic in some things!
Ooh!
I would n't say nervous type.
Just a bit.
Neurotic over certain things.
Well, not normally.
Well, not in the same way Joan is.
But you get het up over silly things!
I do n't know!
Well, she's just coping, just dragging her arms int she?
Well they always did!
I mean, I can remember when she worked with me, every Christmas they changed one time they came to Leicester.
and the next year they went to Loughborough with their cousins.
And so, I suppose, they're keeping it up now.
You know Edna!
Ed and Meg.
Well, it's the same.

And I expect all the other's are dead!
Your mam was one of the youngest was n't she?

It's a piece of cake for you!
Somebody to wait on you!
Hand and foot.
And by the way, you've got your old trousers on did you know?
Yes you have!
Have you got rid of the cod liver oil taste yet?
Ooh!
Do n't know how you could drink it!

July, and I bet, bet my bottom dollar it was taken when Jackie and Tom were on holiday because of how their bit of front garden is all dried up and that building at the back was completed.
just before they stopped work the day before the July a fortnight holiday did n't they?
they'd got little bits to do, but there was.
still there, but they finished the main building.
at the end of June so that's when that was taken, you ought to of asked him when you saw him today.

and what else did she, that tobacco jar oh no.
you bought that did n't you?
I think.
no they did n't, they fetched seventy.

but I think a lot of those about they get astronomical.
mm.
mm, you'd of knocked them down.
you would have, or I would have.
you going to make us a cup of tea?
those chocolates have made me sick, take them out of this hot room.

well there the sort that you only want about a couple at a time at the most.
I do n't want any thing in me tea.
I put all the things ready.
I put all the things ready, but use the tea in the old, empty the old lot out before you fill it up, I put the packet there ready to open.
I sha n't.
yes.
oh they were cos he got a guarantee slip with it.
yes oh you bound.
that's why it was a bit difficult at first to break down.
of course they do n't silly, they made about twelve pounds or they were, I do n't know what they are now.
mm.
I do n't remember.
oh, oh I know that.

I'll ring him up today.
well that's what I said to you, but we did n't want to er visit again this weekend did we?, with last weekend.
having Madge and Tom.

well I do n't know, he's got a, a record player.
that it, well he, that his son Phil taped.
tape them well tape them for Marg, I do n't suppose he's done any since Marg died no.
they bought it for Marg when she was ill and Phil taped you know a lot of his records and some of Marg he'd got and that was it I suppose that's what sort Bill plays now.
You can fill my tea up.
not too much sugar.
well I think he likes never give him a, a chance when he's here.
too much gabbing.
never stops talking I want it filling up, not washing up.
I want the cup filling up, I thought you were washing them up.
no I want, I want another cup please.
I thought it was finished.
but its too cold to go in the garage now.
you know that back door key, I seemed to remember picking a key up thinking it was the garage key.
when I went in for the steamer.
and then I found out it was the back door key.
and, and the garage was unlocked so I did n't bother, I probably put it down when I got the steamer out of the cupboard.
well you need n't go in the cold, I've got a spare one in the drawer.
Was that one of the book's you got out on Friday?
cos some of them are getting.
no, you need n't, need n't take those you got out last Friday, its the earlier one's of which will be due next week I'm sure cos they've put up the prices now, its about ten P every day you have them out.

well she did have one it, she's had an operation, but er, I, she manages to go to the post on a Sunday afternoon, she must write to her sister in Australia, which makes a little round trip, a bit of exercise that's what you ought to do more of.
walking keep you fit its a bit you had a hair cut last week if you'd of left, if you had n't of had it done you could of taken this thing down to.
with you and recorded that.
you'd soon get into some arguments down there would n't you?
telling a tale.

walked away.
where's the nail clippers?
no there not.
no here they are, I know I've seen them somewhere on the window sill.

I thought there was a little bit on one that you had n't finished.
start a new one though if, if.
no of ours.
you were going to record Palmer Court were n't you?
you can do Palmer Court at four, till half past and half past four its erm.
I do n't know, you'll have to see, I mean switch it off and.
well you'll have to see what it is.
well I know what's on there, it wo n't be the same, its not, it wo n't be the same songs or items, will it?, they do n't repeat their repertoire their, there not different items I mean if we did and it was a repeat you could always wipe it out, put something on top, could n't you?
Have all the birds gone?
well yesterday the black bird was there and they ate till late, I think, I think they roost in that er holly bush.
mm and that I, I think they do and the robin and the, that one starling and the thrush, I think they all roost there cos they seem to be about every time you throw stuff out I just remembered Tom's father worked at er, the electric company.
in London B T H or G E C, I remember he told us that the last time you know because he was n't called up in the war he was reserved.
Ooh can you see the fog now swirling about, look at it.
you look, its all swirling about.
mm.
yeah it is, kept the kids in today.
well.
yes you do, you do n't always see them, what have you done with your glasses?, oh, I thought you might be sitting on them again.
yes, I should n't mind going away in a few weeks, if, if.
it looks like being a nice.
I would n't mind going on a bus tour again.
no, well I would n't mind going there, but, I meant for a first holiday, a little holiday I mean you enjoyed that did last April did n't you?
I know, but you do n't have the hassle though in those buses do you?
ooh I do n't know.
oh yeah, yeah.
mm.
well you get, get lots, lots of stops do n't you?
yes they do you have lots of stops.
yes they do.
no.
well it was like till nearly five the other day.
like mews.
no.
no well get plenty of food any how.
Have you given them all those potatoes?
I think they've gone off potatoes a bit.
any way I've only got enough for about two.
mm.
expect they do, well you always add some potatoes, salt to the potatoes, but er, I've only got enough for about two days.
so, the weather had better improve, I'll just have to buy some more from the milk man.
potatoes I'm talking about.
I know, but there not very good there, about three times as much.
well those people have them in stock for a long time.
I do n't know, most people buy them in bags today, those in, those across the.
Co-Op the other week were horrible.
I've got about enough for about two days, might be three.
I should think the weather will change before then.
I've not heard the forecast today have you?
no I doubt it, its.
oh I had to switch it off it was no good, it was all political was n't it?
the documentary that their going to put.
which will, it'll be interesting you see, listen.
well he was a bit of a slave driver I mean every body.
knew that he was a bit bombastic.
ooh he was n't very bright.
or he did n't try, well he did n't have a very happy childhood did he?
well you did n't try when you were at school, you told me yourself.
I mean a lot of it depends on, or perhaps his par well if his parents did n't really bother about him.
he said his mother did n't and then I do n't suppose.
and then I suppose er in those cases like yours children do n't er, unless their sort of erm pushed a bit or the parents show an interest in them.
mm.
mm.
I do n't.
well your finger is n't.
mm.
yeah.
any body could do it you mean.
what time is it?, is it time to put that radio on?
well just try it and I'll tell you what, I do n't know him.
it wo n't be the same.
it wo n't be the same songs, radio two.
no, its, its, Palm Court, we want to see Those Were The Days at four thirty.
just try this Palm Court see if its worth recording.
its not on until about two minutes past.
two minutes past, because they have two minutes of news I think.
Yes I think so, did n't you like it today?
did n't know about that fish, did you?
I mean you've got ta remember all those years back all those things can you?
yes but it seemed a bit far fetched, if they said that.
if that's been caught now why has n't that changed.
well in sixty nine or whatever.
no, no I'm not saying that we did, we did evolve.
but.
why has n't that fish that they caught recently evolved?
of what men?
I know several stages I know that.
I mean there were several stages before they got to present day man, but.
yes.
oh it is.
well not human's, but.
antecedence of humans, mm I do n't know.
mm.
mm yes, but we did n't have a tail in the sea then did you?
fish do n't have.
possibly.
mm.
well is n't, you do n't know much of.
yeah.
mm, mm.
yeah I know that.
Yes, but plants evolved with men's, man's.
I do n't know, probably several hundred million years mm, ca n't really understand them can you?
mm, did you take that tape out in the other room?
oh did you know.
do you know where it is because it i n't in this.
oh I see.
well I know, well you want to label it so you know what's on it just reminding you, you say, oh you'll say you did n't remind me to write it down.

and yet, yet, the children went to chapel.
come.
well probably Madge, Madge sort of.
in a church school, yes.
mm.
mm end of term.
well I expect if it was a church school they had to put in appearance odd times.
No Madge, Madge must of sent the children to chapel.
I do n't think Tom probably approved, but she well actually when they used to come to us on Sunday I used to take them to er, to Belver Fall me and David, Thelma's husband and he's er, his father was a superintendent so, do you want any tea?

I mean to eat, what can I have nice?
oh I do n't know, I've put the coffee on.
mm.
I want to see er, Glenda Jackson later on.
I like her.
who says she's square face?
she's not.
not er not Glenda Jackson, Judy Dench, Geoffrey Palmer.
no, no they're, they're nice, good actress is that on about eight thirty five, so that's er not too bad.
Now do n't I've got to go and get that coffee else it'll be boiling over.
what do you mean tape thirty five?
that's I said its at eight thirty five.
See if its sweet enough, I'm not putting much sugar in and I ca n't carry both in, I dare n't carry any thing in with me left arm yet.
Well put it down on the table for a minute then.
Will you sort out er what pull overs you want washing tomorrow.
well I do n't know, there seems to be about four or five.
about, so I'm sure some of them might want washing.
it is with me spin dryer.
I mean nothing gets dry outside this time of year oh there's not much taste in this coffee is there?, do you think so?
yeah the ol.
bland is the word you're looking for.
oh that Dutch coffee was too strong, now this seems to weak, or I did n't put enough in I think I'll clean, put that filter stuff in tomorrow.
might make it better.
no, no its kept I thought it might when you put the Christmas tree on it.
I mean the only er, look, make look flimsy do n't they?
those old tables in the Antique's Roadshow.
almost worth ten thousand pounds.
and yet underneath was all.
you did n't see it.
no, sort of rusty nails not.
screws, but its.
well, I do n't know I think some value seem a bit high.
do you want a chocolate biscuit with that?
I've not had any cake tonight.

What I always do on a Monday.
washing and ironing and cooking and cleaning.
ooh you get rowed too quickly you do.
I'm not a fool.
its you who, who gets all up tight.
yes you did.
well you get all aerated then, if things are not quite right, you ai n't got much patience with some things.
no you do n't.
you just dream a lot.
no I do n't I know I'm not very mechanically minded, but.
I can fathom things out eventually.
mm, you never listen to people and then you think you can just pick it up by deduction.
instead of just obeying instructions you just say well that should go that way and that should go that way and to me that's immaterial if you just see it going, see it, if its working that's it, know where the tops and bottoms of it all I mean I see.
she, she was, no, I do n't see why they had her on last night, terrible I mean I could n't even tell what.
that song, she or tune she was supposed to be singing.
phew.
where who sang?,.
Al Jolsen with the boy?
yes er, as boy.
well he was a boy.
yes.
mm, mm.
well they must of had a profe really good whistling must n't they but why they brought her on last night I think she was hopeless.
That man with that ten thousand table, apparently he said he use it nearly every day.
he, it opened out.
into a beautiful card table and, with the pockets.
and er he said he used it every day he said oh er, now I know the value I shall have to tell my bridge pals.
not to put there glasses.
then he said I shall have to tell my bridge pals not to mark the.
because you know in the corners there were wood.
wood, inlay wood things, you did n't see it, to put the glasses on or cups of coffee, he said I'll have to tell them not to put the glasses or cups on there.
do you remember when you thought you'd got wood worm in our new table.
they were pattern holes were n't they?
mm.
and you thought that was them.
you, you get to annoyed over trivial things, so I do n't suppose you'll change at your age.
drink that coffee, its gone cold.
mind its not in the saucer you'll spill that down you.
mm.
yeah oh yeah I see what you mean.
yeah.
well it was n't in those days that were a good programme on, on Court today was n't it?
no we would n't have it on today, we'll have it on tomorrow, see how it sounds.

oh, er, well it, well that was, but I mean that's not gone back right has it?
you think it has, look you see there that's straight.
I know, I told him that was the only part that was hurting and he looked at it and said did n't.

no.
I suppose it will come right in the end its taken a long while because look at that lump there.
look, can you see?

you think too much.
cos your drum of it instructor told you.
years ago.
I said you think.
no he was right that's what I say you thinking about that thing, this is n't just doing it as it said, you ponder.
no, on, on why should we be doing this way or that way instead of.

no we did n't.
no.
yes, I'm not too bad, no.

well you just catch these things, no she did n't got to Madge's when they got the.
not to Cath, no he went in the porch, he'd only go in the porch to Audrey and tell Audrey not to go in.
because Audrey cut his things easily, the cabinet went.
no, its just in the air, I mean, if its going around you do n't want to catch it, you catch it not going out any where, and the milkman probably, yeah.
he'd of liked the horse racing on T V.
and the car to take him around, well though he liked to walk in a way, when he was younger any way.
Yes he did.

oh some of them are now.
well I dunno, they ought to be even more now that fighting, er supposedly fighting for business.
well, they would n't be making curtains, I do n't think they could.

Anyway Tim's paying a lot towards that house.
You know he paid for it to be.
Well.

And then the double glazing cost over a thousand.
Well it is about, about a thousand for one bay window so she's had the whole house done so it's probably nearer three.
No.
Well where lots of people.
Mm.
There are lots of people let the windows go and it was a case of either having new wood windows.
or, or paying the bit extra and have it double glazed.
Well you can with double glazing, some.
but you can have vents.
But while our wood frames are in condition.
Well you get it done on the insurance, your insurance covers that.
Well of course it would be.
If you get it done on the insurance I do n't suppose people worry.
Anyway it's always er they're tougher than ordinary glass anyway, even if footballs do.
Well stones or whatever.

So when I went to shut that gate after that.
No they do n't, they just die then.
Well it's where I've.

Wh when I went to shut the gate after that man had left it open I er I went round and dead-headed them all.
And leave your gate open.
Plants.
Hmm.
Well it's the people they employ, probably, not the people who are who er.
want the business.
They probably have n't got any.
I mean really when you look round here most people have taken the gates off have n't they?
Well they do it because they're lazy.
They want to put their car, put, they want to drive.
straight in with their cars.
Is that somebody's alarm ringing?
It's a bit wet is n't it?
No it's a bell.
You listen, you go to the front and listen.

Put their lights on early.
No they keep open till eight.
You go to the front door.
You go to the front door but it's probably next door but one the alarm went, go to the front door.

When will you start painting?
Oh I do feel weary, I hope I'm not going to have the flu.
I told you that.
I felt weary this afternoon.
No it is n't!
I had a bad night last night.
Countdown was quite good today.
Arthur?
Er Carole Vorderman, she's not getting a chance to do the figures.
I, I think everybody's catching up to her methods like I am.
So she got two, two words better than.
either the contestants or the er dictionary judges.
So she scored on that line.
I think we'll look at the news in a few minutes to see what the weather's going to be and then, do you want any ice cream or anything?
Or a drink?
Just get a, are you ready for an ice cream or later?
Later?
What about holidays?
Yes but this time we usually book that April holiday about January.
I know but in April you've got to take a chance.
I could do with one now I think.
Are you coming to look at the news?
We saw that Jack the Ripper did n't we?
Yes it was on Sky last year.
So the only thing.
No.
So the only thing er we're interested in is in er Some Mothers Do Have Them, seven thirty.
And the Falklands on Four.
Ooh I do n't want to see that thing.
Animals, yes.
Is it?
Falklands is at nine.
oh Wildlife on One.
I do n't like to see those er mink.
I know but erm.
I should n't, not these days.
I rather think that's a, a repeat, I seem to re remember seeing it because er did n't a lot of them escape and they've.
sort of bred all over the country?
Well I'll perhaps go and have a bath then.
Have you had a shave yet?
You know what Mr said.
When you're retired, shave every day.
So it looks as though we'll be able to go shopping tomorrow by the weather forecast.
Okay?
And we'll take the marmalade.
Are you going to take that to Madge's and show.
the picture.
But remind me.
Oh yes.
No remind me to get some jars.
Yes, I do n't think she looks nice like that.
Oh she's a lot thinner but She's smoking to get thin.
I think that's what Cathy used to do cos she used to get tubby, has n't she?
And then she'd suddenly go thinner and I'm sure it was when she started smoking again.
Have you looked in the garage for your slippers?
Well are you ready for your ice cream now?
Are you ready for ice cream yet?
I do n't want to get rid of it!
Yes.
Get it over with.
Do n't think I feel like anything to eat after that late lunch.
But I thought you'd read that paper this morning?
Well where's your glasses?
Mm?
You ought to wear them you know.
Did you s see the end of the news?
Er a stronger virus er.
for flu has been found and they.
think it might lead to a, an epidemic, mm.
No this is a stronger strain apparently and er they're a bit worried.
I do n't think I've ever had the real flu.
I think you did years ago, that time, the only once you had the doctor.
Mm.
Yeah.
Ma Madge said she had the real flu because she ached all over and really weak.
But I've never had it like that, it's, touch wood I never do.
I've not seen Les today, have you?
I wonder how he.
I dunno, what you want poached egg or egg and bacon?
and tomato, now drink that because I do n't think we shall be able to go out today with the frost and the fog, the, you've got that on your chest and I've got a hurt throat.
well finish this off.
finish that, finish that off what, have this.
I need to be.
well it, well it'll have to be our voices again on this because things being what they are we ca n't er, we ca n't go out to Cath's today with your cold and my bad throat.
in the fog and frost so, perhaps they just be content with our voices.
Friday.
and you could n't see.
well I know it says from the Midlands freezing fog, so were not going out in it so I can.
we can have a steam meat pudding today, cos I'll have to leave that on.
oh you will after that, that, later.
mm.
well his dustbin was n't there cos the little lad took it in yesterday.
perhaps he was just admiring his new car.
unless he was looking around and see if it had been bumped in the night.
did n't he?, perhaps he's going to take his wife to work.
perhaps waiting for all the kids to school first perhaps ca n't see to do it in the dark.
do n't seem a very good driver does he? now, are you going to do any painting this morning?
no, all I want you to do if you're up to it, is get me cooker hood thing off, so I can clean it, it's not been cleaned since before Christmas.
just the, so we can put the new filter in, only they fret wants cleaning, I can do that, if you'll get up and undo it for me.
go where?, huh I, I had an awful night again, I did n't get to sleep till about one or two, I'm not going to go to bed early again.
mm?
I do n't know, you were up at six, just after.
Just that shoulder still hurt? keep rubbing it.
no, you get obsessed with that.
mm.
do you want some marmalade?
I've got some more toast in the kitchen, I'll fetch it in Have you put the fire down?
I was going to say it was a bit light you do n't want to get too hot.
mm.
mm What do you want for a sweet?
I've got mince pies.
bananas and custard those, those bananas are going a bit.
well I like them when they go soft.
now are you having marmalade, I'm going to fetch it now.
it's not sticky and if you get it all over you shows how cold it must of been in the night, the butter wo n't spread.
well it usually keeps quite soft on, that kitchen table, near the boiler where d'ya want them?, sit up.
I think this time of the year the mornings seem to get darker.
could be.
no, I do n't think so, well I think if I feel like it, after I've done me cooker hood, I might do a bit of baking.
make a pudding, no I think I'll make some little, I've got some oat meal and you do n't like the porridge from it so I'll make some little.
oat meal and treacle crunchies, you like those do n't you?
I did n't have.
porridge and I.
well that was the milk.
it was the cream of the milk, well you used to like it, well sort of, some people make it with water, that's why I made it all milk, are you going to try it again with water? and just a drop of milk on top.
well that's er, er sort of oat meal, porridge, why I use it to make some oat meal crunchies.
well I've given it to the birds in the past when I've had.
nothing else.
did n't they eat it?
well you ca n't give the birds much bread today, because I have n't got a white loaf, I'm not going to give'em this expensive whole meal bread.
yes, but it's not his day to bring bread.
I'm not paying that price, he charges about twice as much, it's seventy nine P.
in the shops it's about forty five.
no you're not going, look I thought you said you've got it on your chest?
well you did n't put your coat on the other day when you went for the paper.
and that's where you've got this cold from.
yes, and look what you've done for yourself now.
well you would n't be in the garden would you without a coat or a, wind sheeter on, it's silly.
why? well you've got to conserve your strength at your age.
yes.
oh, I've not done it yet this morning.
I'm gon na have to have some honey for my throat, honey and lemon I think I've got a big wide hoarser on me back.
looked in the mirror, it looked as though it was.
yes, no, on, on the back of me throat.
oh.
ah, I've just got to do some cooking, bit of cleaning.
I do n't know, I've not looked at the programmes, there's Churchill tonight at nine thirty, must look at that.
oh, any body in high position you always have critics and have to be a bit ruthless at times, I expect.
Have you wound that clock up?, it looks a bit slow to me compared with the others.
it is going, it wants winding up, I can tell.
do you want another cup of tea?
you do n't put enough tea in, milk in my tea first thing in the morning is that right?
no I never say there's too much milk.
I'm going to have another cup.
Have you had any whisky in your tea yet? whisky in.
well you've just heard the forecast, if it's freezing fog, were not going out.
it's Wednesday today all day I thought you were going to get on with your painting?
see what's on this afternoon, I sha n't look up any thing this morning, unless there's a cookery programme on we both did a lemon.
the both I T V and B B C, both did a lemon pudding yesterday, about the same, I might make one one day, it was easy recipe, new one.
I'm not very interested in that and in any case I would n't be able to look at it, I'll be getting the dinner.
I thought you said Oaklahoma was on yesterday, are you looking at the right page?
it's Wednesday today.
I did n't I said Wednesday you're always getting the wrong programmes.

well they're looking a bit dull.
no, it's too cold for you to go in the garage, do n't want to get pneumonia do ya?
no.
no, I never cared for them put your glasses on instead of squinting.

no it is n't.
oh it's not my type mm Penny's having to wait a long while for her birthday is n't she?,.
I thought Cath might of come round, but.
well she know's I've got b, Penny's birthday present here.
and as we have n't been able to get round.
no do n't mind, it's unlikely what, she wo n't want to come out in weather like this, oh she, she.
yes Agatha Christies.
well that, that's a spoof on it, it's not.
it's not the real Agatha Christie but that's a bit dated I think now.
what's that?
phew do what.
oh you are horrible.
who's in it?
oh well well we do n't want.
that, I do n't like that language.
oh, no, not for me.
well that's probably five to one in the morning then.
mm, does n't sound all that good does it?
well that's that er mm he was in Mary Poppins.
yes Bewitched, Bewitched is the programme he's normally in.
or was in, I do n't know and did n't the male er, lead? dunno how you can read that without glasses, I ca n't.
he was in Mary Poppins and.
I think you said it was on channel four that will be, in the morning if you look at, look at channel four programme and get your glasses cos if you miss it Monday night you said you could have it.
no, course it would n't, P M's afternoon, you know that.

no I do n't like Arabian Nights.
well, no, yes well that's only morning, that's morning after midnight.
well you, oh no, well you can I'm going in the kitchen.

or, or you going to have some honey and whisky and lemon?
well how's your chest?, does it still fell raw?
oh, what you going to try some of this or wait for your whisky and lemon?
It's a murky day again.
That cooker hood was filthy, must of been all the Christmas shopping cooking I mean I think I'll put the new filter on, I'll have a go any way.
eh?
Jackie said these cooker hoods are not.
well they're alright, but I mean you can tell they take the grease out of the kitchen, but, they're a bit of a bind are n't they? of all the cleaning and I mean I do n't see why the people who make them do n't sell the blimming proper filter to filter themselves instead we do n't have.
I mean where you buy the, the thing from you'd think the seldom, the spares as you want them about every four months.
yeah that's not right is it?, in fact I wrote to them and last year and er give me a Birmingham address, they might, oh.
mm, are you going to drink that?
is it complete now?
right I'll get your coffee, no I'll get your honey and whisky.
I'm waiting for the hot water, mm.
oh.
brains, brains.
no.
oh oh, remind me at half past eleven, flap jacks will be done, do n't forget, I've hurt my leg now.
After all that trauma I think I deserve this do you?
I think so, just about, now put those slippers on Arthur, you've got a cold coming now you drink it while it's hot, that's a good lad oh I've put the pudding on now, so it'll have to steam for about two hours at least two and a half.
so it'll give you a bit of time to do your painting now wo n't it?
mm I be, oh you ai n't rubbed out, I thought you'd rubbed out what you did yesterday.
oh, huh.
it's right.
size, that make it easier?
I do n't know.
mm.
it's the first thing kids do, draw, when.
when they're at school.
I can, I can remember the first drawing, you used to draw a house and you.
no.
mm.
You do n't want any thing to eat with it do ya?
Arthur.
what was I going to say? forget now.
yes I know, I was just going to say ca n't think.
yes well do you want any thing to eat with that drink?
well I'm still cooking are n't I?
tis er, I can see why Joan's.
not, no I can see why she do n't like to cook all that much it's a dirty job really.
well makes your kitchen messy does n't it?
no, I, I mean these flap jacks I'm making.
and she just likes every thing just spick and span, all in the right place.
Stop rubbing that eye now wear your glasses.
well, well that's a silly thing you should if, if you're grinding you should wear your, some specs.
even old one's to keep the dust out of your eyes my throat still feels raw, how's your chest then.
no I do n't.
mm, hurting across your chest, pain gone?
mm.
I've got catarrh, in fact I had to get up in the night and put some there.
no you were fast asleep in about two.
I thought I was waking you when I was tossing about.
I dunno, I.
you must of been dead to the world, what with working.
no.
no.
I'd better go and turn that gas down.
yeah.
do n't forget, remind me at half past eleven those flap jacks.
yes.
well where's your picture?
oh I see is that the paper we bought from that shop?
fancy forgetting to get that card yesterday.
well if you'd of put it at the top of the basket, I would of seen it.
and remembered, I mean when we went to the, get the meat, we were near the shop, we'd only just got to go down.
Carts Lane.
I'll leave you to fathom that out I know you do n't like me in the room when your fathomering things out.
you see, you see you're sneezing again been in that cold garage, I told you, did you have the fire on?
now put those slippers on, that, if you get your feet cold that gives you put those slippers on.
just brought us a free sample of that erm freeze dried instant tea.
well, oh you're supposed to have four cups I'll er I'll use it one day and not tell you and see if you can tell the difference shall I?
Those bricks of.
seemed to be holding them from better place from the springs we could n't find are n't they?
you know I used to sort of bellow out.
oh it's alright, er I thought this was a nice bottle, but it's a foil bag, look.
that's it, they say in, you know what they've done, they've left the gate wide open again.
I'll have, I'll have to go out and shut it.
yes another cleaning offer, half price should we have these carpets cleaned?
yes.
oh another offer, hand cream, Neutragone, Neutragena do n't give you much as a sample, oh highly concentrated.
two to three applications.
on the railings look.
I do n't know how you can see with that curtains pulled like that, why's it, shall I pull it back?
what's the mat, look I've just trod on two grapes there.
that's why I say we want the carpets cleaning.
That's it you can spitting your grape pips on the top if I'd er been, I've picked up.
oh yes that's a good excuse is it alright?
your paint a graph, is it working?
or have n't you finished it off yet.
mm, like every thing else you told me you'd finished it the other day.
mm.
use your glasses, do you want another drink?
no you're not having too much.
well, I do n't know whether that man over there is cleaning the windows or whether he's having to look at the double glazing again.
well, he was there yesterday, apparently he's must have a complaint on the double glazing would n't be cleaning windows two days would he?
do you want it hot or, or with dry ginger?
oh you can have it hot.
well I'll give you dry ginger this time.
Flap jacks do n't appear to be cooked and yet they've been in the time they should have, I do n't know what's happened, there you are there's your drink do n't knock it over.
put it that side.
so where is your.
I thought you always kept it in here oh.
mm?
it says leave it for ten minutes so I expect it er hardens now.
Would you sooner of had a pie?
not really, always have more gravy, did n't, I did n't think the meat was as good, you did n't either and I went to another butcher because I thought it.
no you did n't, shin of beef is like that, but.
do n't be silly, no I thought it looked better at this other bit, this butcher's, it looked leaner, but erm it was n't perhaps, perhaps I did n't cook it enough yesterday, drink your drink.
but I've got some left of that beef, so.
I'm not going to throw it away, it's too expensive to throw away, no I'll cook it a bit more and do a do a curry, rice or spaghetti.
why should I take it to Cath's?
that was when I burnt my arm.
I'm gon na put me feet up for a few minutes, do you want now we've nearly finished?
I say I'll put me feet up before we wash up.
no you need n't.
yes, twenty four pigeons it's too many.
no no the starlings seem to be pecking away at the top slabs are getting dry so I do n't know, er you see that man's still up there, I wonder what he's doing up there at the side.
well he would n't, do n't take all that long to put guttering up does it? unless he's pointing the bricks up, he was there all day yesterday.
oh I see what you mean.
oh I, yeah.
are you going to do any drawing or painting?, are you fed up with it?
rest.
yes.
mm.
oh that's why you bought the big board.
you know where your drawing pins are?
look there's the drawing pins.
out, in this cupboard?
I should like something nice to finish off with.
do n't be silly.
no.
do you want half this orange?
cos the big ones are too big, big are n't they these are.
I've only just put it on.
no they're Morroc but they're.
but they're a bigger size and thicker skinned, I'd sooner have the smaller ones.
you do sometimes these are the best Morroc's, but, same, the stall I go to does n't stand on Tuesdays only Wednesdays and Fridays and Saturdays, here are.
I sha n't get juice all over every where, it'll be you.
Well Made your Barbara's on at two o'clock, are you going to see that?
you've got to be quick though.
it's nearly that now, are you going to change.
mm?, you better, they're your old trousers are n't they?,.
I mean.
look at all the pigeons again do you want to have a bit more?, nice are n't they?, sit up, sit up these are juicy are n't they? must still be very cold outside, can you see the steam from the boiler?
I'm glad we've got the cooker hood done, you can see all that black.
ca n't never that filter to be like that have you?
well those hack saw blades do, do n't they?
I mean I think so.
I think those springs are, are dangerous, they shoot up and down on.
mm.
I mean.
that's what I mean, as you were putting it in it, it shot out did n't it?
last time.
Not much on these potatoes.
I've not had any today, just had one little bit, do, do you like'em?
would it?
well your the expert.
well that, that spring you got was too thick.
too wide, was n't it?, it was wider than the, the thing itself, so you want, it's got to be cut down width wise.
ah but on, you know the new diagram, the new packet, the springs went like dia er.
half a diamond shape.
and on one side and yet inside the instructions it gave, you know.
two curves.
well we paid about three pounds for those springs.
mm.
when we bought them, when we had the first lot of springs.
you must have, must be in me diary.
yes, that would.
mm.
mm.
mm, I know.
mm.
mm.
where you going to get the spring from?
mm.
Is this too hot with the fire on?
is that the boiler making that noise?
seems to be louder than usual, do n't it?
I thought I'd turn the fan on.
I know I thought I'd turned it off, I'm going to have a look, something seems to be making a noise it was the vent.
I'd put that on as well as the other fan.
what on the.
mm.
nearly five too, five too.
stop moaning, you know what you did n't have.
your medicine before your meal, that medicine you're supposed to take before for your chest.
no I think that it's to get the vocabulary various classes of people and varies age group.
they're the things that's got to fit in, no they're not.
do n't know.
here you are lets take these.
mind that might be hot.
do n't put it on the carpet if it's hot.
no that.
do n't want sewing up?
do n't stand on it.
mind, your going to spray.
lets move it away.
oh we've got one of them, light bulbs.
to be replaced, look one of'ems gone, that's why it's dark.
Better find a little dish to put them on so you do n't wa.
loose them, let me get a dish.
what are ours?
well you do n't, you do n't have to make it in plastic do you?
oh.
mm.
the body.
yeah.
what.
mm, have you had it a few years?
mm.
mm.
oh, oh it's.
my tubes have gone, one out of each pack oh I see you've got one, one er, er out of each room.
I just remembered one of these lights went last night.
I forgot to remind Arthur to er.
to replace it.
get that one down.
do n't draw on that table too much, you'll mark the table.
put that other lamp on Arthur.
so you can see.
is Eadie resting?
mm, I always eat plenty of fruit.
Arthur does grapes.
mm, he loves grapes and apples.
we could n't bring any apples though yesterday, not taking me car with.
we get er.
well it's, it's still swollen.
but, er I can turn taps and hold things a little bit more.
not, not all that.
as you, you know how you sort of hold want to.
hold things in your left hand.
er, it's still not very strong.
no.
but the swellings gone down mostly I've got gloves.
on for the first time yesterday.
so.
I think I'll go.
you do n't have to draw it in yellow.
but you've got different colour pencils.
do n't suppose you adjust it very often do ya?
no.
mm, yeah.
mm.
mm oh I see.
oh Arthur's all, always messing about with ours.
to sort of make them go round.
you know unless there's a draft.
they wo n't always flicker do they?
he likes fiddling about.
well he's only got on, there's one out of each fire.
well so has Les got two.
but there's one alright and one broken.
yeah of course, yeah.
he's got two fires.
he, he fiddles about with he likes fiddling.
yes.
or graphite.
yes you want one of them.
it'll be easier.
mm.
no make two in metal instead.
oh I know your five minutes Arthur, five hours.
usually always.
I thought you were feeding'em when.
just before you went upstairs for a bath.
you were cos I when Les came I thought you were still feeding them.
have you seen the records Les is, oh he's going to feed the birds before seven.
mm.
well he's busy taping nearly all, our old records.
well they're easier to put in the tapes.
are.
you, you have n't got a tape machine?
no.
well we only bought ours last year.
but as were getting older we find.
put a tape in ea without any trouble I ca n't.
I ca n't see to put the needle on properly on the record.
Arthur says I scratch them any way.
trying to put it on so.
so I never bothered with the records.
but with a tape.
just slot them in.
and that's it.
in fact if I'd known you had n't got one, the one we had before, oh know it's not got a tape on though, but you've got a record player have n't you? yes.
right, I mean the record player that we've got and radio was quite good.
but it had n't got the tape.
thing.
and we gave it to the erm school at over Downing Drive.
for, when they were having their sale for their sports and swimming pool or something.
I mean we had given to us our friends, mad on radios.
and er, you know, he always wanted the very latest and.
when he got some money.
he, he decided to have erm video and every thing and cassette.
music centre.
so erm, he said would you like it.
instead of your old record player.
so, er we had it for about four years and then Arthur decide to have one of these last year.
It's funny about Ellis having ya, I think, I think.
the re-unions though would n't be the pre-war would they?
yes but for what year?
oh it was of your age though.
oh, oh.
oh.
because not many of the.
no played.
hockey but was never in a team, no.
you were in a football team?
oh yes, oh I know Dora she used to be in our dancing troop.
we had a little dancing troop.
yes, yes Dora.
well that was before she, well, was she?,.
I did n't know that.
cos she was a bit young, she was more like my young sister age.
I've got a picture of her somewhere.
will you pull the curtain?
yeah.
no, do you remember that photograph we've got of that dancing troop?
yes.
and Cath, well apparently he knows one of the girls on.
do you know where it is?
Dora.
in fact her brother er came to work at Oliver's, er, er.
in the buying office, er when I was there.
but he did n't stay long.
I do n't know why.
Buller Road, yes.
McDonald.
Dun Donald.
yes.
next to it.
before, before Buller.
Robert's Road at the top.
and I was at the bottom.
yeah, yes and er she, but she was a bit younger than me she was more my young sister's age, two years younger than me.
yeah.
mm.
so she'll be two or three years younger.
because I think this little dancing troop we had out, I was about the eldest.
there was my young sister we used to perform at.
concerts.
Carey Hall and er.
and er Melbourne we used to go.
that one at Melbourne Road.
oh that is n't eh that's Dora fancy you knowing her.
that's Dora, that's me.
I forget what her name is.
oh that's Do that's Betty that's her young sister.
and that's my young sister Cath.

I'm trying to think of her name oh that was my young sister's.
that was my young sister's mother, Wendy.
in the war nineteen forty.
no forty one.
she's dead now though she's.
that's not high brow.
have we got erm.
nice band man, there that's me, that's me mam, that's.
me dad and that, they're both dead now.
and er they're all dead now.

So I made you, I'd got.
some other beef.
What's that like?
That's alright is it?
Eh!
Guess who rang while you were out in.
the garden?
George.
I said, oh, we were only talking about you yesterday.

he's back from Catherine's.
I sa I said erm well, how about coming for lunch one day?
Oh!
He said, yes, I will do.
He said erm I ca, I ca n't make arrangements much in advance because I never know how I'm feeling.

And then went and it was all overgrown.
And then the next time, a few years later he'd got it back.

Wi with ringing me.

apparently, a friendship meeting or something, for elderly people in the village.
And he was giving a lady across the road a lift there.
So cos apparently, while he was on the phone she came knocking at the door then.
and he said, well wait a minute while I answer the door.
And er he apparently told her to sit in the car while he finished his.
conversation with me on the phone.
You were in the garden so I could n't.
fetch you.

No!
No.
It was about fours years.
Well Kath was a very.
