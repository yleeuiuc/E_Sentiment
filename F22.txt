But Claire said they kept coming up to her and saying what are you erm what do you stand as being county for?
And things like this you see!

No.
Well apparently she said stands her in good stead because.
the motorway!
And then, her interview was one o'clock she did n't go in till quarter to three!
And Derek was sat waiting all that time, but they must have panicked then so they erm we'll have to wait and see.

Oh!
Mm.
I should keep some off the floor, I think it should be in.
And also, you do n't get dust and dirt, if they're on the floor it seems to gather on the floor.
but if you hang them up I think it's better.
But I think you can, you can get them all in the cupboard now.
You get th.
Yeah.
Then you'll be able to put your ironing board in there.
And then.
Oh that's good then is n't it?

Cos they queue in our bread shop.
They're queuing there.
That is now, I do n't think it does so well.
Cos Betty's used to be in Kwicksave.
And they used to do very well in there.
And then when they went over to the other side of the road which I do n't walk on very often.
erm I do n't think they do so well.
And in, Claire always says there's th, there's a la, dogs sniff around the back of there all the time.

So she says, she always says to me do n't buy erm.

to help out.
Well I do n't think, I, they did n't have much in the window, I could n't see very much cos there was n't a light on.
Mm.
Yes the er builder's broken her bath.
he dropped a tile in there.
Mm.
But he's managed to get another one.
Mm.
To go round the er, to to match, I suppose it's the same, I do n't know.
She says she's fed up with having them there.
Yeah.
It's been ti, it's been tiled as well.
Mm.
Dropped a tile and it pierced it right the way through.
Mm.
Well she said it was same bath did n't she?
She wanted me to go and have a look at it with that still in there.
And then she's going home today.

I went out the room!
Do n't know.
Yes, but pretends he's not watching and he looks over the top of his paper.
Oh it's stupid!
I mean if anybody else just got up on the stage like he does and kicks his leg, kick like their leg like er like that they'd boo him off!
What's funny about it?
Well you did n't think it was funny when we went to see.
A.
Amanda laughed at them did n't.
she?
What did he do that wig on his head for?
Judge who?
Pickles?
Oh.
Judge who?
Oh.
Has that been on before?
What was that in there?
You're a little devil you are!
Where did that come from?
That thing.
Oh!
No you got ta butter it again now.
How, how can you call that talent when he's just, does that with his leg and then kicks.
his foot around?
What's talent in that?
Well eight o'clock it starts.
But we'll go out, oh look at that little bird!
He's gon na go down on those nuts now.
And we'll go out and pick up aunty Jean about twenty to eight.
Oh I do n't know if it'll be very good, but it, what's it called?
Sex and.
No sex or something?
I do n't think dad'll like it, I do n't know why he's going.
Well you did n't like the last one we went to did you?
Well why could n't you say.
It's probably because I was getting looked at by erm a ginger haired boy.
Dad said erm that play was ever so awful!
Yeah.
When I asked him, he said, oh it was nothing different.
Well she never said if she did she?
When's she?
No she's going in December.
That's if se that girl wanted to go.
Well there's tre, oh they've got signs outside or not?
, da is it golf or.
Is that one going?
They did n't stay there long did they?
Yeah, erm, yeah.
They might have or.
Mm.
Well it could be.
Urgh!
Claire!
Take him off your clothes!
Urgh!
I took her outside this morning and she is the typical scaredy cat she is!
The the.
that's right when that big ginger tom was there and I, you should have seen her!
She's peeping round the corner of the stones, that step down there!
Well she's su such a scaredy cat!
I think she needs erm.
fleeing er Claire because she keeps scratching all the time.
Claire.
You got the flea powder?
Well,.
And she do n't like Whiskas!
That's the most expensive cat food!
Oh she do n't know whether to come and have food or go upstairs with you.
I wish I could get this horrible pest that's doing my ironing!
Look!
There's all like little black things!
Claire.
Look at this!
Look!
Two colours!
Well look at it!
Well I think it must be.
Well it's bound to be is n't it?
Yeah, but I know he did n't mean to do that.
A yellow and a pink one up in the same plant.
That's their colour.
I'll have to get something to erm.
get rid of it, the black spider things, I do n't know what they are.
Oh are you?
Well take mine cos I do n't.
want it.
I do n't, I'm not using it.
I'm.
just waiting for aunty Jean.
Alright then.
Bye!
So do n't be too late.
because erm.
You'll give me a ring if you're gon na be in for tea?
Yep.
Yeah?
How's Pam, alright?
Fed up?
No.
No.
It's a bit annoying.
I think they should have tried to the bathroom myself.
Should have done.
Are they?
I did n't know why they have n't done it before.
Why have they.
Why is it difficult?
Cos it's money involved.
Yeah, well I think they could have done it a bit quicker do n't you?
I think they could have done.
I think er, and Pam says there's a sort of post sticking up in the ceiling or something?
I think Derek says he's sa, it's a, it's a erm tt, temporary thing.
But she says she's made a.
hole in this, this the, they've put it in.
Well she said she do n't want it going up the middle there.
Why not?
But did she know that before?
Well.
Oh right.
Oh!
You'd think they'd like that.
No.
Oh.
Well I think, I would have thought they could have done it a bit quicker, the bathroom, if they wanted to.
And it's a bit difficult for her is n't it?
Especially.
with your mother.
It's a bit difficult I think.
Yeah.
Are they gon na do it?
Are they, what are they going to have today, plasterers?
No, Monday they're coming are n't they?
They were supposed to be here last week.
I was.
Oh!
Well they're a bit over the, their stated time are n't they?
Stipulated.
You wo n't have to pay them anything soon, cos you wo you keep knocking it off you wo n't have to pay anybody will you?
Yeah.
Too.
many.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well then Pam made me laugh cos the tiler he, she said he's go up on the roof and he's there for hours!
Mm.
Sort of, and then once he comes down he's hardly done anything has he?
Just sits up there.
Has he?
You can see it from the bottom of our garden.
you know, you can see your new roof coming out.
Has he?
Oh!
That's alright then.
Suppose it's a bit, I should think I think last night she was absolutely fed up Pam was!

No, but you're just you're handy are n't you?
She's got ta have a go at something has n't she?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I but do n't forget she's got your mother as well and I think you ca n't.
you ca n't be normal can you really.
when erm.
erm I could n't have looked after my mum.
I mean, I did it for four months and then I could n't do any more, I just think I mean, I know Amanda and Claire were a lot younger then and I think it's difficult when they are they're younger.
But I mean, she's a dear old soul but I have n't got her round me all the time.
And I think i it's her not being able to hear you as well, it's awful is n't it?
It is hard work is n't it?
And Cla, Claire was laughing at me yesterday, she said, you do n't have to shout at her!
I said, well if I do n't talk loudly she does n't hear what you're saying.
Has she?
Yeah.
She I think you can see on her face though sometimes John, that she has n't understood.
what you've said.
It sort of registers on her face.
But then I think if you get one side of her she hears you better.
I dunno.
But she says that she's years ago she used to put an onion in her ear or something.
When she's.
She has n't still got it in her ear has she?
Has n't got it.
Yeah.
She says it's stuck.
Yeah.
Oh what's that supposed.
Does it?
Truly?
Or is just a.
Are you?
Oh.
But she said I, sort of, she said puts, puts something in here ear it.
Your pop the, yeah, you can.
pop your ears ca n't you?
Oh!
Oh well.
Anyway, you've had a week off.
Resting.
What did you.
what did you do then?
You got your greenhouse Pam said.
Where you gon na put it?
It's down where the rest of goes down int it?
Plants, not, I keep calling it.
I said to him, they got enough junk up there now and you have to go and.
add to it!
Yeah.
It came from erm.
a flat.
Yeah, they had erm a balcony and er, so then they did n't want it there any more so he took it off.
And I said, well they've got enough stuff up there!
Amanda says oh well John wanted it!
And wo n't he hit his head hard if he gets into it.
But it's stuck in.
Yeah but it's stuck in.
Because I think I would have thought he'd stop doing that now, but Pam said he still runs down the bottom of the garden.
Said he wobbles does n't he?
Do you think he'll be any better?
Tha than he is now?
But.
Cos he wobbles does n't he?
And he sort of I dunno he si when he picks his paw up sometimes it's all erm, limp is n't it?
Where he ca n't.
Will he get any feeling back in those do you think?
No, I did n't think he'd get that better.
I thought you'd have to have him put down.
I did n't honestly think he'd get any better.
Especially when I first saw him sort of, crawling on his tummy and not wanting any food and I thought, ah!
I do n't think he's gon na get any better.
He surprised me actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really surprised me!
Because I did n't think he'd have the erm what's the word I want?
To get up and go again, I think he sort of, I thought he was just gon na lay there.
Yeah.
Yeah, but he's, he's, he ca n't keep doing that can he?
Cos I mean if he keeps rushing down there and you got the greenhouse there he's gon na go through that!
You ca n't go through!
He wo n't be er, but she was so she said you're gon na chop the tree down, that tree whe, that he bumped into!
But I think he wo n't do that again.
Will he?
He's excitable is n't he?
He's sort of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I mean, you see.
It's a bit like a boxer dog because Derek's sis sister had a boxer dog and he used to we used to walk along country lanes and then he'd pi, he used to see something he used to go straight through the hedge!
No one's.
in the way!
and all sorts!
I thought stupid animal!
Yeah.
Daft!
Oh!
He'll have all fleas all over him!
Yeah.
Da, have you seen the fox in your garden?
They.
they, yeah we've got one, we've one going through our garden, he's limping now I do n't know what's wrong with him.
He's so got something wrong with his back paws or something like that.
Yeah!
He sits down here and he sunbathes!
On the bottom down there.
He walks through there and he gets up on that shed at the bottom of the garden next door but one.
Yeah.
Gets up on the, on the shed.
Yeah!
I do n't like him in the garden, but Derek keeps encouraging this thing.
I said if our cat gets out all over the.
That's what he keeps doing for them.
I do n't want him to do it!
So if he does it again, he's had it!
Yeah!
That's what he does.
And yo you see our cat's always roaming around now, I said he'll get that stuck on his ears that rats has.
I do n't want him having that on.
Yeah!
Do cats get it?
Most of our garden'll be finished one day!
Yeah, he was gon na have a path all the way round.
And he's terracing the garden.
Dunno where, mind, but it erm, and he's got ta finished painting outside yet.
And then he's terracing the gar, th sh, he's gon na bring the shed out, because it's rotten, it's behind that hedge you see.
Mm.
But I do n't know if I want it brought out.
I do n't particularly look at the shed but there you are.
But you leave it there it rots.
It was my mum's shed actually, he bought it down after she died.
That's his mum's picnic table, we got all dead people's stuff!
That's his mother's plastic table she bought just before she died.
Looking at all the, at the stuff but the trouble is you've got ta find somewhere to put it all have n't you?
And our garden's not very big.
And it's alright for, your garden's bare!
What did you do?
That's what Derek says.
You see we got th er collects things down here he keeps chucking rubb, he said well I need it.
I said, but when?
Oh!
Oh!
I'll need it!
We did actually, cos he used to for all going down there.
But I suppose it'll get finished one day.
I do n't know how you manages your garden.
Too big!
Is n't it?
Yeah, but men do n't, but wo wo women at home looking out the window they do do n't they?
Oh yeah.
Yes.
Pam said you did that.
That was good was n't it?
Oh it were your mam, I think your mam told me that you'd got it out.
I bet that's made it a bit lighter has n't it, with that tree gone?
Well you got one of their trees in there and they'll cut that down and they do n't do anything about them.
The sun goes behind there.
What here?
Thought you said you were in a rush this morning?
Yeah.
I did n't realise you'd taken it.
I have n't forgotten to go shopping up.
That's why.
If I'd have got my clothes on to get.

so she, she, if it were n't, if she has him to build her own suite, she's gon na get erm Lee, what was his name Clare?
Lee.
dad cos he did a really good job to do the, the tiling and you see she had seconds tiles.
from Pilkingtons and there's little, she said you would n't notice it but there's little like, little things on and when he did the grouting yesterday she said that she said it was awful, she did n't like it at all so she told him this morning.
no did n't like how he grouted it because she said there, things like a little nick in the tile, if he'd gone in with the grouting it would n't of shown any and he did n't.
I do n't know.
and she said she, its cos she said, she said of course if its because she's so used to Joe he would of, I said yeah but he went over the top did n't he, cos he always did every thing to perfection, I said you ca n't have Joe doing it.
well he got the tiles she did n't.
yeah, but she they did n't get the one's that, she could n't get the one's that she wanted cos they did n't have enough.
well he went with her.
she said Joe would of got them all at the top where you could n't see them and things like that, I said well you wo n't get builders doing that.
have n't got time to do that.
I said to her you'll just looking for fault all the time you are I said that's.
what your doing, your just, she said I know I am she says I'm nick picking, I'm just looking for faults, I told you that today.
no but she said it look's much bigger, she's got a very big broom cupboard.

oh.
mm inexperienced are n't they, they just need, they do n't know how to get up the top, they must of only just learnt to drive look, seventeen, must n't they? that's a fast road that is n't it across there?
mm.
fast moving road I think that is.
that frog's.
still on top of the pond.
no, but I thought perhaps it was frozen so it wo n't fertilize.
yeah, but I thought the frost would of killed the, the.
no I thought the frost would of killed of the.
that's what I mean there dead are n't they.
cos it the frost it was like a lump of ice the other day.
yeah I think you might as well throw it.
they have n't been.
since its too cold.
yes, is there really?
I, I do n't think warm, so why they early?
yeah.
no.
well I said we'd pick up aunty Jean at twenty too eight.

that's cos I said to him round the other way.

I was talking to Mrs the other day, down the road, she's had, she had er back problem and she gets terrible trouble at night, sleeping.
did you?
it yaps a lot that do do n't it?
he has n't got a job has he?
oh where's he?
I did n't have a bicycle.
Well I said to Derek, look at our tiles, you see, and he said that's unfair because he said these are n't, what?
Your tiles are.
But then you do n't do that.
So you do n't do that.
Yeah.
Ah!
Upstairs.
Ah!
I think you were n't.
Oh!
Ah!
And in some places.
it was, it was.
quite.
I've seen them with the tiles.
Well we did them.
in the kitchen!

Well, that's it.
Did n't he?
So there's that, all that.
Yeah.
So th, no spaces in them?
So you'll be doing it.
by eye?

Yeah.
Well perhaps he did n't use them.
Alright.
Derek's.
got ta go.
Yeah.
Do n't wait for you for lunch?
Oh allright.
Oh alright then.
Yeah.
Well I should wait till it's actually Jean, I do n't think there's any, it's only that bit anyway, to be honest with you.
Yeah.
I think that.
I do n't think that's right if you go there.
No.
Have a look what every has got.
So which would you prefer?
Fine?
You've got them crossed now have n't you?
Yeah.
Got them crossed.
Yeah.
Got them crossed.
Mm.
Well.
Well I do n't know, I think that's quite nice across.
But I.
think probably it's because it needs painting cos it's a horrible colour is n't it?
What is it?
Er er.
A creamy colour is n't it?
Yeah.
Are you?
It's not at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was fuming when I came home!
And she's gon na get it when she comes home!
Well I ca came home, I had Derek's overalls in the the sink, they need washing on their own, and I said to Cla, so I had to go shopping this morning because Claire only worked all day yesterday so she.
could n't take me so I.
ca n't do it.
Because it hurts my back.
And erm I said to her, dad's overall's in the machine so when they're finished you hand them on the line.
Yes, okay, she said yeah.
Now in here Jean was her washing bowl full of washing soap in and her bits and pieces like tights and that.
Now, if you take something out of the machine in th, what would you do with that there?
It was just left!
I ca n't do it now!
So she's gon na get it when she comes in!
Is just put it in!

Yeah.
See machine has gone off.
I mostly do now is hers.
But I was really mad!
I was shattered today when I came home!
And then Derek home and Manda said he was shopping, and I said oh come on!
I said, it takes hours going shopping with you!
He said oh!
He said, we're not in a rush.
I said, mind they do n't eat.
That's what we were saying used to say we do.
Oh!
Go shopping, go and come back!
Mm.
Mm mm.
Yeah, but that's different to food shopping.
I hate food shopping!
I bet you buy something though?
Do n't you?
We do our in an hour!
We'd be in there three minutes!
And that's too long!
in an hour, they must think you're weird!
Well, well what do you do?

But they look.
Well I do n't think anybody's see how much the.
erm.
I mean.
Yes, but when you, you have to shop for us lot it can, and loads and loads and loads.
it gets a bit.
Oh!
Yeah, but you've always liked shopping anyway.
Joey used to say to me.
do n't go shopping with Jean!
I'm just gon na see how much the sultanas were at Tesco.
Is that how much?
I have to buy that.
It's a whole week, mind we do n't go out and erm when I came home just, the last evening, you know, after the play.
It was too hot!
Mind you, I thought it was nice.
Oh yeah, seventy five, they've gone up.
Yeah.
I'll buy some in Quicksave.
I only buy sultanas.
I only buy sultanas.
Yeah I have bought raisins, but normally they're, but they're not expensive are they?
Oh!
I'll change.
Yeah.
Oh.
I'm, I do n't like currants.
much, I think they're something and nothing, currants.
I got some currants that are left over.
from Christmas and.
I do n't usa, I mean, I ca n't be bothered with them.
Oh!
Are they?
I think if I make a cake today I I'd rather put sultanas in.
Well.
Yes.
I might get some mixed fruits.
He's.
he's tasted your marmalade.
I, I had a little taste.
I'm not very keen on marmalade.
No.
Well I think it was nice.
But I just do n't like bits.
No, I do n't.
And marmalade's.
too strong for me.
No.
He's got enough there.
Derek says to me something, he said all condensation in Jean's kitchen!
I said, well I'll ask her what.
that was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could n't see it.
Ah!
Oh!
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually in erm our bathroom and when we have a bath and a shower it always runs all down.
the tiles, so I do n't think you can do anything about it now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well why does n't, ca n't he do something about that or does he.
Yeah.
Ca.
Ah well.
Oh.
I do n't know.
See we've got air bricks up around ours.
We got two.
Well do n't they put air bricks in places?
Mm mm.
I thought they should do.
No.
Oh I should get that done because it might do something.
I dunno.
Perhaps they did n't bother.
Perhaps they did n't ever go up in the loft.
Wonder you can get up into.
You know.
You live up in your loft do n't you?

Mm.
Well ours is sort of, well Derek I told you, new ye, new year on the Sunday he went up and just threw some of ours out.
And I.
do n't know the I do n't think he's left much space.
Oh!
Oh dear!
Ah!
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
That was a, er do, do people make them now?
It was a rage was n't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ca n't you?
Oh!
Mm.
Dining room.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think they'd sell.
I've erm when Amanda and Claire were younger I bought a milk shake thing from.
the milkman and that was, that's stuck in the cupboard.
I said to Amanda when you get your own home you can, she loves milk shake!
So I said.
you can, and then I thought well if I ever do get grandchildren, no, I'll keep it.

And I've got a wok up there that I've never used.
Have you got a wok?
I did n't know what to do with it!
No, I'm gon na give it to Amanda and Claire because they'll use it.
They only have vegetarian food but they'll use it.
And I did use it once and I got in such a temper!
Cos you have to have it so the gas so high, it must be really boiling hot and you just stir fry the vegetables all round this.
er thing, and I thought I might as well use a frying a pan!
Ooh yes!
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
I do n't use it sometimes.
Only.
thing I do n't like u doing with the hands, pastry, so I'll use my food mixer, cos I.
do n't like mixing pastry.
It gets all, urgh!
Mm.
Yeah.
No.
Have you?
I'm waiting for you to make those things in your erm.
Sandwich maker?
Yeah.
Ah yeah.
Yeah.
Well I like to have a toasted sandwich for dinner.
I forget about it.
Yeah, but I ca n't have much.
I mean, I can only have fo lunchtime with Claire, like, I've been having tomatoes on toast and some.
Horrible are n't they?
And they've gone all, you see I have n't been eating them so they've been in the fridge and they've gone all soft.
And I thought, well that's not very interesting!
So I sprinkle about three strands of cheese.
Yo?
What, cut up or rings?
No the onion.
Chopped up?
Ah, not rings?
Does n't it bulge out the bread?
Well do n't you put weight on?
Claire's got to have pi pic piccalilli.
She has Branston sandwich she likes, not the ordinary pic, have you seen the sandwich pickle?
It's been chopped up much smaller.
Either that or, they like this.
They like this cos it's smaller.
Yeah.
But she likes the lumps in er, I was gon na buy some pickled onions today, till I saw the price!
I thought blow that!
Oh yeah.
Well you can pickle some for me.
I erm.
No.
Oh.
Well do n't put too much salt in!
Yeah.
Oh did you?
Oh!
I do n't eat.
many and I've stopped eating them at Christmas when I brought them and I started eating them again.
I I just li like.
Yeah, but they did n't have salt on these.
So I tho, I thought, you do n't do you?
Have you?
Oh!
Not the big one do you?
Big one?
Well I wear pop socks.
Alright I'll wash them out and I'll.
let you have them.
I was gon na take, I thought perhaps you did n't want anymore.
Well I'll erm wash them out, let you have those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, well I'll let.
you have those.
Could have the lot, I mean, I know, but erm.
I did have a load of that tops and I took them all down the.
So I got fed up, fed up with, a lot of, it's always full up!
Well why does n't he.
empty them!
Yeah I certainly am.
Went down there with all the wine bottles from Christmas do n't do but and then it's completely ruined!
People were just leaving boxes of them on the in the car park.
I, I thought the.
the lads could come aco, along there and smash them!
Yeah.
Ooh I know!
Yeah.
I do n't know, I'm not sure which ones yo, I just notice what says recyclable on them.
I do n't think you can put them all in now.
I thought they had to say recyclable.
I dunno.
And in this last bottle bank, it used to say up there green, clear, brown and other you see.
Well, they o, they have n't bothered up there, so I think people, I mean I was doing it, I was, she sort of shoved them in this thingie and I looked up and it said, green!
Well they've got a green bottle and they, they melt it down, it's gon na look green is n't it?
So I thought well, we've, we've, but I did n't see that.
I said to Claire, I said, I'm sticking them in the wrong one.
She said well it's too late now, the the clear one's full so we just anyway, went I went down the next day there's a new one or, next time, there's a new one down there so they, they must obviously think, well put them all in together.
I do, do n't know if you're supposed to pi, take the labels off are you?
You ta, you're supposed to take the tops off.
They do n't like you putting the tops in there.
Well I notice some people do do n't they?
Well I always take the labels off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I did n't well I, and I took the labels off the plastic bottles as well, but I notice people do n't.
No, it's Coke is n't it?
Erm.
Yes.
Like Coke.
Yeah.
Well I was thinking if you do this it helps with does n't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And tissues.
Recyclable tissues as well.
Mm.
Just us doing it wo n't, wo n't stop it.
Erm, I do n't know.
I look in peoples ' erm shopping trolleys at Tesco and they er do n't seem to er.
No.
No.
I do n't always do that.
I try to get recycled erm notepaper and.
You can get birthday cards a on recycled paper.
Mind, they're a bit more expensive.
And I know the Post Office prices have gone up with er cards.
Well they did n't use to be.
on cards.
They used to do birthday cards in there, in the Post Office.
They used to be from tha, and they still are in there.
See, the others, they're all about ninety nine.
for blank birthday cards, but in there they're forty, fifty for cards.
They're a lot cheaper.
Yeah.
No, I do n't like them.
I do n't even buy them for Derek.
I just like it when you open it it says happy birthday.
Or best wishes or some.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's not meant anyway.
That's right.
It's not meant.
Yeah.
And I think and perhaps when I was younger I used to buy it for Derek, but I would n't go there now, no.
He does n't really does he?
Just looks a card and buys it.
I bet he does n't he even read what was in.
Well.
really!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Card.
things, yeah.
Mm.
I bought Amanda a card yesterday cos she was a bit down so I thought, oh I'll send her one a card, and I got one from.
It's an old fashioned mangle, like mum used to have in the picture.
When I phoned up she said what a lovely card!
I said no!
Cos that was forty nine I said.
Oh, she said, I'm gon na frame that one mum.
Really, really nice it was!
Thought she was a bit down so I thought well I'll er send her a card.
They had a good job in the paper erm, part of the school.
But it was only for year.
But it's actually temporary that's what I'm, and erm it wan, it was starting in April so that was no good!
temp, you know.
They can keep the names in the school.
That's what they do, they have a year off er totally, then they go back again.
Oh no!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No, I wish erm you worked that as well.
Cos I was telling the children.
So I was trying not to talk.
Some it does.
Some it does.
Some it erm, I mean, I'll go Claire'll say, clean up the house!
Clear up this mess!
No, but I think it's very difficult for a mum.
Because what is done, I mean when I was in hospital his mum used to that try and pick up.
your stuff.
Yeah, but there's a, I can see how she does it because you've done it al, you know, for sixteen, seventeen years.
ca n't get out of the habit.
Mm.
Ah but you never.
Yeah.
Mind you,.
You know,.
Yeah, but you do forget sometimes, you sa, you still think they're..
You know and what do you think I am?
An and, and things like that, and yo it's automatic.
And if want to check quickly in a car and I'm driving I automatically put the hand.
I've done that to Pam and she could n't stop laughing!
Going along driving.
I said, I'm sorry Pam, I keep thinking your Ma Amanda.
No, you see, I automatically do it you see.
driver!
It is funny!
I do n't think so.
I do n't think that now.
I know, now, you could but, but Derek's reading that prospectus in the car today and it's, it's in Cardiff and he said they write in there and say that you know, they want mature students and, and, and this that and the other, and er, they give them erm, priority and well that's rubbish!
Well they, they sort of near enough said she would n't.
And yet, in the prospectus it does, yeah.
so I mean really they say, they're all going in there and perhaps she's not mature enough.
And I said, what do they call mature?
And he said over twenty ones.
I said.
Yeah.
last night.
When they say oh,, well they wo n't.
I said well what if they do?
I said they wo n't!
Mm.
She does n't want to work today.
No.
You ca n't force her.
Just says, I do n't wan na talk about it!
Well that's what she does you see.
She's talks about you if she does n't want to talk about it, she wo n't, she'll just walk out the room.
Mm.
But I did, I thought how unlike Claire.
And I thought those two girls on Friday, that play.
Derek said, bored to tears!
Now if that was Amanda there, like at the pantomime.
you see.
you sit, that's why I do n't like going to the theatre with Derek, he, he does n't clap or anything!
Well I mean, th the thing is those poor people have got up there and.
he says they're doing the re, rehearsing for what?
Eight weeks did he say?
Every night I expect.
Oh I thought the blonde girl was a.
bit wooden.
Yes.
Yeah I did n't look like it was her.
Yeah.
Well I.
I did see cos she was er.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I thought the other girl was good.
Er well I thought it was good how they did the se se scenes, they were.

So that was good.
was n't it?
No, I thought she were, I thought goodness knows!
Derek said they'd been having sex!
I said, he says th no, they'd have that other girl, but she was quite roly-poly.
Remember that one we went to see her, and sh she undressed?
She.
Yes!
Yeah!
But then the other girl was like stick was n't she?
Derek said Jean wo n't want to go again.
Yes she will.
I think she was just a bit hot.
I said, in fact, when she's got herself sorted out we'll go down to Poole Art Centre and see.
some plays down there.
We'll get the he's not coming!
Ge, if Amanda's, well Amanda loves it so when.
she comes down, she'd.
really love going!
Erm.
Well, you did have your gloves on.
You did have your fur boots on.
Derek said he'd no but Derek said he felt.
too hot!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was hot in, I mean everybody was very red faced.
were n't they?
Yeah, but it's your hot flushes!
, yeah.
But, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But then Claire came home with me.
Cos we missed Coronation Street did n't we last night?
And I did n't record it because we wanted to record something but actually, I do n't, I think Coronation Street.
Did you?
Yes, I mean I, some episodes are better than others I suppose.

Yeah.
Yeah?
Her?
Mm.
Mm mm.
A nice looking boy though.
Mm.
But I do n't know how they can have them as twins do you?
Mind, not all twins are identical are they?
Yeah.
Yeah, bu bu bu perhaps the other one will be nice when he.
gets older.
And I thought, you know, Tracey's getting to him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but she.
You know, she came home and she was watching television and I bought some Bourbon biscuits round and then I thought I'll have one with my cup of tea and now there's three left!
I said, do you realise you've eaten the whole packet!
She does n't know what she's doing!
See, well, she just puts her hand in, eats it, hand in, eat, that's, she does n't even know what she's doing!
I said you're gon na get a.
I said you're gon na put weight on, if.
you're not careful!
Especially Bourbon biscuits.
I said but er.
it was only a little bit.
Oh years ago!
Yes.
Yeah I know.
They say.
you should eat Digestive biscuits cos they're.
I do n't know.
Oh yeah!
Did they get your toilets or not?
Oh they did n't have one?
No, it's a portable bit er.
Yeah!
Oh no!
Oh dear!
Can you hear that stupid noise again?
Listen.
That's the water pressure.
Why do n't you wash your hands in the bathroom?
Oh well.
goodness me Jean!
If they have n't thought about that!
Where, in there?
Yeah, well they were tiled nicely.
It's the ones upstairs Derek said about.
Yeah.
Yeah but Derek made those himself.
He did n't tile them but he.
make them himself.
I'm, I'm cold!
Well I think it looks nice!
I I, I said to Derek, I do n't know why Jean's so.
she was a disappointed!
Yeah, but that's cos of Joe.
Oh well I have n't had anybody so fussy.
Yeah.
They all seem a bit wide, I must admit.
Oh has n't he?
No?
Yeah, but er, some of them are a bit out of true cos they're seconds do you think?
They may have been so er the.
Yeah.
Actually, that's why Derek's never done tiling, cos he's not very good at it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I thought it looked, I thought it looked all right.
No.
It's the I not, I mean he should have grouted that little bit and he should n't have put.
that tile there actually.
But then, Derek said they have n't got the time to.
fiddle he said.
Now, with Joey, he would have.
had all day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but you see, they have n't got the time to do.
that.
You do n't want them there any longer do you?
Yeah.
I I did n't think he was that untidy, but Derek thought that was awful leaving all that outside!
But they know you're not like that do n't they, round and about?
They know you've got builders there.
You wan na see Pam's house!
Yeah could have.
Yeah.
Well he should n't have left tiles outside somebody could have taken those!
No.
No.
Yeah.
When are you erm.
What are you doing this afternoon?
Yeah.
Bit cold out I thought today.
I feel cold in.
here.
Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah.

Yeah.
Still it's only for another day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's only another day.
No.
Yeah, really going.
Yeah.
You wan na be married to Ron then.
He leaves he leaves all I thought Kath would have phoned me because I wrote her a letter and normally when I write her a letter she sort of, phones about the next day but she.
I was wondering about Ron.
Well I think she would have told us would n't she?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I did n't like the sound of it much when she said it did n't, it was still weeping.
That's how it was with Elise.
But there you are, I mean, he.
but she said that happened with him when he had the erm what did he have an operation for?
Was it, was it haemorrhoids?
No!
I.
something did n't heal.
then.
Yeah.
No.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, see that bone in that.
I mean, although there's.
there it healed up quite quickly.
I can rub it now, it's alright.
Yeah.
No.
Except on a lump, you know, I've still got sa a lump there.
A real hard lump!
And when I go and have my erm, smear test which I keep putting off.
Erm.
Well, I'll go and have.
it done.
Erm I'm gon na, if it's still there I'm gon na ask Doctor and ask him why.
the lump's still there.
Cos that's a month now, is a month.
Unless it was, Derek, Derek said she really jabbed in the.
in the ne, oh the needle there.
Ah no, she was nice.
is tha is that the friendly one?
I mean, and she was nice!
Yes.
It's ni, oh I forgot to say thanks.
Yep.
And I've got a navy blue and white striped.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's big on me, so I do n't know what it's like.

No, this Derek's talking about your man being.
Well what i, what is it?
Oh yeah.
Just put it on one side.
I'm not feeding it!
We do n't feed it.
Yes.
I want to get a bit of.
Yes.
It's looking as though it's a bit dead that.
Ooh looks it's gone a funny colour!
It should be quite warm and now it's not.
These, these have lasted a long time have n't.

Those.
That was Mrs's.
I thought well nobody's taken it.
I'll get it.
It's got like erm.
mm, I thought well it's go with the plant does n't it?
Well they did n't take it.
It's down there, nobody wan I wanted to put something in, in that window.
I was thinking of dried flowers and then I, and then I thought no, I think I'll.
Well it'd have to big would n't it?
No it would n't go in there, it's not wide.
enough.
Just gon na have to go on the little table in the corner right between.
the chairs, you see.
There, so.
Well I thought about putting some, at the moment buy some erm daffodils or something.
But I do n't think they're.
gon na be in now this.
time of year.
Well he, down here?
They're tiles.
Horrible they are!
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah well do n't get too light a.
colour.
Yeah.
And you're gon na have mahogany or was.
thinking of having mahogany.
so it'll be better to have a.
different but you see that one's, you know what I'm like with Domestos and.
stuff, if you look on the tiles you'll see a line where I've dropped,.
where I've dropped it for, well then, it's the toilet brush you see, I've been going like this with the toilet.
Does n't say a lot.
Oh dear!
I've got my special clothes with the trademark all the way thr.
I must come out.
You can tell I have n't been out in the garden lately I need, it needs to ci, it's been too cold!
Mine, th they're, they're taking ages to come up, I mean.
Mm!
Bud?
See the ones that are growing there's nothing there look.
They're not gon na, they're gon na be blind are n't they?
Late.
Tulips can go in late.
No, you've got to put them too deep.
You've got ta put them deep.
If you put them to shallow they come up.
blind.
Yeah.
Well I'll see you then.
Yes.
He says today he'll finish?
Yeah.
No, wo n't be so bad.
I'll see you then.
Bye!
See you!
Ooh!
Alright?
Not too bad thank you.
Not very nice morning is it?
Was it foggy where you came from?
Was it?
Oh!
I was surprised cos yesterday Claire came in and she said, ooh, it's really foggy tonight mum!
And I thought.
it ca n't be foggy, it was a nice.
I thought it was a nice sunny day yesterday, how can it be foggy?
Anyway, I've turned it off so it's colder for you.
not, not boiling hot.
Yes thank you.
Yeah.
Well, it's a lot better than when you saw me last time!
Well it's not it's not a hundred percent but this is how I'm gon na be I think.
I think I get a few,, excuse me things but it's not too bad.
I know it's there all the time.
Do you want a cup of tea or a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
Tea?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Pardon?
White with two.
Ah so.
Good!
Not many people are are they at the moment?
Yeah.
Oh he's very busy!
Yeah.
Lots of people that are finding it very difficult are n't they?
Oh I think they do.
Yeah.
Derek's are mainly, there's a sort of few new ones but.
Mind, not everybody's got the money to erm pay for jobs have they, today, if they've been made redundant they have n't got the money.
Well I think it's gon na get worse before it's gets better actually, I think it's erm I do n't know.
Oh!
Oh I think they ought to have them cleaned every year do n't you?
That one's sort of exploding a bit again, like something I know when it does, it needs cleaning!
It all makes a funny noise!
It's sort of a louder noise than normal this, you know.
Yeah, so I think oh well, it's about time you came.
Actually, probably, could do with a new boiler thing I should think.
A bit old is n't it?
Ai n't it?
Mm.
Oh do you?
Oh!
How long did it take you to get down here?
About three quarters of an hour does it?
Yeah.
Well yeah.
Was it?
Oh.
We went for a week's holiday at Salisbury.
Well, cos of my back last year I could n't go very far so we thought, where can we go for a break?
And we went, we had a nice time.
It was great!
In erm yes, it's the ring road, in a a a listed building.
What was the road called?
Do you know as you come in to Salisbury and you have to keep going on with the traffic, then it leads up to the bridge where the wa, where the river is.
That ro, what's it called?
It's got like the back of the supermarket, back of the er Marks and Spencers.
No I do n't know what it's.
No.
Was it?
Oh!
Yeah!
But.
Oh are there?
Yeah, they're all listed are n't but as we came we came in the way we would come, I'm a bit ignorant, so I suppose we were.
That big.
Yeah you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, the ring ring road round, yes, and then you.
Yeah.
Yeah, well i, on the left?
Or on the ri.
Yeah, then I think we went is there a road to left?
Is there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I ca n't remember.
Anyway, it was a lon, there's a little restaurant in the road, and it was back of sort of erm Mar, if you wal, you crossed over and if you went through a little slip where it came, you came into this little arcade of shops where o, about in the road next to er.
Do n't ask me!
That sounds about right!
That's sounds about the name.
Yeah.
I think that's in New Street.
It was by the hospital.
It was in the road of the hospital.
We were down, we were down much further and the hospital was that opposite the park, like, is it the park or something?
No, we overlooked erm a horrible block of flats!
That was very nice, the outlook there, but the outlook at the back was ever so, it was beautiful!
Cos we could see the spire of the cathedral.
I think it was in, it was in the, but it was in the back road of the hospital, not the front road.
The back kind.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, ever so, we enjoyed it.
But it was very cold.
Yeah, ca n't remember where we went.
My memory's hopeless!
You know, it was sometime last year and I ca n't remember if it's early or late.
But it was quite nice, we had a nice time.
There's lots of little walks to go on are n't.
there?
Round er, and they're all qui, er nice shops there.
Oh!
Enjoyed it!
Yeah.
Yeah, it was nice.
We thoroughly enjoyed it!
What kind is there?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I think it's quite nice.
The only thing is, I think it's quite a way for you to travel is n't it?
Erm I mean, you do n't always come here do you?
Oh!
Do you come here every day?
Oh!
I do n't know if I'd wan na do that every day.
Is it worse in the summer?
Yeah.
I do n't know i.
Yeah.
That's right.
Because when we came home, we came home on a Friday night, I say, and oh, the traffic!
I think it took us about an hour and a half to get home!
Especially coming up, co, just coming up to Salisbury, coming up to all those roundabouts.
Cor!
We thought we wished we'd left earlier now.
It was, no I mean thoroughly enjoyed it!
We'll try and be a bit more adventurous this year and go a bit further!
But I ca n't sit in the car very long.
It's terrible!
It's a problem.
Well I was thinking of Cambridge but I do n't think I, Derek's going to Holland.
for a long weekend to do with er, every ten years there's a garden thing in Holland, I do n't, forget what they call it.
Flor Florade or something.
I ca n't go.
I could n't tra, it's er, on a coach.
I could n't do it.
So he's going to Holland for three or four days.
So I'm er I said perhaps, because Steve li, have you been to Cambridge?
No.
Steven said it's nice at Cambri, I think we've been through it.
Yeah.
Yeah, but it's quite, I do n't know how to, it's about three hours I should think.
You know.
Have to wait and see.
Cos you could break the journey up a bit?
Yeah.
I'd have to do it every hour.
I ca n't sit for much longer than an hour.
It's a pain innit!
I never thought I'd have back problems!
Nearly everybody you talk to the fact, they have back problems.
It's a wonder you do n't get them lifting boilers and things!
Yeah.
And I said, Derek has to be careful, because you do n't know when you.
And he was doing, and they're humping a lot of concrete last week and I think his back's aching.
I said, now you know how I felt!
How are your children?
Adults, children?
How old?
Oh adult.
Oh!
How she's getting on?
Okay?
