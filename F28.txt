I put my meat in and er, and erm tt my onions.
Yeah, stew pack.
with all sorts in it, onions.
turnip, carrots, er all, all the root veg like you know.
so what I did I put another carrot in extra.
and a couple of onions in extra and er.
some celery what I got fresh, I cooked some of that cos that's what I got from that bloke.
What love?
Yeah that's that stuff.
you did n't grumble about it did you this time?
I just did it in the pan on top.
and I did it er.
the burner and then simmered it, I put, did n't put my kidney in well, when I put my veg in.
because kidney do n't take as long to cook.
as stew meat does it?
But that stew meat I got that.
that from Cleethorpes you know.
We've got.
we've got stew meat, we got erm lamb, I got, I do n't know how many joints of lamb, I got er, I do n't know how many joints of that er rib of beef you know?
Oh that's beautiful.
and it's only ninety eight pence a pound, it's absolute gorgeous int it Alec?
So er.
Well it's rib of beef int it?
They do n't call it that.
they do n't call it that, but it is that int it?
That's what it is a rib of beef.
cos I said to him can you, can you cut me small ones he said well they're from the rib of the beef he said and it depends on the size of the beef what size your.
you know, and he brought this piece up, oh and it was pretty gorgeous, so Alec says how much is that piece?
And he said er ten pound were n't it, but it made four joints, yeah.
lovely joints, you know like er with a bone and the, the meat.
all around it like that.
I thought we'll have it.
Well.
it will do me erm er, er Sunday joint a dinner and then there's some left for Monday and then there's some left for a stew you know.
which I usually make it into.
a stew and put.
it in freezer and I.
bring it out, you know.
like when we have it.
Is it alright?
Right, we'll be having all them erm.
all them eggs you know, when we went to Alec, when they were selling these trays of eggs, er, we went there with Alec, so I said I'll have one like, and they were really fresh, but when I got home I got that thing of, from Kwiksave, I got the whole packet, big packet.
so I'd got all that, I think it's forty odd eggs ai n't I just.
us two, we do n't use many, so I made, I made quiches, I put them in raw in the freezer, you know ready just to cook.
bring out and cook, I made sponge cakes, fruit cakes, er.
yorkshire pudding, I had to use them up did n't I, cos I do n't like eggs laid about, you know, I do n't like them being there a lot.
boil them we have we have, we do n't eat many eggs, though, do what?
Yeah, but I've had it, I mean I've had them a week now have n't I?
I do n't like to keep them too long eggs, you know, especially with this scare being on.
Is it?
Yeah I suppose it would of been alright like, but I do n't like keeping them.
and anyway this fellow said do you want some rabbit it's a pound each, so we ordered some rabbits, ai n't got them yet like, but I do n't know if we'll get them or not.
so whether we'll get them or not, I do n't know.
we ordered ten so I do n't know whether we'll get, maybe if we'd ordered two we might of got them, but er, ordering ten is a lot ai n't it?
Why are you.
Have you done it like?
Who do.
Oh is he gon na do it for you?
Oh.
So erm anyway goes in, I said to him other day, I asked him other week, he says our turn to give me a ring.
anyway Bob said oh you'll see him on Friday, I says Bill is a busy bloke you know, I says you ca n't just go on Friday and expect to do it over weekend.
he might of booked somebody else in.
Anyway, erm, I do n't know where he's got all this lot from, somebody must of said at work that, what's wheel bearing er gate steering?
Dunno what that is, I mean oh we have n't got a clue, he's not got a clue on car, do n't know where he's got that bloody lot from, so besides other things that want checking for MOT, I think he wants them to check.
for them so.
we've managed to drive.
well where've you got that from then Ann?
Oh.
Might of done it.
cos there's not many cars in that yard when we past.
No they've been.
that's it, when we went past er that Sunday, was it Easter Sunday we went and.
Saturday, Saturday we.
No, nobody.
The, the, the thing was empty.

so we had to take a hundred and twenty five pound off what we owed.
and if we paid it before the end of January.
we got twenty nine pounds summat off.
nearly thirty pound off, so we did, took that off and I sent the rest.
and I took my hundred and twenty five off.
and I sent the rest.

But er, he ai n't spent his yet, I've spent mine, I've spent mine.
Go on if you had a bloody some bloody stuff nicked last Saturday.

He had some stuff nicked, a ski jacket which cost me seventy five quid it were half, the rest it should of been a hundred and fifty.

I took her to school last week, anyway I think it were last Thursday.
Mm.
Thursday aye er, she come home and I said to her where's your ski jacket?
She says oh she says I've left it in sports hall, it's locked up in a locker.
so erm tt so anyway Saturday we gets to Durham, she's says oh your Alex was just been on phone, she'd, she'd been up to school to do a hockey match.
sports hall's been broke into er used a door bar and broke into all lockers, so her ski jacket's gone.

You know that Sandra.
she were parked at side of me.
Yeah, anyway only her in when mine got pinched and, and erm Kath's got pinched and the police.
customer's.
er and said.
and said there's nobody, we did n't see anybody, because her Carol parks the side of mine an'all, she'd gone.

So.
Oh do n't bloody joke.
I could n't get out this morning, all the trouble, I've had a fortnight's troubles, he's there the week.
Mm it seems though it's funny not come in next, last week did n't it?
Yeah, oh Belinda's been going bloody crackers again.
Oh I've never known anybody like her, er I think it's an.
anyway.
but, you know erm, I told you she ran subsidy did n't I?
A hundred and forty seven quid a week.
Well she created on Christmas.
cos she got to three thousand or summat.
and then she kept saying they owed her some money you know.
fifty odd quid.
anyway when I come back in one day, she says to me, she says listen to this, a neighbour were sat here.
I says what?
She says Chris, that's her in office, she's told me that I'm off the subsidy now, she says I've been on it twelve week and er.
area manager now.
Mr manager at branch mean the area manager us, she said he's not even had the decency to tell me himself.
she said Chris oh you're off the subsidy, she said I'd got my wages anyway, er because she'd only collected sixteen hundred and, hundred pounds so that, seven six are forty two, hundred and two pound you see.
then they stop her this tax what she owes them all, well she's been getting a hundred and forty seven.
and she says that, oh this is wrong Chris.
she says er I'm er guaranteed, she says oh no you're not, she says Ruth's told me last week to take you off guarantee, so they took her off like.
Mm.
oh and took her off and David says to me she's a bloody fool to have sent, says instead of keeping her mouth shut, she's, there's George claim nowt, you know what I mean?
George is saying things to him and they're saying you ca n't do this and they ca n't do that, well they can do what they want ca n't they?
So they took our subs in.
So she said.
cos she, she kept saying that they owed her.
fifty odd quid but.
she did n't cos working it out by week.
she's quids in int she?
She's had one good week.
at Christmas.
which we do.
and.
and as the trustee so she bloody guaranteeing a hundred and forty seven pound.
and Graham took.
it off her and I said she's going mad.
Yeah, you know if, if they alter your round.
if they alter your round, er and it's not collecting as much.
so, you know, to give chance, chance to go.
Yeah.
No.
Mm.
Well if she wanted to earn her own money.

Mm.
No David did here, she just did.
Monday and Thursday.

and erm then she wanted some more Argos vouchers so I'll have them.
so anyway she said anyway er she's had this bloody Aga put in, you know she had that other Aga in did n't she?
It's run on solid fuel, it's a cooker.
and er.
you put, put coke in.
and it heats your oven up, it's got all temperature thing on it a hot, hot plate, she had one before.
Yeah, but it were n't smokeless so she's had to change it.
and it's cost them two thousand pound.
Well when I went on.
Well I went not last Friday but the Friday before, they were doing it.
they'd got it in right, cos she was showing my how it worked and that, all.
control, but it's run on coke.
anyway she says oh she says it's gon na be a feature here, it's a beauty, I mean I do n't like old line, I do n't, you know for the money what they costs, cooker.
Yeah.
and, but she says like it, you know what I mean like.
Er that's run off her fire now, that's not run off it, that's just for a cooker that.
Yeah.
Well no it for the, the heating's swapped over cos.

Oh God.

Well you watch your bills if you have do n't you really.
I mean you do n't go mad at it do you?
I mean look at what's.

because you see all this bloody expensive Aga, they wo n't be.
towards that council, I mean like she's gon na have it tough again you know what I mean?

You could have white faces, I ca n't can I?
I ca n't do it all in this wool, with that many different colours to do, if they did it in, if they made ounce balls if they made it, did ounce balls it wo n't be so bad, but that's a hundred gramme that, so.

Tinned salmon, yeah.
No.

I never touch it.
fish to me was my mother making me sit at a.
table.
from dinner time to tea time, to eat this fish.
for me dinner.
and I would n't eat it.
I tried it, but it used to, I used to, I just did not like fish.
and when ever anybody talks of fish it's just me sitting at the table from dinner time and then she.
realized I did n't like it.
Yeah, when I were.
when I was er.
when I was expecting our John.
Yeah, I used to go down to and I used to pass these fish shops, I had to have fish and chips.
cos I do n't know why they've got blooming queues in fish shop.
he says well why do n't you use your pass?
You're pregnant, you know your book.
I said I'm not standing here queuing letting everybody know I'm pregnant.

You know?
Yeah, I thought these things that I do n't wear that I like the material of, it's good material, it's a matter of trying built it up.
otherwise it might just as well get chucked out might n't it?
Here half a one int it?
Mm, good that vinegar though cos I sliced some onion, I like it like that, do you?
