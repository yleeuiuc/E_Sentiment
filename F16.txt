Bloody peerage for him.
Well I should think she has.
It's cold.

Well that's like her.
She would n't take no notice.
Pat??
Yeah.
I would n't be surprised if he does.
Let's face it Geoff he ai n't paid you.

He had the bloody gall to.
ring me today and say that's got diarrhoea, he'll keep the car today but he do n't want it tomorrow can you find someone else who wants it.
I said that's the last time.
Go and pick him up.
Geoff said if I had n't have wanted the money I would n't have bothered.
Well we ai n't got paid anyway yet.
No I did n't th I should imagine, I thought he said you did n't, I would imagine he gets paid at the end of the month.
Well that ai n't a very good firm is it really?
But then I suppose they do n't get paid until the people.
Where's mum's little black bag Jonathan?
My bag.
Karate?

So Geoffrey's gon na ring the bloke when he he's gon na try and get hold of Mr later on and ring him because we've got to let this other man know you know he ca n't have it.
Yeah but we ai n't got it here for Sunday you see.
But he knows.

We usually have it Sunday to Monday.
So.
Geoff's gon na ring him and perhaps.

Yeah well he might not be home till late you see so we've got we've really got to wait so Geoff will probably ring this man when he come home.
Alright then?
Oh alright.
Yeah Yeah.
Okay then?
Yeah bye.
I know.
Oh it ai n't getting very warm in here yet is it?
We'll go and sit in the room soon.

That looks a bit tidier do n't it?
Well he will do if he that.
Jonathan.
You wan na come and feed your.
Here Jonathan.
Whole load for it.
Make sure you properly.
She is absolutely petrified of that cat.
Literally petrified.
It does n't seem to be getting very warm in here to me.
Well it's only on about seventeen.
Twenty.
Well they have theirs on one con continuously do n't they?
See we do n't have our heating on continuously.
Well I was cold down mum's last Sunday.
Oh yeah.
Yeah well there's three of us have baths.
Jonathan.
Do n't keep banging.
And her mother does all the all the washing for the when she us does hairdressing does all the washing, all them towels, hangs them out.
Buys this, buys that.
She uses her mother's electric.
Telephone.
Mind you Val said I ca n't help her out sort of financially cos she has n't got it, but she said I can he, I said well you do help her out financially.
I said in that way.
She said well I ca n't give her any money cos I have n't got any.
Yeah so I mean really the twenty five pound a week she's not paying her mother she could go to pay a mortgage.
Twenty five pound a week.
What, for the boys?
That's still thirty five pound a week.
That's a hundred and forty pound a month.
So twelve months that's twelve.
Well that's why she do n't need to go to work innit?
Well I could n't live off my son like that.
Mind you she is, let's fa she does help that youngest one out.
She is helping him out cos he ai n't got a job.
So you know she she said he gets it back in the long run.
Oh she said he absolutely loves Tesco's.
She said he's hoping they're gon na give him full employment.
Yeah.
I do n't like shopping in there, let alone working in there..
Well I've done that job stacking shelves.
That's a.
and you, it was alright, and guess what he stacked the first day he was there?
Turkey!
Yeah!
She said he said er I could n't believe it but she said he did n't mind cos it was all frozen.
So she said were n't it marvellous.
Well worked with Geoff at Turner's Turkeys he lasted three days.
Yeah.
His wife?
His mother!
Duane.
Hook it on.
That's what I thought.
Well would n't do very much well at that cos too short.
Mm.
He said he was always on another planet.
What was that thing come through from Les this morning?
Do you think you'll get some tax back Geoff?
How much will you get back then?
Oh so you might get some of that back?
When should you get it though?
In the next few weeks?
Mm.
Let's hope it does then.
Well that'll be just right for thingme for christmas then, some more money.
He wants you to ring him you know.
Ring him Geoff because of.
Yeah.
Well that's what I thought myself after you'd been there ring him then.
What you hoping then that the building society are gon na lend you the money so you can pay your bank draft off?
How much were the repayments on that thing?
The worst thing we ever did.
No not yet.
No he's not gon na pay them off.
He's paying what he ow got behind.
Yeah but then he'll, we should be able to manage then to pay the mortgage and pay them and keep on the level peg.
That's right.
So we're paying.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well that's what he's said.
He'll p, all he, all the money we get we'll just put into the building society and pay the bills from the building society.
Geoff can go.
They're ha quite happy to do it once a month but like you said what they will not do erm obviously is to have a lot of sort of things like standing orders and that sort of thing.
They do n't wan na know about that.
Yeah but you do n't want to do standing orders then do you?
Yeah but if you if you.
Yeah but Geoff if you keep a record when you took money in when you draw it out.
We'll keep a complete record of it.
Yeah but then if he had to find anything then.
They're gon na want to know why.
Yeah but then.
yeah but yeah but then on the other hand, let's face it our business.
has fluctuated.
That's been on a real high and then gone down to a low to nothing.
So you do n't get many names in that book anyway.
And that is how it has been.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah but what.
Yeah but if you do it above board I ca n't see.
Cory oil?
Yeah but I ca n't see how they can say anything as long as you've got a legitimate receipt for it.
See that you have done.
Well how do you go on then?
Yeah but on the.
yeah but on the other hand Geoff if they took that attitude with everybody, nobody would.
Well why do n't you just prewarn them before you're gon na do it and say look I'm no longer gon na use this bank I'm er.
Yeah alright Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Geoff.
there's Joe.
For you.

You know what she's like.
Well she does cause a lot of.
Well why the hell does she.
Which shop does she work in?
Well I would n't have thought she'd have gone in a shop like that anyway cos there's some more expensive stuff in there.
Yeah but the whole point is.
I mean she's always saying she's always saying how you know she, oh my kids this, my kids that.
Well if that woman loses her job through what Pam has said she's not gon na be very nice to her children is she?
Well Paul do n't like never used to like it.

Mm.
You what Jonathan?
You do n't like her?
Oh.
They ran after them.

Nobody.
Well he likes to, I do n't know whether nobody's cleared up the field, that looks a mess.
Yeah.
I thought Liz Taylor was dead?
What?
Well if you want one, have one.
Do n't let us stop you.
Winnie?
Aah!
Why, what's on Sky?
Oh.
Oh.

I'm surprised father ai n't had it.
Jonathan do no.
Hey, when have you been treating yourself to that one then?
Oh.
He keeps buying all these things.
People could buy them.
Oh.
Oh I see.
Have you seen it?
Oh.
No because they're in a plastic cover are n't they?
Which one's that?
Oh.
Jonathan.
Do n't keep doing that.
Yeah no do n't.
Yeah alright.
Cos that picks it up.
Whatever does Geoff Geoff ai n't bothered if she does your.
Oh I should n't worry about it.
I do it.
No, suppose not.

No that's alright.
You want to hear it.
How much?
I like them Chippendales, I think they're nice.
Wonder why they're called Chippendales?
Well I suppose Chippendales is er antique furniture innit?
They're male strippers.
Would you like to see them Sue?
Are they?
Cor Sue if ever you get any tickets to see them, we'd better go and see them.
He's still up there look.
Skeletor?
He-man.
I reckon that was one of the then.
Did you did you do any more?
I'll perhaps get up there next Sunday and do it.
If it's a nice day I'll go up.
Yeah well I'm lighter than you are n't I?
Do you know mum we're do Geoff's got he's done all down the sides, all round the back so he's he's threequarters of the way.
Yeah but you've done all round the kitchen bit have n't you?
And all that.
and he's now going up the point of the house but he ca n't get no further.
So I've got ta go and do that point bit.
So I said well if I go up me being light, I'll go up and he holds the ladder.
Well he went on it.
He did it.
Yeah but I said Geoff said well he what did he use?
I said well that I said but he's a lot taller than you Geoff.
is n't he?
He's got the height to do it.
Big.
Yeah about Bobby's stomach around is n't he?
What Brian?
He's quite big, Brian is is n't he?
Oh no.
No I have n't told him.
Sue you tell him cos you know how the story goes.
No.
Geoff.
I wonder who the?
Yeah but he did go out with a girl there for a while did n't he?
In London.
They reckon she was.
What is it Jonathan, what are you doing?
So you ask.
What's he got mum?
No do n't.
No he do n't like children Jonathan.
He's frightened.
No erm Fuji Juji she'll play with you, look.
Yeah so it sounds as, he's got a lot of skeletons in his cupboard.
I think we could write a book about our family, what goes on with someone ha going out with someone else and blimey!
So do I.
Have n't they just.
Yeah but he ai n't rejected this kidney he's had has he?
Cor he looks.
He cut him up or something did n't he?
So he was waiting for him?
It's surprising thumping him in the back did n't kill him with the kidney failure innit?
Did they have the ambulance and that?
And they found him on the floor?
But that that bloke, that bloke he'll thump anybody wo n't he Geoff?
He used to carry on with that.
carry on with that girl up the road there did n't he?
Yeah.
What's she like now?
Is she married?
Yeah I was telling mum.
I said we could get get our house inside it.
Twice.
Well believe it or not that tells you how people are lucky.
They've bui got out a new what is it?
A new roof tile.
And this firm he thinks because he's gon na have his roof done with these roof tiles, these new type they're gon na give him them!
To show them.
And he's gon na get his house re-roo.
all roofed for nothing.
I said my god!
Cor!
Money goes to money.
Well no.
Do n't put that on there Jonathan.
It do n't play.
And build.
No, it's further round.
And he's gon na all them.
Yeah but he never picked an we did.
We picked them.
He never sold any of them.
Never sold a plum at all.
Yeah but he was s that was him who was saying they use a lot of plums and puree stuff in babyfood.
But now they're not using plums any more, they're using marrow.
Cos it's cheaper.
So, well you imagine what go into bloody babyfoods?
Yuk.
That's all water and starch is n't it?
No it goes moul goes mouldy.
very quick.
Yeah.
What you mean?
But it was mouldy!
Geoff's mum got me a piece of cheese last week from Superkeys.
On the Friday.
I opened it on Saturday and it was mouldy.
Wrapped up and we thought that had perhaps been.
Oh yeah cos he said he'd.
I did press it.
Perhaps I did n't press it hard enough.
Are you supposed to press them at the same time?
on there.
Yeah.
Taboo?
Tayboo.
Aah!
That's orange juice and we we had a free sample one year.
Them, that girl give a free sample.
Orange and erm oh like a vod.
What is it, vodka orange and.
and something else.
Jonathan do n't do that mate.
Well do you know.
Cor.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
Yeah and we was looking at the the wines and spirits in there.
Cos I like that, that erm Lambrusco.
wine.
Wine.
It's a white wine, it's ever so ni.
Lambresco.
And in there how much was it?
In Gateways.
That was three pound.
Yeah two forty nine was the ordinary wine.
And it's two pound in my village shop.
So I said to Geoff I'll get it up the village shop.
Yeah but you could get Lambresco again.
but non-alcoholic.
And that was what?
That was only one forty nine a bottle.
Which is cheap cos a lot of non-alcoholic wines are expensive.
What do you like to drink?
Not bothered?
No.
?
Oh I might have one of them.
You've got some.
Joey bought you some.
I ai n't drunk mine yet.
I ai n't even started it.
I got a bottle of gin a bloke bought me three years ago.
That should be some powerful stuff.
Bugger me.
That was bloody revolting.
We tried it.
Oh my god!
Do n't hurt granddad's toes Jonathan.
What?

Tabasco.
Well it just suddenly come to me.
I knew I'd seen it but I'd never tried it.
Oh what is that then?
That's orange juice and what then?
I think it's orange juice and rum.
White rum.
You know erm.
That's.
Yeah but you could put something with it if you wanted.
Oh Geoff it's dreadful in there.
Oh the smoke hit you, do n't it mum?
Well when I go, I went u I just wo n't have washed my hair on Sundays cos if I go there to get mum, I know damn well my hair's gon na stink, so I might as well not bother.

You'd like everything.
She lovely for her age?
We've got a picture of her in the health club in a leotard doing a pose like that.
In a white leotard.
And she's right, as you go down the.
corridor you go to the studio at the end then the toning tables there.
If you look down the corridor there's a big picture of her.
on the end wall in this white leotard.
And then I always say I definitely.

She's over fifty you know.
Mind you, you do n't know how much help they have do you?
Where is that?
I was just.
I done a one the other day that was twenty five pence it was some charity thing.
You'd got.
What you had to do they're making a giant they're making a giant.
christmas pudding.
And you've got to guess how much it will weigh.
So I put seven hundred and sixty five.
pound five ounces.
And the first prize is two hundred.
fifty pounds worth of carpet.
So I thought I'll have a new carpet in my hall.
Yeah.
What are them three doing?

No, she's got sort of a medium brick but she's got a brown mortar.
But that, that that is innit Geoff?
I've seen, I've I've not seen brickwork like it.
It is immaculate.
That is really good innit Geoff?
Well he's not piecework is he?
Well it's only a bungalow is it?
There's three men been working on it all the time.
I get fed up with it.
I may go to bed early and read me books.
Oh if I was me and I was on my own I'd ha I'd have to have the telly in the bedroom.
I tell you what I'd like to do in Jonathan's.
You know he's got his telly standing on that dressing table?
What I want, you can bu.
You can buy a little thing.
My portable aerial works lovely.
What I want to do.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah well what I want for Jonathan's bedroom, you can buy them.
You put them in the sort of the corner, Mr's got one, you extend your telly.
Yeah well one of them'd be handy for Jonathan's bedroom.
No, not too high.
Yeah to put that portable telly on and then he's got all the space on the top for his computer.
Cos there ai n't a lot of space for the is there?
Well yeah we could I tell you what.
we could put on.
We could put under there to hang some bits and pieces up, some of them little sticker things.
Then you can hang some up under.
Like mum's got her tea towels on.
Or put some well I do n't wan na start drilling holes in it.
What do you wan na hang on it then?
His dressing table.
Yeah well mum's yeah but you can get them.
Well a desk.
You can get them little hooks like I hang my tea cloths on.
Some pretty little ones.
If you put it underneath the desk, a few of them.
And then the light gun could slot in that.
Pardon?
A stollen?
Never tried it.
You're not making a christmas cake are you?
I've got a dundee cake.
Well they do.
Well I got a little Dundee cake.
Well I ai n't bothered cos Geoff'll eat it for his lunch.
You like a drop of port do n't you Geoff?
Mm.
Well do you know if I'd thought about it.
No do n't Jonathan.
If I'd have thought about it, that wedding cake she give me.
If I'd have took that icing off that cake was as moist as anything, I could have re-marzipanned that.
and re-iced that for christmas.
But Geoff has eaten it.
I I sent his.
I sent his friend, cos his friend loves cherries.
so I sent his friend bi when I cut it there's some bits got ever so many cherries in so I sent his friend up with the cherries in.
And what did you do?
Give him the cherries and ate the cake and then Geoff told him.
And Geoff was.
and Geoff was eating them.
I shall put him a bit in tomorrow though.
He do n't have no dinner.
His wife do n't pack him up.

down n yeah she was dressed sat down and ha she did n't even, she walked past Auntie Alice, she did n't even say good morning grandma good morning nan or anything.
And then she slopped herself down, got a fag and just about choked me and Auntie Alice out and then she did start to speak.
So well she obviously needs a fag and a cup of tea before she.
Well that was quar that was about twenty past eleven.
was still in bed.
Well Auntie Alice said you ca n't wonder they stay in bed.
She said they bought theirselves a a bottle of brandy last night and erm.
some Babycham and she said they'd sat there and drank a bottle of brandy and Babycham all night she said.
Well they have erm three bottles of lager on a Saturday night and they're them big bottles like that, you know them plastic bottles?
Three bottles they drink between the two of them.
Could n't you think of that?
We had, that's like we had a letter the other day we had to sign for Jonathan.
That and I said to Geoff what's D O B?
Yeah.
Dob.
Yeah well I I said to Geoff I thought about it, but I did that come to me quite quickly but Geoff could n't think of it could you Geoff?

Yeah.

Jonathan.
I'm trying to talk to nanny.
Er ninety one pound in there.
And you could n't really see much what we'd got, could you Geoff?
But we had eighty one pounds in stamps.
So that helped out a lot.
That used to be for.
Yeah it was forty seven.
Now it's sixty two.
I said this, thi this next year I'm gon na try and m make no end of jam.
Cos Geoff only eats strawberry well I oughta make it all really cos that'd be far cheaper would n't it?

I was quite convinced it was quite alright.
And er he comes home at half past three and he then sort of told us what we'd got to do in it.
Well if you'd have looked him Brian you could of told what sort of.

So you've got ta co you've got ta cancel that then, cos she might have to pay.
Yeah but you ought to let them know.
Or whoever is.
Well I should leave it till the weekend things could change.
Whatever's the matter with the girl?
So there's Julie, Ian and James are n't gon na go to the meal at all?
So.
Well why ca n't if John and Jim ai n't gon na go Marie's not gon na go, why ca n't Cheryl still go and then.
So she's gon na have a he heavy work.
again?
But that's got nothing to do with it!
Well I.
That's mucked your plans up as well innit?
Cos you.
all enjoy going together.
I'll tell you something, why do n't you go and invite Carole and Brian?
Well I would, I should go up there and have a word with Carole and Brian cos they sit on their own all christmas virtually!
They do well last year they had egg and chips!
They.
they tried to go out for a meal, I do n't know whether it was christmas day or boxing day down in and they could n't get n in nowhere, I said well you would n't on a boxing day!
Yeah.
So is Gill going with you?
Oh no!
Well a yeah it's nice for Gill really cos he do n't enjoy it.
Oh well!
But then you ca n't in.
Yeah well then that's gon na be awkward really if you invite Carole and Brian and then just dump them off ai n't it?
Do you see what I'm.
Oh what a.
Oh what a shame!
Yeah but they ma they make.
You do n't know when Nick's well her mother do n't come christmas!
No!
What.
Oh they have to bring.
Yeah and then if I ca n't.
bloody go, yeah that's right.
Well that's embarrassing for you to do that though wo n't it?
Well I I know where I am so I ai n't got ta worry but boxing day we're going to well I was going to mum's I'll come up and see you boxing day though.
Like I normally do.
Well we're going to mum's but Geoff said well I I hate them cos Bobby and Pam are going I think this year he said well if I get fed up doing that evening he said I'll come home early.
So I said oh fair enough, I do n't mind.
That's entirely up to him what we do but I shall be up for dinner you know and sort of see you and then if Geoff wants to leave early, we will.
Yeah.
yeah.
Oh that's no good is it?
But.
but you can go straight for the meal, straight round hers.
and then is she coming back to you at all?
We will they?
Yeah well even if they came sort of late afternoon, turn up about fiveish and had a a bit of tea and then spent the evening with you that wo n't be too bad would it?
Well that's ridiculous!
What's the matter with it?
Well what's does he he just shows her how to.
Well innit ridiculous!
I better go in a minute.
Well you see children need routine really, you need to get into a routine, when you get into that.
Well he would n't be would he?
Yeah and that.
Well that's gon na wear her, that's gon na make her ill.
Well what.
But it's silly to let a baby rule your life ai n't it?
I mean or anyway, it is n't her baby is it?
I know it's her grandson but.
Well she had erm Sam one night did n't she?
Oh I bet she did, I bet she did n't treat him like that!
Did she really!
Good heavens!
Well if I'd have known, I'd have had it!
No but you do n't you do n't do that sort of thing.
No.
Well then that's her fault is n't it?
What can you do about that?
Well I think really if he's if he's.
got ta say to her and now you got ta stand on your own two feet everything we do you keep changing so.
Well look.
No.
Well they do get like that.
at that age do n't they?
No.
Well that's a disappointment for you Val is n't it when you get?
The whole thing!
Because let's face it Val she is a type of person, you get her in a party or anywhere you know you're gon na enjoy yourself.
I know she thinks says things you know she embarrasses me at times.
but I know you know if she's there you're gon na have a good time.
You know erm and I if she if she goes to emba cos I think she does it for the purpose really to people.
she tries to embarrass.
them you know.
I try to ignore her, if I can wha.

I did n't know Julia had n't been in for a long while.
She'd erm was erm getting a pie out the oven and cos some of the juice went on the floor, she wiped it up thinking she'd wiped it up properly and she did n't, she slipped, she's broken a couple of bones in her foot.

She has n't been there for about a month.
I suppose she must have her foot in plaster.
Well I see him walking about the other day!
Oh.
Has he?
Well I seen her at even the other day.
I think it might have been Saturday possibly.
Well he goes up to do his shopping do n't he, in town.
and walk up.
What does he do for Christmas Geoff?
Cos he's got a son away has n't he?
Perhaps goes there?
Does he?
That must be a lonely old life for him living there all on his own.
What happened to his mum?.
His wife.
Oh I do n't know!
I thought she was dead or something!
Oh I dunno.
Married someone else.
Oh!
Perhaps it was her.
Oh crumbs!
And thi and this.
They did n't!
Yeah cos he's a nice little man ai n't he?
Yeah ever so harmless little fellah.
What about what Brian said last night?
About, cos that man was sitting outside May.
He were n't sitting outside her house at all, he was sitting up here!
Oh well he might of done, yeah.
They're paranoid for people breaking.
in ar n't they.
I was telling Sue about it, oh my God she said!
She said well they did n't look the type, I was going well now.
quite honestly he did n't!
I said and he's quite and inoffe i inoffensive little man he was a nice little man.
Well yeah, but he was a nice little man.
He knew what he was talking about.
No, none at all.
Ooh I rang the club and sorted that out, done.
that.
So she said well do n't do n't put them down again I'm doing it by the computer.
So I said well do I get the things now?
So she said well no cos she said you're you're in the re in arrears a bit.
Ooh I said, oh have I?
It ai n't a lot!
So she said I'll do it on the computer and and I'll let you know so we're eighty pound behind well course we never sent one month at all!
No!
So we got behind So I said well we'll tr I'll try and get caught up sort of, in the new year you know, get them a bit.
Actually I think I'm gon na finish that catalogue anyway I'm just.
Grattan.
And just have the other one cos they're such a peculiar funny firm they are!
So I explained to them, I said well that's cos you changed over and I sort of never put it across through oh she said well do n't worry I've done it now, she said you have n't got anything to worry about now, I said well it did bother me a bit to think that I did n't think you had my payment!
Oh yes she said, we've had it I thought well why send me letters, then!
Well that's what she said, that's a standard letter.
Well you get some little old dear what runs the.
catalogue to.
get a little bit of pocket money or that's the only way she can get anything!
Oh they're out in that car again out there.
Damn!
They're up to the roof are n't they?
What's.
I did n't think Sarah did n't go to the ol lo oh had oh I would n't of thought that was a pair,.
Well Val was telling me Caroline got the kids all in a row and said something about erm you know, more or less to say well I want to leave your father she said.
what do you think about it Sam?
And he just put his head down.
And what do you think about it Erica?
And she burst into tears!
And what do you think about it erm what did I say the other one's name was?
Which one did I say?
That'll be Ben the oldest.
No it was Sam.
Yeah well anyway the other one.
he said well I think that's the best you can do father, he said we've had enough hassle for you for all these years!
So she said quite right, she said he's done nothing but bully you lot ever since you've been children!
So she said and I felt very proud of my son, ah I said I would n't want a son of mine who said that to his father!
I would n't of wanted it.
Yeah but all said and done Geoff, they are his fa, he is their father.
He you know what a big head he is.
Well she said he he's done nothing but bully them.
Well you heard what he said he wants his children to have a good education and he pushes them all the time, they've got ta if they do anything.
they've got ta be brilliant at it But.
you see some children ai n't got it in them and you know.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Well, to me if a child has got a by all means encourage along but you should n't push them into anything cos later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything you know if they.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gon na do well and.
Well I do it all look at it's the way you say it.
Well yeah but I would n't.
Well would you like your son to say I think.
Well no.
But he's always been like that with them kids you know yourself if they do anything it's got ta be done.
They've all gone off to Fiji.
The parents, he said he was going did n't he?
So she said, Val said I thought good for you mate, you did n't get pushed out he's gone they're all gone till the new year innit?
Well I would n't of wanted to go with them myself.
I would n't of thought so I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a I do n't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway and her sister said is she had n't got enough money, she'd pay for it.
That's right that's what Val told me.
What?
Who has n't her sister?
No she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well yeah.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff I do n't think he.
means any harm, that's his way.
Well he's always been pleasant to me you got ta.
Well I find her boring.
I find her very boring although she's a very kind person.
I'm surprised you know, she is n't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been.
like this that's it.
Well she hates him!
She literally hates him!
Well I think that's awful I do.
Well she might as well get rid of him now, I suppose while she's young enough to find perhaps find.
somebody else.
Well whatev whatever's all this big house in aid of then?
I bet they're gon na build it and sell it!
Well yeah, I would've thought so because le.
Well let's face it erm he's got a, a half a half a right to it.
He's worked hard, he's worked he ai n't he does work, when he works.
Well I dunno.
And he does it now does he?
You never see that erm do you?
Well yeah cos when you think like that if they do pack up he's got no no nothing.
Well not unless they they do n't sell that house well look at poor old Dick!
Yeah but he's still got ta have a home to live in Geoff!
Well that's like er.
but then they've got er er said they they asked if they could rent his house off him until they got themselves sorted out.
No bloody way he said!
I thought to myself well yo if Laura had a house and then thought Pete was in that in that position, I'd of helped him.
Yeah well they've had they've had a big today.

Well I thought she said I ai n't got ta then have they?
A hundred pou thous thousand in debt they had two lo two bloody great Morgan cars!
Well I reckon that's her either his mother or her mother.
Cos when I was coming home from Pete's a bloke stopped me er whatever's that noise?
A bloke stopped and he said er can you tell me where is?
I said well you're in the oh he said I'll tell you what I want, a little black and white house I said it's just there look I said nearly you're nearly on top!
He got a few yards down, he said so I said well have yo you have n't come round to view the house today have you?
Oh no he said, I said because they got a funeral on, he said that's what we've coming for, we're coming to pick granddad up.
Well I thought well I did n't want people going round there.
Well that was a waste of their time if they'd have gone round there to view them, were n't it?
So that was not having a lot of flipping luck is she?
But they have n't put them out their home.
Alright, but I think they've got ta re-house them first have n't they?
Well yeah they just shove you out on the street, they got ta especially if you got children they got ta re-house you.
But I dunno whatever's whatever's this bloody world coming to?
Well you never guess what she said today?
Well I wa she said I'm gon na start up drinking June I said you're not!
She said I bloody well am!
She said you can up and have one with me if you like sometimes, I said alright then.
She said well he's got his fags, she said I'm gon na start drinking!
I said well be warned Val!
She said I know when to stop, I thought yeah but.
Yeah but.
that.
Jonathan what are you doing?
Ooh and there's ooh something else happened as well!
She erm.
Sha Sharon's not going out with them now for Christmas.
Cos Marie's going in hospital having her operation.
She said and I'm not leaving her to you see!
But Val said them children them children have they manipulate her.
I thought well manipulates you Val.
So she said erm I'll bloody told her straight she said!
But she said there's Geoff worried sick about that old girl.
because he's said well she's go she's they got her this little place, did n't they?
Sorted it all out for her and carp it was all carpeted everything.
now she's gone and moved down in West.
But he Val said it was that flipping rough.
and the house is like a tip!
And she said Geoff kept saying to her oh I would n't move from where you are, you know you got your place lovely i if you the reason she moved was cos she wanted Tony to get the breakfast round What was said that's what Val said.
So she said the's go out with them do n't they?
What?
What does?
Well erm.
I did n't think Ken liked the woman.
Well Ken do n't like the woman anyway, does he?
Well I certainly would n't sit down at Christmas dinner with them that's why.
they're going.
And er Mervy.
And that's all now so Val said she said I said to Cheryl now do n't you go and take Mervy away cos me and Ken certainly are n't gon na go and sit sit with erm the's all dinner time so she said what they're gon na do, they're going out for the meal and everything and then they're Ken are gon na go to Cheryl's for the rest of the day So I said so that's upset your plans then Val she said is n't it just!
She said I've been really looking forward to it June.
Have a break looked like she gon na cry any second!
She said.
Do you know me and Ted have been married thirty year no not thirty, they've been going out together thirty years.
then she said do you know these last six months we do nothing but argue she said we've never argued so much!
And she said oh I think it's only the pressure.
I said well me and Geoff argue more, I said we never used to cos we never argued a lot did we?
Well we have done I felt sorry cos I had n't really when she phoned me up over there I was up I thought oh my God!
Cos I'm a bit worried we got ta get things sorted out so I rang I said I did n't to get onto you, she said no I know how they feel she said her granddad always do things like that.
You know break appointments I said well that only worries.
well I said I suppose Geoff could n't get away.
I said that that worried m that really sort of worried me so I rung her back anyway, she's alright.
But you must go Wednesday Geoff!
And she been.
Yeah.
So you could of gone to that appointment tonight?
Yeah well you ca n't go there not washed and changed.
But you got an appointment fo you could of had one for tomorrow but I thought Wednesday is a better day I thought.
Why erm why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Not hygiene sort of thing?
Mhm.
It's got ta go on a special one?
I'm surprised they use wood.
Yeah I suppose they would, yeah.
Do they?
Bloody hell!
Well then that is, that's got ta be sorted out because if you.
had a fire there, somebody would n't get out properly!
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
How would you get out?
Yeah well what about if the fire's between the box room and this exit?
Where are you going?
What ab oi!
Do n't ask then!
I mean I wo n't even talk to myself am I?
I did n't tell your mum that I'd got it on you see she said now all that I've been saying!
So I said well no, no they wo n't take no notice of that, I said anyone that's been.
I said they ai n't gon na say ooh that's Val on there, I said the.
What is it?
In Cambridge got something to do with, what was that he said?
Well anyway something about University you know all these studies they do.
Geoff and Joan thought erm someone was trying to rob us along here!
Poor little man!
I said I do n't know what hollering for, he's got a bloody.
rottweiller there!
Oh yeah.
But how pathetic!
yeah.

Well I can never understand him.
If we ought to had him mate they'd have thought he'd come from.
another planet!
No I must admit I ca n't.
And did you get it right?
Yeah.
She got those to.
I like her hair tha that colour do you Geoff?
No!
No.
Well that's cos it's always been so light.
is n't it?
Ah I like it I knew there was something.
different to me have a at least when you have it down Sarah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
is n't you really?
Yeah I think you do feel tidy if your hair's off your face.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
I wonder where you find one of them from?
Well they must do them Sarah, must n't they?
Mm where's a?
Yeah.
And or perhaps a real sort of top hairdresser, they might have them they sometimes have bits and.
pieces do n't they?
Well that used to be all the rage once, did n't it?
Oh yeah!
O yeah.
No.
You're not!
You want a change?
How.
was you thinking of having it cut?
What short short?
No so short.
short hair would suit you cos you have n't got it all over your face have you?
Yeah.
Well I think if that was me I'd have that done now in case you do n't like it by the time you you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh.
you'd have it cut after?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah I do do you know I do n't like to see brides with their hair down if you've got long hair i.
but I do n't think sometimes I think well if it looks nice but some of them brides on there that just hangs do n't it?
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
Oh that's sounds nice!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you'll have to have it done a couple of times.
sort of try two or three styles then sort of how well you got ta think about your headdress and that first, have n't you?
What you're gon na have and then pu guide your hairstyle to go with it we or.
or your wearing wha.
well, yeah.
What you be doing in the new year Sarah?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah but you are n't.
you have n't got a white skin Sarah have you?
You've got a sort of a bit of an olivy skin have n't you?
Yeah so you will have time to.
get a.
tan wo n't you?
You'll have time to do that.
No.
You're right yeah.
Yeah.
Will you have your bridesmaids dresses made?
Had you thought about your bridesmaids yet?
Oh are you!
Yeah.
What?
Oh.
So you want another little one?
Are you having any page boys?
Well did n't you just have.
Why do n't you have the.
with the page boy?
Instead of having another bridesmaid, have a page boy and so the two little ones go up together page boy.
and erm bridesmaid and then have your bridesmaids behind.
I think that'd look nice.
a little boy and a little girl together.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh I think that'll be nice!
Yeah.
Then you have n't got ta worry about finding another one.
Could n't you?
Well, Jonathan do n't do that while that's on because it ai n't no good doing it!
Well yeah get over Christmas and then you can start sorting yourself out really.
Mm that's right.
There's just a lot to think about is n't there?
Yeah cos tha once Christmas is here, that'll soon come wo n't it?
Jonathan goes to soon.
Next.
Yep.
And wo n't you Sarah?
You get the first week will seem a bit strange but once you get the first week over you're alright then.
And you're working.
Hopefully.
Well yeah, if he can get a job that is!
How the job situation is these days!
He ca n't a job.
Well he's a labourer really.
He erm, he did n't have a job for two weeks!
He said he ca n't get unemploym erm the dole or nothing cos he's self employed!
What?
Twelve is it?
He ca n't get any money se so so he ca n't get erm what do you call it?
Social security.
if you've got money in the bank!
Well I said that's terrible that our boy should suffer because he's got money in the bank, and saved his money!
He's got ta live off his ear off his money ai n't he?
Well he is n't certainly gon na dwindle.
Too right Sarah!
Yeah that's right!
I said you're paid the same.
Well I ai n't got any but they wo n't give me any!
Well Well I think, I, I do n't think it pays you to save up er.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
You might.
as well enjoy your money as you go along, why bother to have any!
Why bother!
Well I certainly is n't going to, Sarah!
I shall get as much out the system as I can mate!
Well I told you that.
Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that.
He's.
Oh!
Yeah.
Then they pay a lot.
Terrible is n't it?
That's right it was n't.
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now.
Oh!
Phone Geoff!
Well that's like there's jobs like.
your dad and Geoff they pay a stamp at Turners do n't they?
They still have to pay a self employed one as well you know?
I did n't know whether your dad knew that?
You still have to pay it back, I said well I do n't think you should have to pay it back!
Yeah.
Well yeah, Geoff would n't be there if i if his business was running alright!
Well I said I do n't think that's to e you should pay two stamps myself!
Like bloody!
I feel like giving him away but I do n't know whether I would, but I feel like it.
I'm surprised someone has n't.
Which erm relative of's has died?
Well I reckon that's her mother or his mother.
Mm.
Yeah because erm as we come home from work these two sort of big saloon cars, black ones sort of come up, mourning cars I suppose you call them and they stopped at's and picked a load of people up.
No!
But you mean, no not them Jonathan!
And then as we was coming home from Pete's, a chap stopped us and asked us where was so I told him where was he said I'm looking for a little black and white house I said it's right there look!
He was right up to it so I said well I do n't know whether you're going round to view the house cos that's on the market are n't they?
cos I said erm no I have n't actually, stop cos I said that.
they got a death in the family today and then he said that's what we've come, we've coming to pick up granddad, so I reckon that is.
her mother or his.
No!
No!
There was some smart cars round there today.
Well I said they have n't had the house yet!
I bet that that's pretty as well.
have n't you?
When I said, I think that's wrong!
Well we have!
Why have you got it?
You have n't got to pay it?
What about that last lot?
Well you have n't paid it.
Well you ca n't stop paying it now.
Ooh good!
Ah but perhaps Ken's the same as you then?
Cos I should n't think he's made any profit.
Well you had a loss.
So a I said it's a shock.
we did n't know you see, well Geoff paid it last year, well he di he di he did n't have to!
Yeah we have.
Yeah made a fortune did n't they?
And now he's nowhere earning.
nowhere near that amount.
Mm.
He's halved them wages.
has he?
But I mean I I would n't even mind earning two hundred a fifty a week.
Yeah.

But then you want it.
They.
So you're gon na get tax back as well, like you was told?
Gon na get that back so I mean all these little bits.
everybody else.

Oh she actually told her then?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah Does she do any hairdressing yet or?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.

That family has more handouts than anybody I know!
And the, what is the the thing what annoys me is they're working!
That is what annoys about it or fair enough if they have n't got any money they get these handouts but when they're working and they still get them that's when I think it's wrong!
Well course we are!
My mo, I think my motto's gon na be, see if you ca n't beat them, join them!
Been funny?
And then they get divorced!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you saved hard for it, so then why should n't you have it?
That's what.
you want to do with your money.
that's up to you.
He's important.
Sarah!
About as big as your dad's bungalow!
If you look round here cos he's right.
opposite us.
He put.
Well he's.
I said to Geoff when you get your footings in they do you think to yourself, cor that ai n't gon na be very big!

With who?
Why?

They fell over.
Ooh Christ!
Oh!

Well then what did he say?
Well he must of had that amount he must be contin, he must have alcohol in the body continuously.
So he never gets over it does he?

Well he's gon na kill his self is n't he?
Anyway he's just rotting his bowel, he'll be rotting his liver next!
And what did he say?
Nothing.

Well I still alcohol.

And then there's Andy as well.

Let me cross her out and put fifteen in there.
Thirty five, that's there.
Right?
Then the's want you to fill the bus up with petrol.
They're a hundred and seventy miles.
Well I'm sure that's why I've put that there look, that's the same colour pen no one else is got anything so it is them.
Erm, I think she's bringing that back erm early hours of the morning, at.
twelve, about twelve o'clock.
So, but what I'm saying is you've got a twelve here and oh well that would n't make no difference cos she'll have that back, that'll be ready for them na yeah well then we got a twelve there as well!
That's what, that's what I was trying to tell you.

I'm hoping your not gon na be home too late.
Well see Carole and them are bringing that back tonight at her erm his son is gon na come back and then.
they're gon na leave that here.
so if I get up there and do it early in the morning, well it do n't get light till half seven.
well I could do that first I think before I do anything else so that'll mean I've got to do so that if the long is clean.
Is it filthy then?
Oh get off, sorry darling.

So I shall have to ring her tonight when I get home, see how she.
got on with him.
Well I rang mum.
but she were n't there so, whether and then I rang down Susan's, I thought they might be there but nobody answered the phone, so I thought well.
But that's a shame when they do n't like it is n't it?
But Susan said last time he disrupted all the other cats and dogs!
Said he ma he makes, she said he makes such a funny noise!
But you see he do n't like being caged i she said if you sit.

Mm yeah but I should think they're insured for that.
Well yeah.
Hey what are they doing?

We are in arrears but we're gon na be.
Yeah it worked out what, about nine hundred pound innit?
Well you see nine hundred pound that's only sort of your half yearly rent is it?
So we we're not.
Yeah we pay that for a year.
That's a bloody good job that is all it is!
Cos I did n't know how we'd of managed if we'd had a big one!
But he said to Geoff do n't pay it off all in one lump sum.
He told him not to do that, he said just pay when you got some and.
pa, pay what you can so it gets it down.
so you're catching up.
but do n't go and pay it all off.
You're mum's worried she has n't paid any poll tax since August!
She has n't had a form or nothing!
I said we'll worry about it when it comes!
But she do n't want to get what we've had, she's got ta pay it in advance.
Jonathan!
Put your feet down!
Put your feet down!

Yeah but.
I think it's wrong!
Well do n't, if that child does n't want to do it, I think that's wrong to make her.
Well she has n't!
He said it's tha, that is what he said if you do n't want to do it, you do n't have to!
Well she's got something.
Well then how's she bloody done it?

Cos they had shopping you see.
Money's not everything.
I'd like to have a little bit more but I.
do n't make, I do n't, I would n't want to be.
Well I always consider me and Geoff worked along, so far.

I'd work a lot less if I could.
Mm.
Well yes, that's right.

Oh no!
Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah.
Have you cleaned your brass grandma?
Looks shiny!

Anyway the tickets were twenty five pence each, so we all had one at work and you'd got ta guess.
No, Jenny bought them.
You got ta guess the weight of this Christmas pudding that's a great big Christmas pudding, and they tell you how many j erm jars of this and how many tins of that and how many pounds of sugar and and you've got ta guess the weight.
And the first prize is two hundred and fifty pounds worth of carpet.

You just.
Mm.

He's always wanted a.
Do you remember that time you and James and Marie had Julian's.
And nearly hit the police car.

But i.
Who?
What's the matter with him?
And they nearly hit it.
No do n't put them near the table!
Oh good.
There's nothing worse than stomach ache.
though.
is there?
No you must n't do do n't.
is n't he he's eating hot bread is n't he?
Geoff's.
been trying to look for a bit of paper and I opened a book today and found it!
What you done?
Oh ey.
Well he lived like a millionaire an.
lived like erm.
lived like erm royalty and he'd got no money had he?
I'm at work.
Just a minute!
Can they?
Ooh we better make sure we pay ours on time then.
Yeah that's a bit of a worry, the rent, is n't it.
for you?
There are n't many people say that nowadays.
is there?
No do n't be silly!
I bet she is.
He do n't want to.
I do n't like him Geoff!
That dark haired one.
I do n't like him!
Ooh no that's the dark one.
I'm not keen on him.
A biggish feller, with dark hair.
Well fairly tall, fairly sort of stocky build.
No.
Well this is her is it her brother, is?
We only found that out the other day!
A Pogey.
Well that policem that police woman was telling us about Southall Road di.
were n't she?
She's ever.
so nice, she lives in the village, she's erm what is she, Indian or something?
or.
Yes but.
She lived in Walton Pier.
In them bungalows, little bungalows.
Well she co and cor, do you know she'd got beautiful nails!
Yeah I could n't really help no, I thought to myself ooh my God, I put mine like that!
But, she was extremely nice.
were n't she Geoff?
Get your shirt on.
Oh!
Oh!
I said to her.
I said I do n't mind this doing statement, I said, but I am not going to court!
So she said well I'll put that on the thing, but she said if it goes to Crown Court you'll have to, I said well.
they'll have to take me, I said but I'm not going.
Erm.
No, who was that I'd got ta a statement about then?

Yeah.
Well I said Geoff might have to go to that because he was driving Geoff's car, if I remember rightly!
Without us knowing, were n't he?
No!
She did, and he drove it!
Alan said another bugger!
They're all at it!
I said I ta.
Well that's a funny thing.
that's a funny thing on the phone when he said about paying I said a hundred a six pound complete so I said and do n't give me a cheque cos I do n't want one!
Do you know where was he gon na pay the money from?
If he ai n't got it!
He thought he was gon na have it on tip again I think.
Well we all see the other tenner but that do n't make any difference, as long as we got the main.
Well what have.
we got ta say if he comes to want to hire a car?
No?
No.
He wo n't get one off of me!
I shall say to him you was rude to my mother-in-law and.
that's it!
But i, I do n't think he can go to anybody else.
I think that's why he comes here cos nobody.
else wants to entertain him.
Well he told me he nearly strangled him!
No, Healey.
No he said, I ca n't bear him, he said I nearly bloody strangled him!
I thought to myself it's a pity someone did n't strangle you mate!
They should n't really should they?
Yeah you're wise to lock it really.
He's a rough and ready man is n't he?
Mind you, your money's always there.
and you know where you stand with him.
Who paid for that then Geoff?
Good God, that's good innit?
Who's his solicitor, I think we ought to get in contact with him?
Yeah.
that's what I was saying about Geoff's car really you know that chap taking it and righting off and we did n't got a penny for it, I ca, I ca n't see how that's right!
Well that's it!
Well erm.
well I suppose their motto is, she had a C D ten on her driving licence, I suppose she should n't of had it in the first place so if she had n't of had it, he would n't of got it!
But that still ai n't the point!
Geoff did not.
hire it to him!
He hired it to her whether she'd got a C D ten.
yeah but if she'd of had the accident they could of said no, she's got a C D ten on her driving licence, she should n't have been driving it!
Well fair comment.
But he were n't even supposed to have it, so.
that ma, I said to Geoff, to me, you know, we'd like to get a solicitor on it but you see we.
No!
Oh well she.
Well I tell you something, I think you ought to compile a letter together to somebody, and try and sort some it is n't gon na cost you nothing to write a letter!
Well I do n't know who!
I just do n't know what to think!
I do n't know who well I do n't know whether you ought to write to the chief constable and explain the situation, all the.
aggro we've had of and forms and then writing letters to him.
and being lost and.
Well that would n't of helped i.
And somebody taking them!
She di, she did n't ha.
The car was at home.
And he took it.
Yeah but then he knew he had.
No she left the keys in the house.
Yeah but you do n't t, if you're not using the car.
you do n't carry a well a.
And he picked it up.
Well that's it, as far as I'm concerned, it's theft!
And that is all.
And he was convicted of theft!
Well course it is!
Well then yo, you should have rung her up and said did he break in the caravan?
She should of said yes, and then we perhaps would of got paid out!
Yeah but she'd kicked him out anyway, had n't she?
Well that's a pity she ai n't said she had!
Well I'd I'd I just can not see how it's fair!
Until you want paying out!
Well that's a different sort of kettle of fish.
Well that's bloody right, yo.
Well I'd.
Yeah.
Bloody hell!
Ooh!
With.
With all this er.

All the po the population, you'd think blimey there must be billions.

Mind you ca n't mana well I suppose you could manage without it but that would n't be so easy would it?
Well yeah.

I shall have to talk to myself Jonathan!

Well who else is myself?
If that is n't me!

Who was that?
Ooh crumbs!
What sort of plays?
Well I, it would n't worry you, you are n't gon na be there!
What you mean, play time?
Well that's hardly fair if you did n't do it!
Who did it?
Who do you think did it?
Well I think the person's very selfish not to own up.
Who Jeremy.
I would n't be surprised!
Well that is n't very fair on the rest of you though is it?
Matthew did n't do it.

No.
I've no idea Jonathan I'm not looking.

He's had to go and get a battery.
for the minibus.
I'll tell you what you can do on the freezer there's some cat food for the cat you can feed him that.
No not all of it!
I do n't know how that tin got left out there.
And then you can bring yourself a couple of pizzas in.
Yes you can, they're on the top, you reached them the other night.
Will you please try them?
Oh go on Jonathan!
Why does it hurt your belly?
Well how do you think mum does, she is n't half much taller than you anyway!
Yeah.
Stay in there Jonathan cos.

Pardon?

I certainly would n't like it.
Ca n't smell in that.
Hurry up!
No I ai n't gon na talk to myself!
I ca n't you berk, you're right outside the door!
Well I'm not really keen on having a box of Lego on the dinner table.
Well I do n't really think it's right do you?
Well I do n't!
I hope dad's not gon na be too late.

He's always late, that is true.
Oh God!
There goes the phone.

No I could do with a lot more.
That is the more I think about it though.

Cos she erm she's throws a wobbly quite often do n't she?
Is she like that in class?
Is She?

I should n't think, she hates Mrs do n't she?
Yeah, I dunno why.
Why?
Well Mrs only tells her off when she's naughty.
I know she's not the most popular person, but she is.
right a lot of the time.
Well not all the time, nobody's right all the time, but she is a right she is right a lot of the time Jonathan because some of them children misbehave.

It says a Christmas service will be held in the oh no it is n't the juniors are now helping the infants with their nativity story on Wednesday the eighteenth of December this was originally a advertised, by me, at taking place at six thirty in Walton St. Peter Church, I'm afraid this was a mistake on my part, as in fact the performance is rather ten thirty on the da on that day at Walter St. Andrew Church.
This timing will enable even the youngest children to take part.
Mum'll go to that cos I like carols.
Well course you are going to it!
Why?

Erm.

Well I'll leave I ca n't wait any longer, I'm hungry.
Mr went to the dentist this morning did n't he?
Who did you have teaching you this morning then?
Well part of the morning, who taught you this morning?
I thought you said he went to the dentist?
Which classroom was he in then?
Oh he's gone back in his own classroom now has he?
You need a lot of teachers do n't you?
What teacher do you like the best?
Do you?
Well you ca n't have it, you've eaten yours!
Have it next time.

What?
Oh!
Why?
No she went to the dentist instead, I mean the hospital.
Mm.
Have, enough of her Jonathan.
Is it?
Yeah but she's diabetic.
Yeah but she's under anaesthetic.
But she has to cos she's a diabetic.
Mm just a sec.
Here's comes your dad.
I should think.
to his stuff.
They want it about eleven but I said, can you get down to get it?
Because your dad wo n't be there, will he?
I have a your dad can.
And also that young chap's been here for the van.
It was a nice little feller.
or anything like that.
Dunno!
Got jeans on him.
He had another boy with him might.
I dunno.
Mm.
Yeah.
Where's your other half then?
not needed, give me that half.
Oh I thought you was on about the pie.
They ai n't got a lot of flavour have they?
I've done all inside that van.
Just got ta wash the outside.
Yeah, cos it's Sun, Saturday.
Ooh crumbs!
What are you gon na say to him?
Well he's moving furniture as well.
Yeah but he must bring it back by nine!
I forgot Mr was having it.
So your mum wo n't be able.
to go shopping till nine then?
Well they do n't normally go till about nine anyway well they ca n't cos the post office do n't open till do you want a coffee?
Do you know I've been so busy, I done that van this morning, I've done my housework and two loads of washing been over Petes ' did I tell you?
rang you?
Do you the pies?
Make a change did n't it?
I quite like them.
Not a lot of meat in them though is there?
Them ones we got from.
Posted them letters did you?
Where are they?
Well I'd have done them myself!
We ai n't heard a word from Jimmy have we?
Pardon?
Why, what you got ta do?
But to work this morning, I could of done it!
I said take the bus.
Yeah but I could of when I got home!
Now I've got ta do it in the dark!
Well the hoover wo n't, except I had to scrub that mini that erm that van, it was so filthy!
And now who?
Jimmy did.
I wonder where he's getting his vehicles from this week?
I thought you said they stopped the?
Bloody ridiculous that man!
So someone bought the bailiffs in for sixty two quid!
Who's A T S?
You do n't owe them nothing do you, I hope?
Precisely for that reason I should think!
Oh.
So this is is n't what it's all about?
Oh.
That's ridiculous innit?
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
Well why do n't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?
Well that's a ridiculous thing to do!
Well they say they're gon na put you into court, you get it paid do n't you, before anything goes further?
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Cor!
My God!
For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!
They obviously do n't like him do they?
Perhaps it's.
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now is n't he?
It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen.
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make is n't he?
Who did pay the insurance?
Well I should think so, gon na get twenty two grand out of it!
Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he did n't even pay it, I did!
Yeah but I do n't think that's gon na be such an easy case to.
You know it looks to me.
they think that it's all cut and dry, well they have n't got the then people will come round and investigate yet!
Well I ca n't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Do n't be silly!
Jonathan put that straight in the bin for mum, will you please?
Yeah.
, they're going to Yarmouth.
that's where they're going cos he said they he's not actually for the itself.
it's you know, for the workers, they're going out on a meal.
He is gon na pay his self.
Yeah.
Well I presume so.
He ought to have done it through the college got it cheaper.
He said this is nothing to do with the college.
Well I suppose he's, the man's got his reasons.
Yeah cos you got ta lay out money are n't you?
Oh he said, when he's finished I do n't whether he's not picking it up till later on.
Ooh and another that's what I wanted to tell you about well I do n't think we can help him out.
Gentleman wanted a minibus.
now, he talked rather nice erm with having four.
I ca n't remember his name at all I can I ca n't think of it now.
Well what he wanted, he wanted a minibus from there to there and there well we ca n't can we?
We can have one from there to there but he ca n't have one here.
Can he?
Just a minute Jonathan, let mum because the college has got one there.
Toby's got one there and got the other one there.
Well what time is Toby coming back?
Well so he ca n't have that one then?
And the Isle of Ely college is going out for a meal, so that wo n't be back, so he ca n't have that one, so we have n't got one!
For Friday night, but he can have one sort of, first thing Saturday morning.
But otherwise we have n't got one.
erm, and that lady's gon na ring about the Fiesta.
and then that young boy's gon na ring about the van.
But that means that wo n't get cleaned outside for Mr.
Mr.
Well but it's very clean inside, I scrubbed it.
And polished it.
I would n't of thought he'd of worried too much about the outside.
Well it is n't that bad, it's only down the bottom anyway.
I did!
Well that's got ta be back by nine in the morning.
As long as he's got that back in the yard by nine.
Well I did see him, he seemed alright but you see you ca n't tell what people are like, yo you may think they have ni.
nice personalities but he could now do a runner with our van could n't they?
I reckon that's what honky tonk was on the other night though.
I reckon he's in trouble.
So well, he could have the van well how much would you charge him for tonight?
Yeah cos Mr's got the Renault.
Oh in decent state he did n't last time I scrubbed well I wou.
No.
Yeah well they sho I said I'd I was looking through this.
and I was thinking cor we say we have n't been doing very well, but look at that week there!
And then look it's not.
too bad for this time of I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last.
Well you see you do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one or was that clean before we put it in the shed?
Erm, I should imagine so.
Yes, she is.
Do n't she like the column change?
Oh God!
Well you'll just have to explain to her, the other one.
has n't come back after you've.
Well I do n't know what time she's picking it up at actually.
I should imagine that's his number.
I hope he paid you this week then.
Well you with his money you can pay off them two bills.
Cos yo you do n't put them through do you?
His?
Have you.
put any on?
Well then forget about this time, that wo n't hurt will it?
We've been doing alright otherwise.
Pete was talking about his Roly he said June, he said he is such a character!
So I said, is he?
So he he's been up he's one of type of dogs, he said like a human you would n't know if he went in the house they would n't know whether he was coming out with a double barrelled shot gun to shoot yourself or.
with a glass of sherry in his hand!
He said he's.
one of them types!
Pete was hoping they ai n't drunken no cider!
He must have had four glasses while I was there.
I should n't talk about him cos that's not nice and he said, I said to him.
They must both drink.
They're not even afford it.
Whatever for this time!
Well I thought he did n't go down there any more?
She did n't!
Well I suppose it does make him feel uncomfortable.
Yeah he said I've forgotten about it Blue's forgotten about it he said, but she wo n't let it rest he said he said it's Well she's a child, she's only a child Geoff that's.
why.
She's like a spoilt child, she's got ta learn to.
from there soon.
Well I suppose it probably was n't tha, a complete pack of lies Geoff.
So you've got ta be the one who tells him.
Well I think he's right.
Jonathan!
Well that's right.
Well that is right innit?
But she's like a child really you got ta pity her really have n't you?
But the point is, why should other people suffer her.
You know, they should n't have to should they?
All that worrying!
My best friend's lost his father and he said well I lay awake all last night thinking about it.
Well I thought.
