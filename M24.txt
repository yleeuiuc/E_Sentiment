
I do n't know.
He did n't seem to know what they were in there for.
Well you can listen to what you've taped with the headphones.
You can listen to what you've taped.
You can play it back yeah, if you want to.
I do n't think you can do that.
To say I've had it, yeah.
Next Friday.
Yes.
Er stick it in your t wherever, yeah.
Stick it where you like.
Stick it where you like.
No.
It's got erm it's own recording level.
Erm.
I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah.
I do n't suppose that matters really.
I wo n't have time now.
Are you?
There's no petrol in the car.
No I put it in the last two times.
Twenty quid's worth.
So you'll have you watch my little car.
Watch it.
Be careful.
I do n't suppose it is.
No.
Go the motorways though, if you can.
You'll have to watch for, for the roadworks.
I mean the roadworks on the M 6 are diabolical now.
Mm.
I it took us three and a half hours coming back from Swansea.
But we stopped off for half an hour as well.
And I think it's longer coming back that way.
Over the bridge.
No it is n't.
It is n't.
I'd be positive.
Shorter.
What was the mileage when we got there?
A hundred and eleven?
I ca n't remember now exactly.
Yeah well you could erm go up, go down the M 50 into Ross and then go from there.
Yeah, there is a oh to go back that way?
Yeah.
You could turn off for Abergavenny again.
So, where's she gone now?
They close at about four o'clock do n't they?
Well, Birmingham's on the cards cos Steve, Stevey-boy works there does n't he?
Pardon me?
How's Brian?
Me.
A bloke give me one.
Yeah.
It's on at the moment.
Some market research just to see how many times you swear at me.
Yeah.
So there will be er.
plenty on it.
Hey.
Who were you talking to?
What's what?
Oh yeah.
It's off the erm.
No, it's off.
It's off the toilet erm.
the vent.
I'll put it in the garage.
We wo n't lose it then.
It just slides on.
But the wind licked it off I suppose.
I'm definitely not putting it back on today, but I will put it back on.
Well.
On his car?
Shook it?
Upstairs, on the bed, vaseline on your nose.
Now.
Move it.
Go on.
Go upstairs.
Hurry up.
He's gone.
I've given her her hairdryer back on trial, I've told her.
If she leaves it plugged in and switched on again she wo n't get it back.
Because it ai n't on.
I ai n't having the house burnt down.
Bloody hairdryers.
Yeah, we do do n't we?
Yeah we do.
You are cheeky.
What about her food?
Tell Mary.
Tell Mary all about it.
Did you see them two dirty great big no right turn signs?
I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction?
He said you do n't, there's no right turn.
I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn.
I'd already gone that way twice.
And turned right.
Dog's looking at you.
What do you want Ricksy?
What is it Ricky?
Come on then..
I do n't see any I do n't I do n't see any bacon in there.

Oh.

Saturday Sunday.
Let's have some wh when?
I'll be up then.
I wo n't need it.
Okay.
No you did n't.
You bought dog food.
You bought milk.
You did.
You needed butter.
Alright.
Do n't you eat it.
Do n't you touch that butter.
Nor anybody else.
If you're saying you're buying the butter solely for me, then I just want me solely to eat it.
Cos I'm not carrying the can.
Brian, you're not to eat it.
No.
She says you had to go out and buy butter solely because I wanted it.
And I've.
I've had the bollocking cos we've had to buy butter.
And if you see her, see her eating our butter there will be a row.
you've said that.
Well neither am I.
He said he wants butter.
Yeah well sh I would n't have minded just for today.
I did n't s I I did n't say.
I did n't say I'd got to have it today.
Cos I do n't.
No I did not.
You s your suggestion was send Brian to the shops.
Not mine.
Well can you empty one of those and put it and put it in that bucket.
Thumping me probably wo n't come out on the tape.
So you dropped it.
You said you're not gon na believe this.
He'll eat that.
I'm not finished yet.
Tomorrow?
Okay.
I'll sort them out.
Got more in.
Shut up Rick.
He's crying his eyes out in there.
Three hundred and ninety pounds insurance.
I've got ta get that down a bit.
ten pound for the cover note.
You know just for.
three or four days.
Yeah.
You know while.
while the changeover has been done.
Got my registration number today.
One O two.
One O two two.
My new number.
W Y C or something.
No thanks Mary.
W Y C I think it is.
Yeah they've got O in them.
Or V.
At one time the V was only for, for commercial vehicles.
You know light vans and commercials but it's used for anything now.
You know our car's D V P.
Well it does hurt your pride.
I'm afraid we can not have any of this.
Too.
If it's wet just take your time.
Keep it upright.
Well you did n't realize it was going over did you?
It catches you by surprise.
It's run out.
Oh Wednesday.
Should n't be dripping.
Pressure's not high.
Pressure was down again this morning.
We must keep an eye on that.
Cos between one and two bar on the, on the erm boiler.
It means, means the system was n't pressurized.
But it could be very dangerous.
It's not right.
Yeah.
It should n't move.
The pressure's okay Mary.
Probably be alright to use the hot water system but not the heating.
Because it's a pressurized system.
So if you have a look and you ca n't see that needle.
Well it's changed now cos it's up now.
It's up now.
Er well it would have been.
There was no pressure on it.
Mm?
It should n't be.
It should be okay.
Yeah I was I had a shower, well, perhaps the water's been turned down a bit.
No I mean here.
On the boiler.
That water.
It's only one and a half.
It should be higher than that.
I'll put it up to two and a half and it should be warm enough there.
Well we'll have to watch that boiler.
They're fatal if we, if it.
Yeah.
Poor Rick.
My poor baby.
Aah!
Come, what did she do to you?
What have I got for you?
Hang on, hang on.
How much do you love me?
That much?
Okay.
You're only having little bits.
You're not having any bones or anything like that.
We'll have to keep it out, and use it.
Forty five minutes a side so it's erm.
Yeah, Saturday.
Well as many as possible.
That's what I mean.
We'll have to keep it out.
Somebody's put it away you see.
Yeah.
Oh I do n't doubt it.
There's only one person that commits the mortal sins.
Well I'm certain it begins with M.
Rick.
You're not having any rice.
No.
Where's all this paperwork?
Paperwork belongs to this.
Mary.
Mary.
I did n't want him to have that.
Mary.
Mary where's the paperwork belonging to that?
Oh that's some of it.
Have a, get it all out then Brian.
There's a book in there I've got ta fill in.
That's it.
That's it.
There does n't happen to be a pen in there does there?
Oh I see one.
I've no idea.
Yeah.
Have you made any tea Mary?
No.
Do you want some tea?
I told him to ring I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting.
Because there are jobs up on the notice board.
But he said Apex did n't know anything about it at the moment.
So I mean, if Apex do n't know anything about it I do n't know why they do n't.
Now you know I do n't get on with plastic.
Oh I got it first time.
I got it first time.
Tell her there will be half a pie for her tea otherwise she do n't get none.
I mean this is ridiculous.
It's making work for everybody.
And one thing we do n't want is extra work.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah but tell them to clean up after them.
Do n't leave it for you all the time.
No.
Well I mean that's different to the way we live though is n't it?
Mm?
Mm, could you imagine me.
No wonder he sits in the chair and does nothing.
Because they do it at home.
Eat that food now.
I've had enough of you.
You're being perfectly silly.
Yeah.
I remind me in the morning.
Yeah.
Eh?
Yeah.
Do n't put it away then Mary.
Do n't put it away, you'll have to leave it out for the week.
Seventeenth tomorrow is n't it Mary?
Seventeenth tomorrow?
I'll have to, I sha n't.
Yeah.
Phaw one twenty five.
Yeah.
Keep it in your pocket.
It's no good in the garage.
Okay.
Well I've got no change.
?
Do n't bank on it.
Yet again.
Oh, for taking the hairs off your legs?
I've got a razor upstairs.
Oh forget it, you can scrub that out straight away.
You'd be lucky to get one.
Where's the nearest loan company?
Where's the nearest loan company?
I know.
She.
When are you going to.
No, do n't get it till I want it to buy her present.
Good boy.
He said do n't buy any more new clothes.
Do n't buy any more new clothes.
What made her say that I wonder.
Which diet?
Your chocolate diet?
Your crisp diet or your food diet?
We know all about it.
We know.
Just buy me butter.
I sha n't encourage you to eat my butter.
nice cup of tea.
I dunno.
Yeah I should think so, yeah.
It's sure to.
We use all the words of the English language do n't we?
We use the yellow ones, the blue ones, the black ones.
George is, George is gon na get me some lights for on here, did you know?
George.
No, lights.
Yeah.
He makes them.
Well Lynwood do them.
So the next time he goes he's gon na get some for me.
He does he does ma a lot of manufacture for Lynwoods.
Yeah, good idea.
But we're not spending any money.
Mm.
It's only like a plaster of paris stuff is n't it?
It does go off quick.
Not very far.
Different designs.
That's right yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
It could definitely do with something.
But we'll leave it for now.
When, when he was in I saw he I saw Mark look at that corner.
And he copped off.
Goes in.
Goes in about an inch.
He was saying to me it was very difficult to do.
Well I ca n't understand why.
I mean really what he should have done if it, if it was that difficult he should have gone back another half a brick and the j bricked it up all the way.
level, instead of putting bits and pieces in.
Surely.
he could have half bricked it all the way up?
Instead of saying how difficult it was putting bits and pieces in.
I would have thought that's what I would have done.
You know, just come straight up with a row of bricks.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I mean it did n't have to be spot on.
As long as it came back out to where it is now.
Good boy.
But did you fart?
He probably farted.
You cheeky.
Good boy boys.
Go to sleep now.
Good boy.
Close your eyes.
That's it.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Go on go on.
Go on.
You soft animal.
Yeah.
In case he see in case he misses something.
I was gon na wash the car.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I've never.
seen it so dirty.
Eh?
It's not on it's not on the list.
You're not having it.
Forget it.
You are slow.
I do n't know.
As many as are full up.
Whether it be one, two ten fifteen, it does n't matter.
Erm every time you use a tape you fill in this is tape side B tape one side B tape two side A tape two side B.
No we're on one side B.
We've done side A.
Yeah.
When, what was the date we started recording on the tape?
Was it Saturday?
What date was last Saturday?
Fourteen fifte fourteenth?
No, well.
I have n't.
Well, you ca n't tell that I'm Irish but I can tell you're Irish.
You're you're a frigging idiot you are.
Nobody can.
Nobody can tell that I'm Irish.
Only when I swear.
And you know I do n't swear very often.
kids anyway.
But that could change when Patricia comes in.
Well I do n't think they have.
They have n't got a brummie accent, no.
And th th they have n't got a twang as far as I know anyway so.
I'm only putting the truth down as I see it.
You know?
I mean I could be wrong.
I can only put down what I know to be the truth as far as I can tell.
There does n't seem to be a regional accent in this area does there?
If you start going further towards Worcester, Worcestershire.
Into Worcester.
that that area.
Well, into Hailsowen.
places like that, then you would get an accent.
Mhm.
But I do n't look at Birmingham people.
Who?
when Brian?
Thought he'd be but he was n't. kids.
You'd better eat that food.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right I'll move the car then, out of his way.
Oh you've been to see him?
She has n't changed.
Sierra.
But not Greg?
Oh she work in a Dixons?
What full time?
Oh the estate agents.
Oh I see.
No.
You can do well in that job though.
You can be er kidnapped and all sorts.
You can do well in that job.
You can be kidnapped and all sorts.
Mm it must be at Cowley cos Connolly's virtually closed now.
What department's he in?
Dunno.
Oh.
A lot of them have you know.
Is that the one that rung Patricia?
Which one was that?
Oh.
I think, is in the er garage?
Did you go for your gauge then?
No.
You've got ta keep off them.
The white the white lines.
and manhole covers.
You've got ta find out where they are.
They make you change your line.
Well you have to sometimes.
You'll get used to it and it does n't affect you.
after a bit.
But you've got to watch them when they're, when you're in the wet.
You w if your d wheel does move it wo n't move far.
You get used to that, the wheel moving over a bit.
It will stop itself.
It will, it just might slide a bit but it will stop sliding when it comes off it.
Well you you've travelled another hundred yards.
Yeah.
Keep away from the kerbs.
That's the most important thing.
Well you can go straight up to Longridge Lane.
Up to Gr Gravelly Corner.
Are you going over to Droitwich on it or will you go in your car?
When you got ta go Droitwich?
Oh tomorrow.
Well the weather forecast is dry anyway.
Get used to carrying it.
Get used to carrying it.
I always found that awkward at the top.
Specially if there was cars on the hill and I had to pull up behind them.
Cos you you run out of you know, what things to do.
Cos you've got ta have one foot on the ground and you've got ta have one o ha foot, one on the brake.
one on the clutch, one on the throttle.
and the other one on, and your gear change.
You're one missing.
Plymouth Road's another awkward one.
The first, the first down bit when you're going down Plymouth Road.
When you come to the right, the bend.
And it gets wet down there as well.
It gets a bit slippy on there.
And there's manhole covers as you come out the bend.
Yeah.
Go at a speed you can enjoy it.
Go at a speed that you can enjoy riding it at.
And it will last you longer, you know?
Your bike, the engine, the oil.
You reduce it's life.
It should cruise along at about fifty at, you know, quarter throttle.
Yeah.
It's about right for a four hundred.
Mine would be doing about five grand at that.
Four and a half, five.
Mine went up with, you know let's face it if I was doing sixty mile an hour it would be doing just over six grand.
Anything over that, you know mine is going up towards the seven into the red.
Yeah.
And mine did and mine's only a, mine was only a sm you know one eight five.
Do n't, just keep your revs down.
Hello Rick.

And it's overflowing, that's the overflow there!
And you can see it's running down from the bottom, the pressure innit you see?

I knew there was a water leak there but if it had n't with rain that it definitely was a water leak.

A million pound a day!
Course the most sickening part of it is, that the twenty five thousand with British Telecom well they're making millions of pounds profit everyday!
It's all to do with money before jobs now.

Rough idea if you.
You toe rag!
Yeah.
Course you have.

Well they ha they ca n't do them, I've worked with the people who have got qualifications and they come and ask me wha-, what the basics!
That's right.
We've got our one of our ex-bosses, he er when he got the job is the first thing he does is paint all the walls and put all his certificates up!
He had about forty or fifty!
And one whole wall was covered with certificates!
I mean, and he had n't got a clue!
Not clue!
He's driving a bus now!
But that's what they look for they think it's clever.
Kate, yeah see her the other day.

So Kate's living next door to across the road from.
Yeah that's right.
Oh!
First one.
Cos he eats them!
Wasps are his favourite.
They're his delicacy!
When we have jam jar or anything in the garden he can not get his nose out of it!
He waits for them to on the ba, on the jar you know!
And of course he tips the jar off eventually, and we have fill it up again!
I've never known a dog eat so many wasps!
You're strange!

You're stupid!
No hoping to go over to Ireland for a week but not.

Did n't you?
I wonder why you did n't go.
I had the Granada at the time.
I'd only just bought the Granada.
It was the weekend I bought the Granada, I'm sure it was when we went away first time I ever took it out for a run.
Good old car that was I made a profit on that.
The bloke the bloke that wanted it could n't wait to get his hands on it.
No, he knackered that!
He did n't have it long he wrecked it!
They started playing about with it you know?
Playing about with the engine and playing about with the body work, trying to do it up and all this and they just they just.
wrecked it.
Well this is it you see, his son was supposed to be a mechanic, well he was n't!
He was a employed by Dorrisons I think as a recovery bloke, you know.
cos he he thought he was a mechanic because he was doing that sort of work.
Course he started messing with the er bodywork and the engine and they just wrecked it, but then he sold it to another driver and this other bloke Bob erm oh.
Bob, Bob, for a bit and he done a few miles on it and then he sold it to somebody else in the garage.
Yeah and then it disappeared then, I think, you know, I could see it deteriorating every day it was about, it was about three of my cars parking here.
Cavalier yeah.
Good car that.
Oh he had that Cavalier for a few years after I sold it.
Which one?
The Cavalier, yeah, it was, I liked that one.
I just hope the steering's lighter on this one.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hope it's lighter on this one.
You could afford a Mini though.
But you could afford to cho I mean, the cheapest Metro is only about er, six grand you know?
Not a lot.
to me.
You ne.
Yeah.
You see yo really you'd need to be you'd need to be only need to be paying back about four grand you see, though?
You'd be paying something like what I pay, which is a hundred and.
Forty five a month.

Come back without the ball!
Come on you!
No I'm not, erm if I, if I take her for a long run.
I'm gon na go in now.
She's been the lav that'll be doing for now.
All the way down.
It's gon na rain by the look of it.
Have n't seen her for a couple of month, have you?
Yeah.
Oh sorry!
Ay.
I know.
The contract is back again, I done all this erm water pipe it were all gravel in there sunk into the ground you know big hole in the ground!
We went back there yesterday.
Ah yeah.
and Andrea phones me up, she says do you wan na do one of the tours for me, take the kids round?
Yeah I do n't mind I only get the cla, the the lad, the group with the two naughty boys in do n't I?
Ah!
They were.
Yeah.
Was there a teacher with them?
Oh yeah.
Go to your mum!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh!
Was she?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I can comb my hair now and then we go straight up town.
And it looks like nobody'll be able to drive in their car, except for Aunt Mary.
She said the only way you could another way you can cut your costs, he said, is, is that due to all these drivers he said, you've got it you've virtually got any driver on this car said just just have it you and yo, and your wife he said, and that'll cut your costs down enormously.
Which?
Mm it's alright.
Yeah, it does it's alright.
It's funny you know, since I've been having these new cars I see these old cars, what a lot of bloody rubbish on the road, you know!
Yeah, bloody right!
It'd do me and all if I had to.
It'd do me and all if I had to.
Do n't bother me!
That's right, yeah.
Make do with what you ca, what you can afford at the time.
Oh, do n't say that!
Dad, if that's what you wan na do, nobody's.
But as long as you earn your living that's nice and quiet, and you wo n't have no problems in that area.
No unless you wan na move for a specific reason, there's just.
no point in moving.
No that's.
that's what you've got ta look for you see.
Now, you see you're lucky that that he's, he's sort of over there.
and the other side detached, and how many kids have they got?

Three girls, see you're lucky really cos if they'd had three boys an i, in a few times, you know, ten years time like, they'd have all, the boys would of been growing up and they'd have had cars stuck everywhere, you know what I mean?
Though with the girls, that's a bit more unlikely.
I mean, I know it s sounds stupid but that's what you've got ta look for today.
You look at your neighbours, see how many kids they got, see what age they are and work out what's it gon na be like in ten years time.
Like Billy were he lives, he lives on by the courts, you know by the Law Centre?
He gives me a lift to work.
Yeah.
And er these people, you know, next door like have got er they've got six or seven boys I think! gang of kids!
They're boys.
They said all of a sudden they've all grown up!
That's how we got terrible problems cos they've all got erm cars.
And his father's one of these obnoxious types you know?
All anybody you know?
Yo, I do n't care what you do!
You do what you like, I do what I do, you can you know?
Please yourself!
And they've got this doberman or something that barks all the time like, and it's allowed i in the garden and it sits in the garden all the time and all the rest of it!
They just do n't care!
Yeah, they're probably.
lived next to me, I'd have poisoned it?
the other day.
yeah.
Oh!
I'd have shot him and all!
Yeah, they are rubbish them there though!
Yeah, you bought the right one.
Wa I would n't mind buying one of them myself you know wi I mean if we could sell ours.
you know, we could buy one of them and have no mortgage.
I should think.
the cars.
You've got your own frigging mortgage!
I know if I popped it right now, I mean yo you'd a and Trish and Teresa, you, Debbie, Teresa and Mark.
You'd have about, I think it's about fifty five thousand.
That'd buy you a new car would n't it?
That's if I die when I'm fifty five or over.
The is about fifty five or over.
Shall I wait here?
Yeah, I've left it here for you right.

Mm.
one of wo one of the worst ones cars ever made I mean they do make rubbish, but that's one of the worst ones!
No.
Yeah.
