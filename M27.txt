I do n't like to get stuck in the place on the same open road, and I like when I go on holidays right.
I like to get out, you know.
do things out, you know, this is me, because this is what a holiday for me is, is all about get away off the regular routine of.
you know, thinking they will, oh christ you know what am I sitting down here for doing that anyhow, I could of been done that at home before I did n't have to.
That's how I look at it.
Oh I go down beach for a few hours really.
I mean which we did the last time we went we went down the, the beach and so on down the.
we had the old beach beds and we eat out over there.
and it's really nice.
Got a car then you can go everywhere.
Yeah ten, ten quid.
a fiver.
Erm Los Aldos.
It means the height.
If you're enjoying yourself, enjoying myself I mean, we like to go you know, like place like museums see the history of the place you know.
things, I mean where we went to.
we wanted to go to the erm where they make the wine and so on.
Bristol Cream Sherry, factory.
It was right there and you know and.
Yeah.

Yeah you can drive down, drive from Marbella to Gibraltar it's all along the coast beautiful seaside sceneries.
it's all these.
place are.
and, what is it, an hour and ten minutes?
Comfortable easy drive.
To, from Marbella to Gibraltar and it's places that you can stop all along the way.
Yes.
king this and king that and prince.
they come in with their big.
some of those, some of those yachts there.
make the Britannia look like they should.
Oh Christ you're talking.
yeah.
I'll tell you what Viv if you went across there and you see them luxury boats.
We went, we went up the mountains er a fabulous hotel.
that, we went up there as in actual fact we were looking for certain place when er the postcard we had was n't it, was n't the cows given us trouble and we went.
and then we started speaking to this chap and say we were looking for this place where the erm, they sell all this food and so on, what's the name of the place, he said oh he says it's finished, so he said you know where the er, we said er where's somewhere good you know to, to go and have a nice sleep, and he told us about that place up the mountain where we went, where we all went the last time.
Auck Auckland and we went there and we went into this restaurant well believe it or not, I've never seen food like that, I mean Joy asked for a leg of lamb, I did n't say leg of lamb, I had the cod pieces.

Oh Venavae that's right, yeah and the chap brought over a whole leg of lamb.
yes.
oh dear.
Yeah and we had, we had, what for starters you know.
prawn cocktail.
liqueur and li liqueur after that and I things like and how did it cost us?
It must of been about what?
It were n't a tenner each, must of been I would say about six quid each.
Four quid.
Yeah.
Most days.
you would.
they were all share drop down the sale.
and when we went back again he'd even, I know.
it's.
one night, it was like, but, even better than our.
and old.
you know.
round the sides where they've got the drunks tucked up old steel rails all around.
if, if, if, if, it'll take you, what is it that'll take us to go up there?
Before.
maybe two hours.
and know you can do it in less than an hour, right to the bottom.
to the.
Yes which is nice.
Yeah.
in a big open square.
You get the.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
on the Peonies on the Peonies.
that's right.
Yeah.
The stallions.
Absolutely, the things they get those horses to do.
Yeah.
Went in this yard this place had oh lovely gates and I walked through straight up to the house and ring the bell, and it's.
Yeah, yeah.
down here and you've got ta turn right at the.
he got his car out, beautiful Mercedes.
Yeah.
took out and showed us how.
I mean you want to see his house I mean it was set back off the road and you see the people pull ploughing.
you know round the entrances.
and then, they, how they've got their money from their own blood, not everything up there you know.
It's not the sort of place I would like to live and have.
True.
That's right.
I do n't know.
my boss you see my boss is n't very workaholic at all.
he's in there every morning before eight o'clock and he do n't leave there much before half past six, sometimes seven o'clock, and then the workers goes in on Saturdays and if he knows there's nothing to do just walk around a crowded place and.
but I mean he's a millionaire, and that's how, I mean this is the difference between probably between him and Joe, I mean he do n't depend on money to come into this.
cos there still an.
so great in running different.
and so on, every month their money is straight into the bank all their cheques come in straight into the bank so he'll, you know, and I mean our pla, and the whole of the site nearly is let out for different people, you know, which is money coming in all the time.
you see?
But I mean you know he's a workaholic and he expects everybody to be the same and then he works in there by the time I get there in the morning he works, works solidly right through until I leave there at night, you know.
Half past ten.
Yeah but, yeah but you see.
no it's a, it's, it's, it, it, it is not like that I'm making an excuse, I always think ahead and look ahead right, now I've got a phone in my cab, all the other lorries have, you know, a mobile phone, right, how he know I'm supposed to give the.
drop off at half past ten right, that's.
if I finish on road in the.
right, they jump in my cab and I decide to drive away and he phones and then he.
can you get the so and so erm.
driver for me on the phone, so he calls me up, oh we've got load of them he said.
I get back to the phone many time later you know see, I ca n't.
be late, because then I would be lying cos I'm just home and I want to get.
pick up so and so, so and so, I know, you, I think.
drop myself in the.
you know.
Whereas if I had a, a, a phone in my cab, right and he, and he phone me etcetera etcetera.
at night, ok.
it will need for him to phone the firm then because he got me direct.
Well I see.
But as I was saying to George the other day.
and, and, and.
you know, he's that sort of bloke, he's a very nice bloke and he's got a heart of gold and he's saved us no end of the money ai n't he, since I've been working for him?
This is what I said.
so I suppose one counteracts the other.
compensates for the other.
They do n't find drivers.
I have to do blooming miles and miles,.
suffer all this sort of thing, you know.
I would n't of got to work.
I would never of bloody did that time, every time she says anything is about the sleep night that we had.
I blooming late night.
Cluedo.
Me hat and me coat me jacket and me hat and me, all sorts.
We use to dig er, we use to dig er, we use to dig er, dig the old ice box over with the drinks in it, ice with the orange juice, and gin and tonic and all bloody sorts.
Sangria and we'd have it, yeah.
Alright they do n't want to go to Chesterfield then we thought they could come here, look after the house, look after the house the same as we'd look after it, and Val said this.
I made up me mind.
holiday, cos I've got four weeks holiday to come now, this year and that's not, that's not.
counting the Saturdays and Sundays and so on.
That's your heater.
That's because I.
you have not tidy though.
The old.
I say you only have to take something, cardigan.
it get's, it get's cooler at certain time of day and it heats up again.
bacon.
do n't need to buy eggs, eggs over there.
duck eggs.
And this is what, this is what we like to do you see enjoy yourselves.
We like to go out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
We bought these, we bought, we bought these up the road er, they've got a big er ceramic place there, any imaginary thing at all you wo n't.
Not, not the Rhonda I mean oh yeah, I know where you really mean, yeah.
no it's, it's up from Venice, Quan.
yeah.
and this big, yeah.
just half of that is a fiver.
Yeah, but it's still a.
you see, I, I wove the basket.
I, I and I sew this.
and.
I bought it only cost be about what, I think we said er, what less than a pound each, them two ash trays.
and er I saw them on a rack and they were.
cups, and all to go, to go with it.
That's the same.
Plenty of ice, yeah.
yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
When we go down to the market and erm, what they call it.
Bwangdirola you go round there, right.
One, the one section, one section of it, it's all women clothes and lace ware and beautiful clothes and so on, you know it's a market but you know and little places of pottery and so on and then the next section you go down this old market, there's a old big square and you walk on there and you're talking about, you go to buy avocados over here, you're buying sixty and seventy pence for one, and you're paying sixty pence for about bloody six over there.
and they're bloody great big things like that.
Yeah.
and you know mushrooms are so light.
half a kilo.
Cherries and grapes we got.
cherries, strawberries, grapes the bloody lot, seedless grapes, grapefruit.
Yes that right.
I do n't know how they arrive at all their bloody prices over.
Yeah, oranges, they're beautiful oranges.
Lovely big grapes.
beautiful oranges.
squeeze them.
fresh orange.
yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, it's fabulous.
But you see the parts of these cars now, right, like erm, what you say Nissan and blooming Toyota's and so on, right, they've got their factories open here.
if you went to Burton-On-Trent I think it's Toyota, you ought to see the size of that blooming place, er it's right huge where they're manufacturing cars, eventually, well probably now parts of these are, are, are going to be cheaper.
They're going to be cheaper for the English market but they'll have to put on their prices for the export market for those that are going out.
the company expect this.
but do n't these Japanese factories who their idea now are, are they about to tend.
Ford's are blooming, all these people are.
are gon na start suffering.
Because they're too, because they're too blooming expensive.
When is Easter?
Yeah probably he has to scratch.
He did have one today all morning.
came down, I think he came down and all of a sudden.
blop, he was back with him, he stays out there all the time when.
come down.
Have you, have you been in your garage yet with sold on, what you can sell and what you ca n't sell?
Oh well you.
half a bloody greenhouse.
you do n't wait until the last.
because I say if he's got a key and he can get in.
yeah.
oh.
Yeah he's got a key.
to be there.
so he's not allowed to take anything out.
well if I were you I would start sorting out if there's anything good in there that you can make a few bob out of.
you can sort it out.
you sort it out and.
I tell you what.
half.
and that's what he.
they'll get into the, they'll get into that garage right, so they look and see things they did n't know that they can make money on.
Tell you what if they've got a hydraulic jack in there, several people have to buy it off him, the boys will buy it off.
What, the jack?
Three ton?
There, I'll tell you what, the garage, were always looking for blooming things like that, that's what they want to.
after that you want to put all your, wan na put it in a box of, and see what you.
selling and then if there's anything that's.
then you wo n't.
I do n't know what he took, no one here, full stop, they ca n't say well he ca n't say well I left it here either and he's got any proof.
you sell them it and make yourself a.
yeah.
I've got bloody drills here and all sorts you do n't want a.
Oh that reminds me as well what your.
how you getting on better down, you know, your poll tax business, are you getting any relief on the cheaper unit?
You're not?
Is that true?
Yeah.
If, if, if, if it's, if it's, if it's, if it's two of you living in the house right the poll tax is n't paid by one person, it's each person is, is responsible for their own poll tax.
No, if one's not working and the other one's working, the one that is n't working's supposed to get relief on it.
Mm.
Yeah.
Er how could I, I mean, is there a.
I mean there's so much of money coming in the house every week.
Yes, but this is not, yeah.
this is not a.
this is er, this is er, erm, how do they call it?
I think it's imposed by, by the laws of England.
right, this whole tax business, this is not a thing when you incur the.
they've stuck on you, right so I mean alright, I'm paying, I'm paying my food.
if you work it out this year, right, Joy keeping her dole right, this one, say.
having this whole thing out, right, she'd pay right, I bring home wage, right believe it or not I'll tell you it's about between a hundred and eleven and a hundred and fourteen pounds a week, that's forty and ten, that's a hundred and fifty pounds a week, right, now if she got to pay poll tax out of that, right, what she's getting which is twenty odd pounds a month.
I've got to take twenty odd pounds a month, right.
that's forty.
Yeah.
yeah.
yeah, plus your rent.
yeah.
so this is what I'm saying how come that the she's still got the poll, we have to, got to pay poll tax at that rate because she's not working.
I do n't know how, I, I as I say I ca n't figure it out how they work it out though because I mean are they.
You would have been, you, you, you would have been better off paying your normal rates as you used to pay.
than in actual fact because they're making a.
Four hundred.
Yeah, they're better off paying the normal rates.
and they've stopped this on you and they expect you to pay all this amount of money I do n't know.
Yeah.
So, so, so much per day.
or whatever it is, yeah.
yeah.
It might be, I think in actual fact during your er, I think it might be a waste of time, but I think it's probably advisable to try and find out a bit more about this.
Yeah.
Yeah, a hundred and eleven pound a week.
I, I tell you what.
I've got more money, I've got more money than that and after I've been, after, after I've paid, after I've paid the tax.
out of that and my National Insurance contributions, that's all I come out with.
No five hundred quid.
You ought to shop him for the income tax then.
Last word will be.
I said oh well, what.
I said to him well where the receipts to prove this paying this taxi, right.
well which, or which taxi firm you've been using.
and they get.
for the taxi books as well.
because I'll tell you what when they send a probe in, they go through every blooming thing with a fine tooth comb.
er.
Yeah.
You see, I mean, what happens is erm.
If, if, if, if Jersey right where I used to have the, Joy used to have the house.
because this is once a year, there's not.
right they knew exactly how much money I was banking, how much money was going into the bank, I.
they always say, they always turn round and say well the bank is not su supp supposed to divulge how much money you've got in the bank now, now how did they have any.
ah?
I do n't know if they do the same over here.
where the bank is not suppose to disclose how much money you've got in that.
income tax man had go.
because you're suppose to declare what you earn.
for a year and pay the tax out of that.
right.
but how did they.
When they start probing you, they go right back and I mean they went back what ten, twelve years did n't they?
Yeah yes.
It's the.
seemed that the police and we've got a.
in theft and fraud and.
things like this, but regards to the fact that when, when something is sold to somebody right, erm, and then a, and, and the person who's selling it receives the money, I mean the person the police ca n't do nothing at all about it unless fraud comes into it.
Yes.
Then you've got to pay half the bills.
I think that, I think in actual fact, that the only thing really to do is if he does n't want to be himself do something else and then he wo n't do it ever again.
He should sign it all over to you and say alright I'm relinquishing all responsibility.
Yeah.
but you see.
yeah well then.
no.
And that was on the house?
Oh well.
No he ca n't.
I did n't know whether he had two loans or not or whatever it is because.
that if had relinquished all his responsibility regarding the mortgage and so on and signed it over to you, then you could have turned round and say alright that's it, I'm going to sell the house.
and if the house was, and if the house is, if say for argument sake that the house after you've sold it, you've only your, er fourteen or sixteen thousand pounds to pay then and you've paid that off, right, and the house was sold for about forty thousand.
right, you've made yourself a, your, twenty thousand anyway, then you could probably buy a, a nice little two bedroom bungalow.
for about thirty thousand or something like that and then go back to work and just pay your own mortgage off.
but a, as I say if it's, you know, if he got ta pay off all this money first well.
Good.
No.
but all the things, everything that comes now comes to Mr and Mrs, you know?
Yeah.
Which is if I'm a.
They only.
It seemed that.
what, you see, what, what happens you see, I mean all my re all the transactions here are done through banker's orders you see and the banker's orders they, they wo n't know who, who ever it is going to be responsible you know, but you've got to put down the wife and, and yourself, see.
but this is where, where it goes back to the, to the house.
as Mr and Mrs you see?
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean the boy gets, the boy gets as the boy gets older obviously the council will look into it because you ca n't have a wife sleeping in the same room.
as a boy, therefore why do n't they.
I know, I know.
bloody stupid, look at him.
Yeah but as I say it's the same as when you know we come over when we went up to the.
the place, I mean, the chap down at the housing down there, try to say to me we made ourselves homeless.
I said how can you make yourself homeless if you've been evicted?

Went past the garden, they did n't find her for thirty minutes the little girl!
But the mother.
hit the front of the car and she went that way, and she finished up in the hedge.
