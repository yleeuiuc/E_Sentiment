Okay.
If things had turned out differently I'd been driving you down here.
No it wo n't be long saying that a year ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your welcome.
Hurry up.
Yeah.
I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I'd never driven in the dark before.
Mm.
Yeah I must admit I think that a little bit erm.
Yeah.
I suppose I could have er looking at.
By the time I'd finished, yes it was pitch dark.
Yeah.
But in any event it would be a good idea if I had some tests some lessons in the dark.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I found it.
Yeah.
Yeah I'd find it quite difficult well I could see the headlights coming up and I was thinking now how fast is that car coming up I do n't really know.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well he had to switch on the interior light to be able to fill out the form.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm yeah.
Yeah.
I'm coming with you I've got to do er I've got ta do some prep.
Yeah, but you may be recorded.
Oh.
Where did he come from?
Yeah.
Yeah Oh he was n't gon na wait.
either.
Oh dear.
Yeah I think so I must admit from one point of view I'm quite glad that I have n't passed cos.
it's a bad as you said it's a bad time to start driving now there's an awful lot of.
idiots on the road especially coming.
up to Christmas.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah you're right I look at the headlights.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Well your pupils re erm.
react into the headlights, yeah so it makes it seem darker.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There was one point during my test when I was driving along and erm the I was creeping forward in a stream of traffic and the person in front of me had crossed the solid white line at some traffic lights and the lights changed and it would have been very easy to follow his lights and just carry on.
but I did n't I stopped.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No the only thing that consumed me I was looking to see if there was anyway that material from the seat could be used to sort of target us for a mailing system or something like that.
Not not if they stick by th what they've said.
Well yeah.
Yes that's right He was travelling was n't he?
Yeah.
Could do, yep.
Yeah.
No No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's whether we put the desk in the room.
Mhm and then she'll feel she's not had anything for Christmas.
Well this or.
We'll have a think through.
Yeah.
Yeah and she'll have other things to open on Christmas day wo n't she.

Yeah.
No.
Oh god.

The.
What do you think?
Tony?
Yeah, okay but we'll have to do it when we've got time.
and that might be shortly before Christmas anyway.
You might have to wait until we're act.
Oh you might have to fit you might have to fix you might have to wait until we've got time off over Christmas before we do it, anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well I'll have to do it over the weekend.
Right.
Yeah.
There's Dad.
Erm I'll stop this a minute.
It's got a little microphone out there you alright you got the bags.
Right.
Yeah, Yeah you take.
We what?
Oh yeah ah I.
have n't got the letter it's in the car.
I do n't think, I do n't think I'm quite that shape.
Erm.
Oh I do n't know Yeah.
On I had a half day on Wednesday.
took my driving test.
And I.
failed.
Otherwise I'd have been driving tonight.
Erm but er no not a lot, not a lot.
erm use of erm use of clutch of and gears was a bit needed some more work.
I er ended up I I coasted round a corner which is something you should n't do.
Erm and I sli I yo pulled me up to one corner and I know it's really nasty.
Erm so I slowed right down and then was criticized cos I over sl cos I slowed down too much.
I knew it was a really tight corner and so I slowed right down and was criticized for it, ha.
Mm.
I do n't know.
Yeah.
Ooh ooh.
Mm that's a nine feel the inside of that.
It'll be ideal for work.
Mm.
What is it what's it made of?
Is it?
Oh that's okay How much are they?
Mm.
That's not bad what are those? cheaper.
Do n't like them.
to be quite honest.
They're smart, they're a bit I do n't like those they go slippy slidey all over the place with those but these are nice.
Those?
Yeah they do.
Yeah they look they do look comfortable but.
I mean I do n't have to wear black shoes but they do suit.
Why's that?
Mm?
Mm.
Mm.
No.
That's right.
Yep I agree erm I'd better try them on had n't I?
I hate this.
Erm.
I do need a new pair of shoes.
Certainly oop er ooh.
That's a nine have they got.
a ten.
I'm not it's just that my fe ah but they're not laced up are they?
Ah now that's better only it felt as if my.
Yeah.
Yeah, they're quite soft anyway it just felt as if they were sort of my toes were sort of jammed up against the end but.
Ah I mean they will soften anyway and they are comfortable it's just that the sides are a bit rigid at the moment but then they're bound to be and they will give.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No they're not uncomfortable ah get the other shoe off oop mm just there.
they're rather narrow just there no I'm sorry they're too narrow they're really st tight across there.
I my my little toe is.
They are yeah.
No, no those are too narrow I'm getting fussy in my old age perhaps but.
Mm.
Oh no those are fine.
Those are really fine apart from the fact that it's the wrong foot ha.
Oh hang on no that's two they're it's two right foot.
Nine.
Yeah yeah those are fine those were comfortable.
Mm no they're they're fine and they they would be nice for sort of best shoes would n't they?
Mm yeah how much are they.?
Yes it does.
Seventeen ninety nine that's okay then if it's alright with you it's alright with me.
I know I'll end up with two pairs of shoes similar but.
No I'll tell you why it's not the fact that they they fit but they're too narrow if.
I went for a size ten it would be too big do you see what I mean whereas those fit okay?
Oh well it's gon na be another forty five minutes I must admit I have sympathy for the people who are going to listen to this.
Must be really boring.
Mm was quite a hard hard part of the sample to find.
The unemployed person within between thirty five and forty five.
is quite hard to find one around our estate.
A lot of the people are over employed.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah Dot was telling me how erm they had somebody with th erm similar problem but more pronounced.
and they actually failed there erm her riding test because they were n't sitting straight on the horse.
And the reason why they were n't sitting straight is because one shoulder was higher than the other.
No.
Ha ha.
If you wan na me to turn it off at anytime just say.
Mm.
Well.
yeah.
it's not my problem I'm afraid.
Yeah.
We've got enough black bags.
Okay.
She's being a vandal.

That's right what was I thinking of.
No.
Yeah.

You would have been proud of my driving test examiner.
He turned round to me and he said erm right then I'll take you t would you take me to your vehicle erm and may I call you Anthony?
So I said yes okay.
I nearly said no I do n't like it call me Tony.
oh it made it made a nice change.
No you do it when you're telling me off.

Do you mind?
You just ca n't think of anything to say now can you.
Right good.
Nobody would talk to me.
No.
It's it is a nationwide survey on spoken English erm there's a somebody approached me today and said would I carry a tape around for a week and record people talking.
Oh dear, and er I got new pair of sheets, because they were erm they were the ones I had.
So I've got that type pair of sheets.
Erm quite like these actually, there slip on's and, and they've got and they got erm studs.

I keep those best and where these then, these used to be my best shoes,.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah, thinking.

Yeah.
Did erm, have you seen this and it's for when you eh, eh change your week ending.
And what you do, is you, say the whole week ending in,, your week ending day is Tuesday, so you do that, the new week ending day, so the Wednesday's got to be four.
That's Wales, is it North Wales?
Yeah.
Yeah, how long did it take you to get up?
Not that, yeah.

Some of these official inspections are awful are n't they?
, yes.
Right.
No.
Mm, mm.
Yeah.
No, but eh, another word that was I've heard used, and it was, actually it was quite annoying because the chap used it, used it wrongly, but I did n't know that he'd used it wrongly at the time.
It was paradigm.
Yes.

You, you, you ca n't, yeah, you said you ca n't use er money as a paradigm for energy.
And what he really meant to say was, you ca n't use money as a er a as a sort of parallel to energy, but paradigm does n't mean parallel, it means something, something different.
Yeah.
No, but, he was using it as, as a fancy word for parallel and he was n't using it properly.
The trouble is I did n't know because I've never heard the word before.
Yeah.


That's right, in the year nineteen ninety one or whatever, no I thought it was quite, quite good.
Bit of erm and it's all anonymous and everything so.
What's your nickname love?
Nobby.
What do you get called Nobby for?
Oh I know, yeah.
Huh.

Huh.

I think I'll my desk.
I walking round the supermarket erm yeah last night.
and that's what and I completely the checkout girl because I, I know her quite well, we always have to guess the same one, we have a bit of a laugh and I said do you want to be erm part of a national survey on s this English er on spoken English and she said oh, alright, so I said there you are your on.
and she said what, pardon, erm, erm what have I got to say.

It's much better if you just switch it on and forget about it.
Yeah, that's, that's what I did at, at home.
The only thing is then you've got to remember if you, if you have a row or something, to go back and wipe, wipe that bit off.
Oh.

Concorde?

Yeah.
Erm, no the only stickers I've got, they've got the number written on.

And.
Alright Den?
Yes, fine thanks, oh.
Oh what is this.
What they gon na have at this fair then?
And then they have stalls and things, but you'll need money to spend there wo n't you?
You'll have to take some money with you.
Mm, mm.
Some money?
Cor I do n't know.
Have you had have you had pocket money yet?
Oh, we can let you have the pocket money.
Ah, but you might off ca n't remember whether we bought anything yesterday out of your pocket money.
Did we buy that, anything yesterday, yeah, bought some little babies did n't you?
Oh right.
Mm, mm.
Shall I shuffle along, do you want to sit on the end?
Will you have enough to do down there for that length of time Christine?
Will you have enough to do for that length of time.
No it's not raining.
I ca n't remember.
I normally bring that.
I normally bring the crate in.
Oh well not, you ca n't get them to fit?
Mm, mm.
Oh, so they do n't fit across the front.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm, but, he sorted something out for me, I, I said, cos of course now.
Yes of course, you carry on drying your hair.
erm, so what happens now, is that er I'm coming off the er, coming off the clutches as before the corner.
and if it's a tight one, and you're going round it in first, really tight one, then what you need to be doing really is slipping the clutch.
if it's really tight, slipping the clutch in first and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to control it on the accelerator, you ca n't do it.
Mm.
And it's much easier to try and control it on the clutch.
So he s, I said to him is it alright, says am I in danger of coasting if I've got my foot on the if, if I'm taking the corner in first and I'm slipping and I got the clutch, I'm using the engine but I've, not much.
and he said oh no that's not coasting.
It's only if you've got the clutch right in.
But, erm, in second my foot should be flat on the floor.
He took me round that blooming Argyle Road three times.
Yeah, cos I told that was one, I said that's, that's the one I, I over slowed on my test.
And he's told me that it's first gear, right.
So what I was doing I was coming into it, I was coming in too fast for the gear, not too fast for the corner, but too fast for the gear.
Shoving it in, shoving it into first, bring the clutch up quickly and the car goes weer and virtually stops.
so it was n't the fact I was trying to lose too much speed, it was that I changed into first and did n't have.
enough revs on the engine, he'd be going and when I lift, raised the clutch, whereas if I had brought the clutch up part way.
Yeah.
Well as I actually had to going round the corner, to get myself round the corner, I had to come off the brake and onto the accelerator.
to actually get myself round the corner.

Mm.
I took it, I, he said well try it and we went round it in first and I went and it went rrah.
and, and, so erm, we er, then I came round and I did it in second, he said there you went too wide there.
you came close to the white line.
Yes, course there's always a car parked on the corner is n't it?.

Mm.
yeah.
Mm.
I did n't have that excuse because there's a car parked before the turning.
I had to be out wide and then turn in.
and there's a car on the opposite side of the road as you turn in aha, so you go outside work and then round and ha, ha, oh.
But, that slipping the clutch is blimey useful.
I beginning to find how useful, cos I can keep the revs going.
When, when I'm not sure what's happening, and people are sort of weaving about and things like that, you can use that and you can just tick over and your ready to move if you need to and you can stop quite quickly if you need to as well.
I mean, we've, I've, there was a situation these are the roads he's taking me around now, he had me reverse round the corner which was practically blind, could n't see what was round the corner, so I was edging round, and it was on a hill so I had to do it, every time I stopped I had to put the handbrake on so I did n't roll.
And edging round the corner, checking all ways, there was a parked car, there's a van parked the opposite side of the road so anything turning in had to come over into my, the path of me.
and a, coming out of that there were some cars parked, some other cars trying to drive through, I was coming out trying to turn right, there was another car waiting to turn left, and he could n't come in cos I was coming out.
So I had to drive out past him, pull over to the other side of the road as much as possible to let him come through and the other cars come through, then I could come.
And doing that, to have the clutch sort of half way up in first you just sort of, you just.
sort of kick on and it's quite nice and you've got it all under control and if you get a chance to go you can and if you've got to stop it's no problem.
And then I got myself in a knot cos there was a car coming up the road.
between a lot of parked cars and there was a, I was coming down the road and all I needed to do was to actually stop where I was cos there was enough room on his side of the road for him to come past the parked car and round me.
I sort off, parked car there and I came up and he had room to do that.
and what I did was, there was a gap here, and I drove into the gap nose first, and I did do a hell of a lot of steering to get myself out.
Yeah.

yeah.
There's no need, no need to do that he said.
There's plenty of room, yeah there's plenty of room for him to get passed in.
Mm, mm.
Yeah.
mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
No.

Ah.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Well it's twenty five to four, what does that.
Better do this washing up had n't I?
I'd put.
I put in for the eh, my driving test again.
Okay.
Sometime in the New Year now.
Well he's put a month from the last test.
Well you wo n't have it around Christmas, after between Christmas and the New year.
It'll be erm, January time I suppose.
No but now all that your doing is polishing your drive better off.
unfortunately that can be a very painful business.
Depends.
You might find it easy.
easier.
But.
Tomorrow well, trainee to wash and a hoover.
This is yet, Tesco's open as well, we've lost our.
little driving spaces now.
Masterline's open, are open.
You can have a drive round actually, round by the Coca Cola factory there maybe somewhere.
you can go.
Yes it would.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can do it, but I've been driving for two and a half years.
and then it's.
And I can only just do it.
It's very, I mean the foot control is very, very.
It is.
But then again, you've got to feel a bit careful there because it can misconstrued totally.
if, but I mean if your obviously doing it and you more moving the clutch up and down.
then fair enough.
You know?
What did he say?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That corner is an absolute horrible.
it does, on the corner.
and that one you've got to drive it definitely than most corners.
so you, you ca n't treat that as an ordinary left handed turn,.
it is very.
You've got to be able to cope with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I, I wo n't tell you how I was taught to do it because I was taught to do it very differently.
I was taught to do it in first and use the accelerator.
You know.
Mm so, cos he said it'll help.
With your accelerator control, yeah.
yeah,.
yeah.
He said.
Mm,.
yeah.
So yeah.
do it on your accelerator.
whereas.
I, I finding the control on the accelerator difficult.
in first, erm, and I've got some fine control on the clutch and I can use that to deal with that particular corner.
Perhaps.
That's just what he's saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah..
There we are, I was hiding them with my hand.

Bye.
Where is it?
Oh yeah.
No, but it's near.
I do n't know it's not far away.
It's landed.
Yeah.
Not really, anyway I'm gon na get started, ok.
Hello.
Ok, I'll go and get them.
Ok..
I read the instruction again about this thing.
It actually says record all your conversations.
I do n't know how that all worked with work, because erm, they may not want me too.
So er, that's right, I'll check.
I'll check it out with the manager.
Yeah.

Oh right.
Mm.
Ok.
Yeah.
Mm, mm.
Right.
Yeah, ok.
You know I dug the information out again, I've had a read through of it, and it actually says, were asked just to record all your, all your conversations.
So it's not for me to sort of sit quietly and listen to, record other people, so it's my conversation they want.
No, not very often.
Where, unless somebody's fallen asleep or something has bored somebody to death.
Erm, now what am I doing?.
Yes I do, that's why I put the kettle on.
Erm, I better put these in the freezer for now had n't I?
Cos were not going to do Christine's two straight away.

She's after h, our cake.
After our cake is she?
Well, she had a chocolate biscuit, she had one of those snack things and an orange chocolate biscuit.

And that was well erm, ha about an hour ago now.
That's right, I've been exceedingly cruel to her.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, on tape You know this ah, it's the, the actual letter says we would like you to do, what we would like you to do is to record all your conversations with other people except telephone conversations over a, over a one week period, erm, but that's, that's not, does n't quite, just need to record as much as I can.
Which is fair enough, that's what I'll do.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
It does n't say anything about background noise or anything.
So, television's on, radio's on or something.
Yeah.
.I love that cat.
Mm, wow.

Mm.
Yeah.
That's right, so we'll have a look at it shall we?
Yeah, second tape.
It actually says that it, to only tell people if they ask what your doing.
Cos if people know there being recorded they tend to.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah.
Mm, mm.
That's what I, that's what I said, yeah and they say that if your just walking around, unless your actually on your own.
Mm, pardon me, it's just, it, it pays just to run it, just to keep it going continuously.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, Big is on.
Big.
Yeah on Wednesday Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins, a twelve year.
Yeah.
A twelve year old makes a wish at a fair ground fortune telling booth that he could be big, and the next morning his astonished to find that he's fully grown.

If I get Jack and somebody on the bus I might pop my hand inside my brief case and press the recorder where's that cameraman hid then? oh it's built into the dashboard, yeah.
She's trying to be very nice and she's really fuming Have you er finished with your tea?
I get you another.
Yeah, look forward to that.
I'm not erm, I'm not going to be in a situation to record all my chat anyway, I do n't think, because of the erm, the amount of it, when I'm running a course I do an awful lot of chatting during the day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And also I do n't, I do n't want it to be a barrier either.
You do, yeah.

Your tea's ready.
Oh.
Mm.
Yeah.
Christine your tea.
There you are.
Oh there pretty kilts on there.
I was just thinking I wonder how my erm, what a do about choir practice this week.

I'm not recording ca choir practice.
That's not conversations is it?
I suppose I a better mention it too Pauline, only I was thinking if I did just conversations, could also do the domestics.
And then not record anything to do with the procedures, although there are some things that will probably be ok to record.
Yeah.
Question, of whether I ask Pauline, or I whether I just do it.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean there are certain things like, the general conditioners to benefit, which erm, are alright, but there are other things that I know about and that I will pass on to people to look out for that I would n't want eh, that you would n't want eh, erm, outsiders to know.
Oh, right.
Mm.
Yeah.
yeah.
Do you want a roll?
Ok.
Alright.
, yeah.
Oh, oh yes, cos she, was n't she.
India.
That's right.
Mm.
Mm, mm.
Yeah.
Mm, mm.
Yeah.

yeah.
Mm.
No, good ones move on so fast do n't they?
That's why we tend to stay where we are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Can I have the salt please Christine?
Oh.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
That look's quite simple, aha, that's not.
Oh, Brian took me round that corner, right, slowed down too much.
he took me round that corner for three times today.
Ev, and, he'd say oh turn left here and all that and then you'll be going along and I'd think oh.
I'm coming up to it again, he says turn left up ahead, I think, and here we go.

Mm.
Oh.
I bet there was loads of people down there.
Mm.
He must dread that.
Twelve people.
I did n't think they took that many.
Aha, ha.
Yeah what, what's he doing?
Oh ha.
Chasing dots alike.
I think this recorder must be, it adjust the level automatically.
Mm.
If I cough or something it goes quite for a little while then comes back again.
Erm, there's Jaws on Christine.
Jaws the Revenge.
Yeah.
Oh this is going to be interesting.
I nearly got involved in that at one time, I's about.
yeah, I's about ten like that, when I was about eleven.
There's a metallist girl who was interested in it, she wanted me to be her partner mm, went along once or twice but.
two left feet.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
That's an audition then.
That's a.
Mm, mm.
Mm.
Mm, mm.
Mm.
Well, she's a dancer, singer all sorts acting.
Raise me foreheads be careful there.
Mm.
I must admit I was never very good at dancing but, I was good at catching.
Never dropped anyone.
Step on there feet, yeah.

Mm.
No.
Cos you've eat it all.
You've been cruel.
Aha, cup of tea?
Ok.
What the jugs?
Did n't see them properly.
Oh.
Yeah I know.
In ceramic?
A what?
Pocket T V.
Good grief she's got a good memory.
She got an awful lot of things did n't she?
There's a really good game we did at, at Rammore for remembering people's names.
And they, it was a bit frightening because we were in a group of seventeen and see what I mean when, I mean how it starts is like if were starting with me, I have to say I'm Tony, right, and then you would say I'm Jackie and this is Tony and then Christine would say I'm Christine this is Jackie, this is Tony, I was at the end of a group of seventeen and I had heard it sort of, you hear it, it builds up round the room.
So that you can in the end, when I came to do it, although it was seventeen people I did n't find it too difficult.
That's right, well no, these were people and, some of the people I knew, some of the people I had n't met before.
And so I had to sort of go round the room and say I'm Tony and this is, and go all round, and I got round the room.
Yeah.
But I was surprised that I got round the room, cos I'm awful at remembering names I think I'm gon na have to try and.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
Erm, but, we had a, that was, that was quite good, but I must, there's a trick to remembering names, and that is that you use it all the time, so any time, if you want to remember somebodys name, every time you see them you say hello and there name.
and that sort of imprints it on you.
Cos I've noticed there is an awful lot of people do that to me.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that, that can be difficult in training because you see so many people and they spend the week looking at you and they've got one name to remember, but you've got eight or twelve names to remember.
and you see them a three weeks later and they say hello Tony and you think hello, who the hell are you?.
Breaking up.
What the strap?
, oh, the case.
Oh oh I see.
Yeah, I can.
Missing a little bit missing bit further along as well.
Erm, I think if they killed a shark.
Yeah, but there's an awful lot of sharks about.
Well it was killed in Jaws.
Cos this is the fourth film.
That's right.
Yeah.
No, I ca n't, it'll, if you do n't take the head of it I ca n't eat it, I could n't even, I have prawn cocktail and you have a prawn, they put, they put a prawn on top whole, I could n't eat that, I could have peeled it, I looked at it and I thought about it, no, I can eat them when there done.
but not when there not done.
Sorry.
Yeah.
That's right.
Mm.
That's right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Is that a mechanical one?

Yeah.
Mm.
What?
Mm.
You sneezing Rene?
Sneezing?
I've been doing that today as well.
Good if I get a cold cos I got erm training course next week.
Five days of non-stop talking.
Mm.
I tried to, er, I told I got criticised for slowing down too much, going into a corner on my dr driving test, I told Brown which corner it was, he took me round there three or four times to s today on my lesson, yeah, we'll keep doing it till you get it right.
That's right.
Oh pardon me.
Stop what?
Mm.
Yeah.
That big.
Yeah.
If I lo, if I sit out there looks, looking sorry for myself then somebody will take me.
Oh is he related then to er.
That chap with the curly hair.
Oh right.
Right.
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah, got it, ok.
Th this shark has got nine lives I think.
Erm,, no I do n't think he's a toy-boy.
Mm.
Really.
, oh great.
Oh.
When were watching television and nobody's talking much there's not much point is that?
No, unless somebody comes with me.
Yeah, you've got to do it with the right inflect as well.
There's a good boy.
There's a slightly response too.
Yeah.
Are they?
Oh.
Well.
Yes.
That's just what I was gon na say.
Mm.
Mm.
. I do n't know half the people in area office to send them cards.
They say in that thing that you do n't want half conversations.
Yeah, if you think you might come to the end of a conversation before you reach the end of the tape, they've rather you put a new tape in.
I suppose.
sorry, put it in the erm put it in the cage, first thing I built.
Put in he's bedding.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah.
Never mind, see what the weather's like tomorrow then wo n't we?
No.

If there's only a bit of beef you have the beef and I'll have some cheese.
Yeah and some for Christine.
Ok I'm happy with that.
Yeah.
No, it's alright, I'll have the cheese.
Yep.
Yeah.
Aha.

I, she's been ripping all the newspaper.
Great.

Yeah, it'll be nice and you can fix, fix them up a run and.
Do you want me to do crisps or anything?


It'll be more extravagant to let it go to waste.
No, I never do it.
Yeah.
Neither do I.
I said neither do I.
Yeah.
Cupboards fine it's eh, in fact there's too much stuff in it.
I to get down in the cupboard.
Oh.
I do n't know what you've done.
I hope not I see if they want any do you want, do, do you want any crisps?
Mm, mm.
Ok.
Got any chipsticks?
That's right, yes.
That's alright.
Chipsticks and a pickled walnut, yuk.
Aha.
Yeah, cost a fortune.
Yeah, cost a fortune.
That's right, yeah.
With about a third of a cup of milk, you mix it up with some sugar and then you put boiling water in.
One, one full teaspoon.
, find a space for it again there.
Oh, yeah.
Do you want some crisps?
See you, yeah.
Yeah.
See you again.
Yeah, cheerio i n't Christine ought to go to bed?
Yeah.
Christine.
Just at the moment yeah.
Oh, that's nice.
No do you want me sort out the gerbils.
Ok.
Yeah.
Mm, mm.
Is it?
I'll get them some fresh water as well.
I'll get, give them some fresh water as well.
Yeah.
I.
Mm.
I pulled up fairly tight behind a car.
and then I was trying to come out and I started to pull out into a gap and Brian said oh know, do n't pull out I said oh okay, he said the thing is your fairly tight so your gon na have to come out slowly so you need a bigger gap than otherwise.
And the gap was n't really big enough, do you know what I mean?
It would off been o okay if I just been able to pull out and drive down the road.
because I had to pull out round the stationery vehicle as well, I would off taken too long getting out.
and I'd have caused the other one to slow down.

Yeah.
I've pulled the old greens out.
They did n't seemed to have that much of it actually.
Yeah Oh.
Yeah.
A couple of tins of peas left out, try and find a space for them to go back in again.
Not easier.
Yep, ok.

Shall I put this in there?
Oh, there's a good girl.
Mm, she's got a lovely coat.
Ah cos of the food and the condition she's kept in is n't it?
Oh god,, I've checked, all this has got to be chucked away, has it?.
Ok.
Yeah.
Oh there.
What, what is it Christine?
Ok.
Alright.
Yeah, ok.
Christine's gone to bed.
You alright?
Shall I er lock the front door and sort Ben out?
Would you wan na, would you wan na sit for a bit before he goes back?
Five to one.
Mm, could do.
Yeah.
Ok.
It's tape number four.
That one's alright, this one.
Yeah.
Oh well.
Ah.
I wonder, I wonder what they get from some people you know.
Sorry.
Yeah.

That's right.
I do find I'm conscious of it a lot of the time.
Other people probably can forget about it cos I'm wearing it, I feel conscious of it a lot of the time.
Yeah.
What I'll do when I'm, if all the if signs and buts are covered, I will put the mike on it's stand when I'm working tomorrow, put it on the desk and put the recorder in the, in my briefcase underneath the little desk.
cos there's a little coffee table sort of thing that I put my script on.
and put my brief case underneath it.
and the microphone on to on top.
Yeah, but that's, just one, I mean I'm not gon na record, if I try and record the whole of the course.
I ca n't.
That's right, but.
mm.
yeah, I ca n't do that.
No, oh, a lot of the session's when they're talking about data types and things like that oh I do n't know, cos there's security aspects to that you see.
The only way it would matter is that somebody breathes the information to, if they could get hold of a card, and get into an office, they could actually use the information to make a payment.
If they knew how.
Not unless.
No.
Yeah, I'd, I'll have to blank it out the part when I'm talking about passwords and things as well.
Cos they're all passwords that protect the system.
Yeah, but apart from that, you're right.
Mm yeah and then everyone's got their own, I've got my own personal one as well.
Mm no, mines more boring than that.
My pin number.
I use my bank pin number, that way I do n't forget it.

Mm.
Yeah, mm.
Do you know what it is now?
That's alright then.
Cos I know yours, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
nervous now, you're gon na be checking that quite a bit.


Mm.
No.
There's probably some disruption to the to the transmission or something for an.
Cos it only needs.
it only needs for a little bit of attention on a wire or something.
to just make it erm, shut out just for a split second.
and it'll throw the whole thing.
no.
Yeah.
Mm, oh I, I'd turned round, I ca n't remember what it was oh, what was it all about?
I was doing a training session and I said erm I'd, I'd started to say something and I'd done it, I was talking about something and I had n't done the bit before.
so they could n't understand what I was saying, do you know what I mean?
and I said erm,.
forget all about that, just let your mind go blank and I look round and I said cor that was quick.
Cos they're all looking pretty blank anyway you know.
Well I do n't think information about the, the seven, what are the seven conditions of receipt of benefit and things like this would be a State secret.
Big, hairy and stroppy, you'll get whatever you like.

Not quite true, but.
Erm.
Mm.
Yeah.
But then, to my mind, the person that who, who threatens to punch the lights out and gets whatever they want, everyone should get the degree of service.
No, but it's up to the every individual to try and make sure that they do get that level of service.
Yeah well you, you should n't have to threaten somebody to get good service.
You should n't.
Depends on the people.
Depends on the actual person you see and what their attitude is.
And I must admit once I'd been I'd, early on when I did n't know an awful lot, then, yeah, but, later on when I had been more experienced there was n't, there was very little difference between how I treated people whether they made a fuss or not.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, yeah, I'm.
trying to do something about it.

Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
They're not in a situation where they can take an individual line at that point.
It's only later on when they're more experienced that they can actually say, well hang on a minute I can do more for this person and I'm going to do more for this person.
And that, and that would make you good.
I do n't know.
Mm, yeah.
The sort of things I'm talking about, I'm, I'm thinking of is ok somebody, a mistake's been made, somebody has n't got their payment out.
alright, and the difference between that is er and then the degree of service that they get, erm you can say you'll get it in the post two days in, in two days, or you can say erm, we'll get a giro cheque written out for you, initial it to you at the counter.
at half past three or you can say if you'd like to, if you'd like to wait for half an hour, we'll get a giro cheque to, issued to you or if you'd rather you can come back at half past three and collect it.
Yeah, yeah and that's degrees of service.
I mean that, in that situation I would try and say sort of.
Do you need the money urgently?
Yeah, yeah, only erm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Only thing is dealing with the awkward people.
that distinguishes a professional to somebody who is n't.
Mm.
Mm, mm.
Mm.
Mm.
They do n't,.
yeah well they do n't.
you do n't have problems with their payments.
Yeah.
Mm, mm, yeah, I must admit I would n't, I agree with what you say, where I would n't classify those people as being of no fixed abode, they're not necessarily of no fixed abode, there are a lot of people who would, living in flats and Council houses and things like that, they've got that attitude.
and some of the people who were no fixed abode, actually trying very hard to get work.
Mm.
No, but, even, even some of those erm the only thing is they tend to get work and they tend not to tell you they've done it.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
It is, it is a bit more complicated than that,.
in that er, some people would like to work, but the level, the amount of money they need coming in, is not in line with the amount they can realistically expect to earn, and that's a difficult situation.
Mm, erm, yeah, you ca n't adjust your life style by killing a couple of kids,.
that's the only problem, if you've got a large family and you've had a well paid job and then you loose it.
erm, and you're not likely to be able to get into that line of work again.
it, it can be quite difficult,.
but there are, what there was n't before, that there is now is these, erm.
well no, because what you can do know is you can go to somebody who will sit down with a mini computer and that's what you need, a mini computer and will sit down and will look at a job and will say right, if you take this job, it can also claim Family Credit of so much, and, and they actually do a, a sort of alternative benefit calculation, and what they do is they look at, if you take this job and take all the other things into account, will you be better off?
And they'll actually sit down and work that out for people and encourage them to go for a job and give them all the forms they need to claim Family Credit or whatever.
But sometimes people fall through the cracks.
and if, you can actually have somebody go, who's interested in going for a job, and when you do that sort of calculation they end up they're gon na be worse off.
And that should n't be allowed to happen, but it does.
Because it does n't su, it does n't match the whole, there, there are holes in it.
Right, erm.
Well, erm, as I understand it er calculations for in work benefit at erm, by somebody who's separate from the normal benefit section.
and I do n't think they, they will pass on information about somebody actually refusing to take a job.
because of the pay.
But, the system ought to be water tight, so that people are better off.
but the trouble is it's so complicated there are always exceptions and problems that cause.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,.
Mm, mm.
No.
Well.
yeah.
What you've got to take into account is that, an all, there's an awful lot of things that you get when your unemployed that stop when you find a job.
Interest on mortgage, yeah.
mm.
Also if you're in rented accommodation you're claiming housing benefit, you'll probably have n't got to pay any rent, specially if it's Council there's relief, relief from paying.
community charge, which you do n't get any more once you start working.
Well.
it depend, it depending on your circumstances, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Erm.
I believe, ah, I believe the D S S do look at the situation, but they, before, yeah,.
before they actually suggest to somebody that they sell a house, that they sell a house and moved to a smaller one, they have to be unemployed for quite some time.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Aha.
Mm.
Yeah.
D S S do n't help with the mortgage, at the first I think it's ten weeks as well, but I think help with the mortgage at all.
Unless people are insured for that sort of period in time any way.
I do n't think we are.
Yeah.
Oh, I do n't know if we would be.
Mm.
It's very, very complicated.
There's no way it should be that complicated a lot of the problems are caused by the rules being so complicated that you have to be working in that particular field.
with two or three years before you really know what's going on.
and in Avon we've got erm we've got a large turn over of staff.
people do n't stay out long, so you do n't get many people getting up to two or three years experience, the one's that stay on that long stay.
They're, and they're very good and they, they tend to stay a long time.
But then they tend to get promoted and move on to other things.
Yeah, mm.
Mm.
Yeah,.
mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm I would n't there are ten per cent, well perhaps less than ten per cent who are absolute loonies.
Erm, but an awful lot of people who would go up and make a fuss may not get this, the same level of services erm, somebody who went up there and was nice.
They might get less.
Well.
The thing is you have to look at your source of information for that.
They might think they're getting away with it, a lot of people who, who, I mean being unemployed is n't, you tend, people tend to feel devalued and so if they can think oh, they've put one over on that, on the er, benefit office, then they'll go and brag down the pub about it.
Whereas in actual fact if they come in very nicely and ask very nicely, they might have got more than they actually got here when they came in shouting and yelling.
, but then, when you come to the lunatic fringe then supervisor's will cut an awful lot of corners to prevent them busting up the office or punching somebody in the nose, a real, I do n't mean people who are just stroppy, I mean the real lunatic.

Yeah, I mean there are some virile people who are mentally sub normal.
There are people who are mentally ill, for one reason or another, there are people on drugs, there are people who are alcoholics and when those people come in, in that state, you minimize the areas of confrontation.
Well there's only one thing you can do any way.
Mm.
Mm.
Income Support, yeah, but Income Support, paid indefinitely.
And Income Support is a lot more than Unemployment Benefit anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, Unemployment Benefit is only forty one quid a week.
Or sixty five if you're claiming for a wife,, what good is that?
Ah, yeah.
I do n't think you've got that right somehow, there's no way, that retirement pension will be less than Income Benefit, it's always a bit more.
that's based on National Insurance Contributions.
And dad's in receipt of a, in receipt of a full pension.
Right, he's getting more than sixty, sixty five quid a week.
Ok, it might not be a lot more, it might be seventy.
But it's always a bit more.
Because they.
because people who are signing on will er, well, pe he's, he could still claim Income Support.
He's got too much money coming in then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It is the same.
Mm.
Mm.
They get help with the rent?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm, it's a thought, they seemed to be able to manage ok.
I mean, were, were be in a totally different situation.
Yeah, but, we will be totally different situation.
Cos we'll end up with no mortgage, we'll get I do n't, I do n't know, if I, I must admit I rather fancy the erm, the old er the erm, a re-employed pensioner, I do n't know.
It's quite a good one.
Well I can work till I'm sixty two as an E .O.
Or Sixty as an H .E .O.
What, you could then do which I think would probably help, cos you see you do n't get State Retirement Pension till you're sixty five.
but what I, what would be a possibility at sixty two, when I'm at that point, I'd be receiving half pay.
as a pension, so if I'd retired at that point, and then worked part time.
to keep your green matter in the wear.
As an A O somewhere.
So I'll reach State Retirement Age we can, end up with virtually full pay.
When I've, I've got.
I'd be working part time for full pay, if you see what I mean.
and then at retirement age I would continue to receive half pay plus retirement pen State Retirement Pension.
which be, at the equivalent of about seventy quid a week as well.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, mm.
Mm, yeah.
Mm.
No.
Mm.
No,.
mm.
Mm.
Yeah, cos standing about waiting for buses is not fun.
Mm.
Mm.
No, I think the thing is, is once you, this is gon na sound awful, but once you've done your time and you know as much or more, then you're E O then you're gon na be left alone to get on with your job.
Yeah,.
what I mean is, that you're not gon na have, erm you're not gon na have interference like you had lately, ya, not gon na have comments like you had lately.
And, and you feel, comfortable with what you're doing, you wo n't have to erm, you wo n't have to worry about the work, if you know what I mean, you'll know how to do it.
Once you've got that, I, I think you might well fined that it's quite nice and comfortable to stay there.
Rather than, rather than face moving into Benefit where it is very fraught at times and in a situa, and coping with that as well as not knowing what you doing is n't nice.
right, you are very busy.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've never talked about that before.
Mm.
And that's, that's on a par with the sort of problem we get in benefit.
and somebody comes in, Aunt Maud has just died, what do I do?
You think, oh, and it.
Ok, erm.
No.
My kid,.
yeah, yeah.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,.
another scenario that comes up quite often is that, somebody comes in and say my kids have n't had any food all over the weekend because you did n't send out a giro.
that be a.
, well you,.
you wo n't sometimes.
Yeah, but.
Yeah.
I went down the pub on Saturday and drank it, all the rest of my benefit.
But, that's, that's what you're faced with sometimes.
But, yeah, I mean.
no, I did n't, I did n't want to say that.
I did n't want to say that because I did n't, I do n't think it is a cosy little job.
especially with the management's support you get.
That's what I meant.
, yeah, that's what I meant.
Mm.
Mm.
Ok.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah.
No, I,.
no.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, the one thing you have got there is that people are prepared to take him on.
Mm, whereas, if you.
yeah, whereas if you had the situation where people were n't prepared to take him on, it could be awful.
you have people leaving hand over fist.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Does they tend to have more gumption, they tend to have to stand up to him in the end.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

,.
so what.

Yeah.
Mm.
No.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, he then starts trying to take it back.
No.
He did n't exactly offer you the moon anyway.
But he was prepared to negotiate on something which now he's saying he did n't negotiate.
Mm.
First place, yeah.
Mm, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Well that's not time, so it does n't matter.
This,.
it's, it's a question it's not a question of cover, and it's not a question of erm efficiency it's a question of small mindedness.
Mm.
Ah, right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
She is i n't she?
Got my house keys?

They'll service it, and it'll.

The things is I got list everybody in the order in which they spoke.
Would you like to try that one.
It's all right.
Do you know you're part of a national survey.
On the spoken word.
Because it's something I'm doing and I've just recorded all our conversation here.
I've got little microphone up here.
What I've recorded and just letting them have the tapes.
And just keep a record of the time that I recorded it and er a little bit I've just got to give the first names of the people that were talking but it's done anonymously so there's no no problem with that.
No no no I did n't.
That was nasty.
Bye.
See you.
Bye.
Cheerio.
Hm hm.
It was.
So you did.
The only thing is I think I'd rather try and er find out now we know it's Fancy Goods and look it up in Thompson's local and then find out the address and then we'll find our own way down there.
No we'd just picked up Christine from her friend's house and I had sort of half a dozen people.
to on there to note down.
Somebody I'd never seen before said hello and.
Yeah.
Aye.
Yeah.
Oh I wanted I wanted not being mean I wanted to get Lorna because she's a classic example of the Bristolian accent.
And I even noticed that she she was coming out with the thees and thous that that erm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The note says sort of do n't tell people until after or unless they ask you.
they ask you directly what they're doing and erm.
as you're being my mum you did n't keep us very long.
It was er and when she got worked up about that Fancy Goods place.
It's it's really coming out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well they do n't they keep there prices down because they did n't spend a lot on advertising.

Hm.
No thanks Dad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've.
Yeah.
And erm with a dog that moves that quickly he's not just a chaser he's a catcher as well.
I notice that with Ben.
He saw something erm he saw a cat and he zoomed out the front door and he was gone and it's only when he lost sight of the cat he thought about where he was.
He just went straight for him and you know he just did n't think about where he was going or anything and he.
He was completely lost.
And as it was I could see him and I called him and he looked over and he saw me and he came dashing across all the gardens.
He was ever so pleased to see me.
But he see a cat and choo he's gone.
And he gets longer and longer.
You wonder how much longer he's gon na.
No.
He's pretty much all brown is n't he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He certainly seems to know his way around now does n't he?
Especially us.
It's the first time he's been brought out this way as far as we know.
And er he was n't walked up.
Mm and the ears are very similar.
Yeah.
But Ben's flop down sometimes uh huh.
Most of the time they flop down.
Yeah.
I think there might be a whippet Jack Russel cross.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Do you know did it say how much it is?
Hm yeah.
We can think about it after Christmas.
We ca n't do it now.
Or next year.
Yeah.
Is it?
Oh oh that's in good time.
FebruaryMarch we've had time to get over Christmas.
And the massive amount of money we're going to spend on my birthday present.
Yeah.
Why you're going to take me out to er Easy Runner are n't you?
Specialist running shop up in Saint Michaels Hill.
Yeah.
There are lots of shops about it's er sports shoes.
There a lots lots of shops about that spell sell sports shoes.
And they got shoes for squash and shoes for.
And shoes for tennis and shoes for this and shoes for that.
But this.
yeah and they sell running shoes as well.
But this one is a running specialist.
They do nothing but sell equipment for runners.
And the people who run the shop are runners themselves and you can sort of go to them and ask their advice on all sorts of things.
Yeah.
Yeah all sort of things like that.
Erm and not just shoes.
You might go up there and er I dunno you what's what's a good way of getting myself seen when I'm going out running at night and things like that you know and they'll give you advice and they'll say well there's this you can use or that.
Or you know about all sorts of running problems.
Mm?
Yeah I've done that.
Hm?
No I've got to put first name.
Occupation.
Male or female.
Well I reckon Aunty Iris was the first one cause she said oh hello.
how are you?
And then Lorna started.
And then.
Yeah.
And then you said something.
And I already had Jackie because Jackie had been speaking earlier on the tapes.
So I put Aunty Iris and then Lorna then you.
I tend to put sweat shirts and jumpers together.
Yeah.
Well the proper place is in the cupboard.
It does n't matter where but as long as it's in the cupboard.
If I want a T-shirt I do n't go to any pile I go to the hangers.
Because I hang my T-shirts up.
I hang my shirts and my T-shirts up.
and my sweat shirts and jumpers I I fold up and they're all in together.
Ah ha.
So greeny is n't it?
Oh I loved that bit in Shogun I do n't know if you remember it.
Or whether you saw it at all.
But they had er Richard Chamberlain shot pheasant.
And he hung it up outside his house.
To let it get let it rot.
Let it get gamey and he's erm Chinese assistant the person who has been assigned to sort of look after him and do his do his translating and things like that took it down and buried it cause they did n't eat rotten meat they did.
Oh you ca n't beat a wet shave.
You ca n't beat a wet shave I find I find I mean people have said that oh having a wet shave makes my face sore and things like that.
I find that using an electric shaver makes your face sore cause you're rubbing your face all the time.
Whereas.
That's right.
and it's all I mean I use this gel stuff.
which does n't dry the skin dry the skin out or anything and erm it's just like washing your face with water.
I mean it does n't I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you'd be you'd try and you'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off.
And so you'd be putting lots and lots of grease and much on your skin and then you get spots.
And you'd be trying to shave and you do n't want to cut spots.
Oh!
Horrible!
Well it's just it's not the the grease the make up or the cream it's the fact that you're you're putting so much muck on your skin all the time and it clogs up pores and causes spots.
Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off and you do that especially if you're doing two performances a day it's an awful lot mess and much you're putting on your face and you ca n't get it all off.
Hm.
Hm.
Is it nice?
Hm.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's a flat pack Yeah.
Well it er it will be wood but whether it's covered over whether it's wood grain or whether it's white or I do n't know.
Hm.
Hm.
We're gon na have to hurry up now.
I mean she she might want to buy a nice desk.
No she's got a desk tidy.
Yeah.
No no I know.
Yeah I know.
That's right.
he just folds up.
See what we can get.
There are two problems with that.
There are things certain things I'm committed to and to have time off means I still got to be able to do those things.
Do you see what I mean?
So I've got to watch that.
But I could manage.
I could certainly manage to have a half day.
And if we we're looking around in town.
Okay but.
you'd have to you'd have to come and get me and we'd go straight off.
The other thing erm is that I have n't got any leave.
Yeah.
I have n't got any leave.
What I've got enough leave to take the time off over Christmas.
That's all agreed.
But I have n't got any extra.
And I already took a half day off flexi leave.
I've already took a half day off flexy leave to have my driving test last week.
Hm.
Erm and I really want to I will build up some more time but I have n't got any to take at the moment.
Now I do n't get any more leave till February now.
I've got some leave.
But what I've got booked is that I finish when's Christmas?
Is it a Wednesday?
I finish the Friday before that Wednesday.
And I do n't go back until the Thursday after New Year's day.
And we've both got that lecture time off and so but that's used up all my leave.
I have n't got any more to take until after February.
Yes.
Yeah.
The only other thing is to er it's no good.
We've got to do things in the morning.
But but if you if you wanted to er come and meet me from work we could go straight off somewhere then.
Yeah but it's open till eight o'clock.
Yeah.
You know a lot of places that will be open late.
All the shops in town are open late on one night a week.
But I ca n't remember what night it is.
I believe in in town.
Hm. mm.
I've got a feeling.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean.
Mm.
Hm.
We did have this problem before but we started earlier did n't we?
Last Christmas?
Oh no I we had some time off did n't we?
I have n't get any time off I can take now.
I could possibly have a half day next Monday.
Because this week I'm I'm doing a five day course I tend to add on about an hour to my time every day.
Cause I tend to do half past eight till half past five with no lunch.
If I do that that's five hours I'll have built up in one week.
So I could take out half a day.
then.
Yeah zoom!
There'll be Fred waddling along.
Hello.
Oh dear.
Glad I came.
I thought they'd hidden me away in a cupboard.
Okay.
It's alright.
Not too bad.
But erm the only thing is the er you did the put together a document, file.
So.
Yeah.
And let let them have one I had something.
Erm can I apologize in ad, in advance Tony, but on Wednesday morning.
Yes?
we shall need to interrupt just very briefly to move a couple of things out.
Yeah.
That's okay.
Alright?
Erm I'm asking for it to be done first so hopefully.
Mhm.
it'll be while you're settling down rather when it's your er.
Good.
We, we're starting at nine.
Yeah.
so you know.
Well I'm hoping they'll come at half past eight.
In which case we'll be finished before you get there.
Just in case.
I think it's only three items to be moved out for you.
Not stuff to be moved in.
Good.
I got eight.
Yeah.
It's something I'm doing at the moment.
Yeah.
So if, if you wan na be wiped off I can do that.
But if you've no objections?
That's alright.
It's all in this thing here.
It's just that er I'm telling everybody.
Ah somebody approached me.
Came to my house and.
when we they found out what sort of job I did.
their eyes lit up.
Cos they were trying to fill their quota.
and they could n't find anybody living round by me that were employed.
So Certainly not in my age group.
So er.
So I get the little gift voucher.
It just means sort of walking around recording.
It's no problem.
And they give me all the equipment I need.
So er.
I, I thought that everybody would I have n't done it on erm I was wondering about recording a training session.
But then first day I was with them.
It's the first day I've been with them and I thought I do n't know.
See how it goes.
I might might check them out to see if they would mind if we did something later on in the week.
They've got to do it till Friday.
anyway.
So going to be talking to wo n't you?. actually it does n't matter because it's.
It's quite interesting.
Better show Margaret as well.
Margaret.
Can I just show you that.
Okay?
Yeah.
Where's this come from?
Well it's erm something I'm involved in.
And er something I switched the erm recorder on just before you walked in to see if it recorded.
What for the whole of the morning?
No no, no.
Just just when I was here.
Just a minute ago.
But er if you've any objections I'll wipe it off but.
All I can say is that people who hear my voice keep saying do n't you sound like Pam Ayres.
Who comes from a totally place to me.
Yes, one or two.
Yeah.
Erm Oh I was just trying to remember what, what was said.
Something to do with Ah Jerry said something quite good about availability.
Erm like you ca n't although peop people will go for jobs, now produce proof of jobs they've applied for.
You ca n't tell whether they really want the jobs or not.
And and it is.
Yeah.
No.
It shows that they've applied for the job.
It does n't show that they wanted it.
Yeah.
They really tried.
Yeah.
There's no way you can know that unless you've got the from the Job Centre that these.
And gives feedback on how they turned up and.
Yeah.
and all this sort of thing.
Yeah.
But er.
That's what really makes.
something, something very odd came out of that, this Ann said something I thought what?

And and the thing is I did n't understand it.
So it's quite difficult to remember exactly what she said.
Mm.
Erm something to do with no.
I ca n't think.
Trouble is when you do n't understand it it does n't sink in.
No that's right.
But everybody sort of.
I remembered.
Have you?
Yeah.
It's a bit like a single office group.
sitting in and we're trying to split them up cos we do n't want too.
Yeah.
Which, which they did.
But they've gone back now to sitting altogether.
So.
What's a data type for changing date of birth?
Thanks.
I could n't, I was asked and I just could n't think of it.
Yeah.
And there were no guide fives.
No.
Otherwise I'd have said look it up.
Yeah.
And I did n't have any Treas keys so I could n't tell them to use the help service.
All my options were gone.
Oh, Judy.
asked after you.
How, how you were getting on.
So I said you were getting on okay.
Yeah.?
Evidently she was sta, she was a trainer at one point was she?
Yeah.
Martin.
Yeah.
That's great.
It's my birthday on the thirteenth.
Yeah.
Erm always been lucky, especially when it falls on a Friday.
Really lucky.
Ah.
Not, not this month, no.
February.
Whenever it falls on a Friday it's always a very good birthday.
Erm I've put these codes in my box.
Being nice.
And sort of not wanting them to go astray.
I've now got them on my desk and I do n't know where to put them.
Could you politely suggest.
Oh right.
Huh.
I've lost my bearings now.
I do n't know where anything is.
Well I.
I want the cabinet with all the supplies for the trainees.
For erm tea, coffee and stuff.
Yeah.
I know it was was it on the bottom of the A to Z thing?
I would n't know.
The A to Z file's in there.
There's a big Tony.
A to Z files in?
The A to Z files are over there.
Right.
I think that's where it is.
And.
Yeah there's only two lots of cabinets.
One lot over there and one lot there.
Paid the phone bill and the Access.
Okay.
And I'll go and see the building.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
That's right.
Ah.
Mad, innit?
Mhm.
Yeah.
. Make us some tea okay?
No the course went alright today.
Mm.
No.
One or two a bit odd.
But they're alright.
Erm there's one girl who's a bit erm.
Er She's very very sure of herself.
But she's wrong.
Oh yeah.
say.
I, I feel more confident, yeah.
I just sort of say no, er.
Yeah.
Or a bad thing as the case may be.
Mhm.
I've got a oh I've got a carol practice tomorrow.
So I'm not gon na be able to get to the building society until Wednesday.
Yeah okay.
So long as you feel like that.
Do n't think it does.
Cos I filled it all out and I do n't remember having to if there had been anything like that I'd have asked you about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I'll go in and see them and sort it out.
But.
not until Wednesday.
It wo n't be right this month either.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
No.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
I did n't see a cheque!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah it'll be nice.
Next Wednesday?
Right.
Mm.
I'm not in class next Wednesday.
No.
No.
Mhm.
I got two Helens in the group.
Luckily they've sat themselves on opposite sides of the room.
Yeah.
So I can look at one and say Helen?
Yeah!
Fine.
Better bring my book up to date.
I've.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You certainly did.
Yes I did.
It's quite strong, but.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Oh good.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Oh.
Gon na have a cup of tea in a minute?
Okay.
Well it's made.
I've only got ta.
pour it out.
Okay.
Now the problem with them doing a course the worst the worst bit is erm the Wednesday.
You're not halfway through.
Well, sometime Wednesday you go, you really go through it cos you you're not you're not halfway through but you're still but you've done quite a bit.
Yeah.
It was Wednesday night last time I did this course I felt really whacked.
Yeah.
Think erm I'm getting er oh getting better.
Things do n't throw me as much now.
Found out one, one of them used to be a staff trainer.
Yeah.
Well I actually said thank you for that and she dissolved into fits of laughter.
So I I've got to avoid no that's I wondered.
And she told me then, after that, why she'd laughed.
I said thankyou for that at the end of an exercise.
And she said and she di dissolved into fits of laughter.
And I won, and I did n't know why.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Mm.
And er so I said she dissolved into fits of laughter so after that she explained it by saying well I used to be a trainer and I know how I got to avoid the stock phrases.
You alright?
Life-sense.
No.
Well there's a couple of hours of good telly on tonight.
There's erm.
I did n't.
Sorry.
There's Telly Addicts.
And Life-sense?

A Mike Hammer film st starring Stacey on later.
Okay.
I'm with you.
Mm.
It's alright.
Yeah?
Mhm.
Yeah.
On to one.
If you do n't mind.

Yeah.

Little beetle pushing his pile of whatever along.
Yeah I see.
So when are gon na get they wo n't get, be able to get Jonathon Woss.
Yeah.
Do you know when?
Mm.
Yeah.
Do you wan na make a cup of tea?
If we're eating later.
Have we got any crisps?
I can get your tea in a minute.
Sorry.
I'll erm get some kitchen roll.
Mm.
Oh do n't do that.
Right.
I do n't mind.
I do n't mind.
You choose.
Alright?
Ah.
Is she a shepherd or just an old crook?
Oh dear.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Right.
Who can claim income support?
Erm some people under eighteen can claim.
Who are the main area of people that we deal with?
A generalization for most of the people we see coming in?
Unemployed.
Yeah.
So people who are unemployed can claim income support.
Any other people apart from people who are unemployed that can claim income support?
Low income, yes.
Anyone else?
Training courses.
Right.
They're actually paid a training allowance, which is related to income support.
But it is n't their income support.
So anything anyone else who might receive income support?
Pensioners.
Yes.
Anyone else?
Erm yes but they normally receive their erm.
their own benefits.
Yes related to disability.
But yes they can if they do n't receive enough from other means.
Yeah.
Yes.
There's.
No it's alright.
There's erm there's one other erm group of people that might be able to claim.
Yeah.
Single parents.
That's another very common one.
Yep.
Single parents.
Right.
So what factors decide what you get under income, income support?
Erm.
Yeah, yeah.
So looking at somebody's needs and what are the sort of things they're likely to take into account?
Yeah.
Income.
Er how many in the family?
Yes.
Number of dep.
Number of children.
Erm.
As well as.
Financial commitments.
Yes.
Mortgage will They will help with the mortgage.
What happens about rent?
Yeah.
They can claim housing benefit.
That is n't income support, that's another benefit that they claim from the Local Authority.
So if they're in rented accommodation then they will need to make a claim to a Local Authority for that.
What other things might D S S take into account?
Er savings.
You mentioned poll tax.
Erm another, another thing you can claim is relief from paying poll tax.
So it's not directly linked with income support.
You claim relief from the people who collect poll tax.
But the fact you are claiming income support is a factor that they look at.
So if you were in receipt of income support then you do n't have to pay very much.
Right.
You would claim that from your Local Authority.
In the same way as housing benefit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay?
Savings.
Erm something else that would relate to number of children, adults is also the age.
The ages of the people in the house.
Well once they're over eighteen age is immaterial.
But erm there, there are a couple of different rates at which er income support is claimed depending on how old the child is.
Yeah.
Right.
As I understand it there's no no banding at that end.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
But they will take into account any special help that is needed for somebody who's disabled.
So you can get special help if somebody's disabled.
Oh you're right.
There's a pension as well.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
Right.
So.
Let's have a look has any, has anyone not seen erm B one?
Right.
So how, how many do we need?
You have a look between the two.
Right.
Your rate of allowances are n't there because they go out of date so fast so I've got an extra, you can have one of these each with the rate of allowances.
And there's also you may or may not have the erm form which you claim relief for community charge and housing benefit inside the form.
Right.
So can I wipe this side off.
Right.
So if we look at a a typical family.
We have wife and husband both over eighteen.
Both over eighteen.
How much would they get?
That's it.
Sixty two pounds twenty five.
Okay?
Now if they had a child who's four years old, how much would they get?
Thirteen thirty five.
Okay?
And then another child who is sixteen.
Right.
That's right.
So.
What about if they're fourteen?
Nineteen seventy five.
There you go.
And in addition to that there is a premium because they are a family.
And the premium because they have at least one child is seven pounds ninety nine, ninety five.
That's right.
In addition to the.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay?
So.
You've got a total income coming in, er a total amount of benefit there of a hundred and three pounds thirty for this family.
Okay?
Now they will also be entitled to child benefit.
Okay?
So child benefit for two children it's ninety twenty five for the first.
Seven twenty five for the second.
So that sixteen pounds fifty.
It's not.
So the, for the oldest child it's nine pounds twenty five.
Sorry it's not on there.
Nine twenty five for the first child.
And then seven pounds twenty five for subsequent children.
Making sixteen pounds fifty in total.
This would then be treated as income by D S S and so this amount would be reduced by sixteen pounds fifty.
I make that eighty six eighty?
Yeah?
Now that's an idea to how they do it.
Do n't try to counsel somebody and tell them how much income support they're going to get.
Because that's very very basic.
There are lots and lots of other things the D S S can take into account.
Yeah.
Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau or the D S S.
Right.
Now so having issued B one, where's it got to go?
Right.
So it goes to the D S S.
Which one?
So it it's not specifically related to the benefit office where they're signing.
It's based on where they live.
And so you might find that some offices have to think of two or three D S S offices and refer various people to the, to various ones.
Depending on where they live.
Okay?
Now when you had that bundle of handouts that are all stapled together.
There was a list of the D S S offices together with guidance on their address.
Now if I can check that you've all got that.
I you have n't, I've got a list here that I can let you have.
It looks like that.
and then if you come across it later.
Okay.
Any question so far?
Okay?
Right so when do you issue a B one?
Fresh claims.
Er what do you mean by change of circumstances?
Yeah.
Erm change of let's say person's circumstances.
It might be limiting with a change of address it might not.
Yeah?
Any.
When they run out of U B.
Yes.
Any other times when you might issue one?
Erm situation where you have somebody who has left their job.
Was n't clear at the time what the circumstances were.
You may find when you have the reply back from the employer that you have to suspend unemployment benefit.
In that instance you could issue a B one so that he would have some money coming in.
So if unemployment benefit is suspended and erm another circumstance which might arise is somebody expects to receive unemployment benefit and then finds that they're not entitled to it.
Because of contribution problems.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
They may the only thing is they may not wish to take one.
You do n't have to, you do n't have to claim.
And they may say no no I do n't want to claim.
In which case that's fair enough.
But at some future time they may decide they want to.
Sorry?
Refuses U B?
Mhm.
Mhm.
That's a very good er very good precaution to take, yes.
Very good idea.
So before we issue before we hand over the B one what do we do?
We fill in the back.
Yes?
.We'll be giving you some exercises later about filling in the back.
Erm.
No, no it does n't have to be an E O.
Right.
Erm the only thing is what does happen occasionally is somebody comes from the D S S offices and they've been told, I need a B one.
What they have n't been told is that you actually have to make a claim for benefit.
And have to sign on every fortnight.
And yes.
And, and so then they, they're a bit miffed that instead of the B one they're being asked to complete a U B four six one, a U B six seven one.
They then have to come to an appointment and be interviewed.
Whereas in actual fact I do n't want all this, I want is a B one.
But they have to make a claim before you can issue a B one.
That's right.
In fact D S S do n't issue B ones.
We, we have to issue B ones.
Good question.
How long does it take for income support to come through?
Once a claim has been made.
How long is a piece of string?
Five and a half days?
Right.
I, I would I would have thought it could have, could take, it could easily take ten days.
Mm.
They can get a crisis loan.
They do n't, they can also get paid early direct by the D S S.
D S S will actually pay them rather than telling us to pay them.
That's right.
So if you get someone in that situation who's saying I'm desperate for money, I'm claiming income support, I've heard nothing and you have n't been told how much they're entitled to.
Then they can actually go to the D S S office and say that they need some money urgently and D S S may make a payment.
Yeah.
It depends on the circumstances and you're not, you're not in a position to say what D S S will or wo n't do.
So you can only say they may make a payment.
under er I think they would do under most circumstances.
It would only be if they suspected that something odd was going on.
Okay and how do D S S tell us how much to pay income support?
Yep.
B two.
Right.
Before I ask you to complete B one there's one more thing we need to talk about.
And that is about what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord.
So what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord, what happens to their unemployment benefit.
Yeah.
That's right.
So what, what's the difference?
Right.
But when, when the adjudication officer has made a decision he will then allow or disallow.
So that that's the so at first the claim is suspended.
And then when you have a decision from the adjudication officer it is then allowed or disallowed.
And then they can appeal.
Yeah.
That's right, yes.
Well.
It went up in stages.
It went to thirteen weeks and then it went to twenty six weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah that's just what I was going to say.
What happens then, to income support?
It's paid at a reduced rate for the period of the suspension.
Sorry it's, it's, if it's allowed they would have a reason income support to pay.
If it's disallowed then erm they would have their entitlement in that they would be paid a reduced rate during the period of the susp, er of the disallowance.
Right.
Once we're out of the twenty six week period it would go back to its normal rate.
Mhm.
That's right yes.
Yes, but at a reduced reduced rate.
I'm sorry.
I'll go on to talk about that.
Right.
I've got a handout on the reduced rate, yes.
And I'm gon na be giving you a handout which gives you information about how to calculate it.
What, what do we call that reduction, deduction?
Right.
Yep.
I do n't know if you've heard that term at all around.
What does it stand for?
Yep.
oh.
Let's try that again.
Unemployed deduction.
Okay?
Details of any reductions that have been made are held in enquiry screen four.
The reduction is made on the personal rate available.
So in this instance it would be made on half, if, if the husband had left his job of his own accord it would be made on half of that amount.
No no no.
No that's why it would only be it would be made your deduction would be made on half of that amount.
No, no.
The deduction is based on.
No.
It's, yeah.
And it is forty percent of that.
So.
Yes.
I'm just trying to.
Thirty one.
Yep.
That's right.
Yes.
It's made on the amount that that person, that individual is receiving in income support.
It's not on the whole family.
Yeah.
Just the the individual and that one portion of the income support is reduced by forty percent.
Yeah.
It's about twelve pounds a week.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
There are exceptions.
So that the majority of people will be subject to a forty percent deduction on their personal benefit and their personal rate.
Okay?
That's right.
Erm the deduction will only made, be made if a suspension is held on our computer.
So if somebody forgets to put the suspension on.
Mm.
Yeah.
No.
No that's fine.
It's alright.
Yes.
Mhm.
Yeah.
That's right.
For the period of the disallowance.
And it would then revert back to full rate.
Yeah.
Okay?
Right.
Erm the some people can actually have a reduction made of twenty percent instead.
If, in this family the wife was expecting a baby then then it would be a twenty percent deduction.
Also if one or other of the partners, well it would have to be the partner that was n't signing was seriously ill then the reduct deduction would be twenty percent.
Providing there's a condition attached, that they have savings of less than two hundred pounds.
Right.
I hope this does n't cause you a problem, but the rates of benefit have changed very slightly since the first of October ninety one.
And the handout I've got here which I could n't tie in just now when I was trying to do the deduction is because the rates are very slightly different.
It's about thirty pence or so more.
Than actually what we were talking about.
So I'm sorry about that.
I'll get the other one updated.
Erm but what you've got now if you, can I pass those round and I'll explain what that says.
Oh you had one in the wad did you?
Oh it's been a good week.
Right.
If you'd have a look at that.
The appendix age twenty the category which you can see there, nought to four.
That tells you the amount of income support which the deduc er for which the deduction is appropriate.
Right some are April, some of October and they're all mixed up.
Wonderful.
Okay, October you want, you want, anyone else need October.
And if you please destroy the other one.
Yeah, that's the latest one.
Right Okay have a look at that.
The B U category nought to four.
That shows the amount of weekly rate to which the can be applied.
So that shows how much we're gon na apply our deduction to.
Okay?
And we can see the rates for which the deduction is going to be applied the other side.
So erm a single under eighteen or couple both under eighteen twenty three pound ninety.
That re, that should relate to the allowances you had before.
So if a forty percent deduction is made on category two, then somebody receiving thirty one pounds forty a week would actually, it would actually be reduced by twelve pounds fifty five.
Do you see how that works?
Right.
If you look at category two.
Yeah.
They're in receipt of thirty one pounds forty?
So if you look at category two down below.
Forty percent deduction applied for a full week.
Twelve pound fifty five.
Okay?
So the B U category shows the amount of income support that er is being, that the deduction is being based on.
And then the B U indicator indicates whether it's rate one or rate two and indicates whether it's a twenty percent or forty percent deduction.
Now right at the beginning of a claim you can have an odd number of days before the first benefit week ending day.
There will also be an indicator on the B two to say how those days should be treated.
There will be a number which will be the number, should be the number of days before the benefit week ending day in the first week of the claim.
Right.
Any questions on that?
Mhm?
Right.
Yes.
Right.
You can go so far as to say that I mean, you will be safe in saying that if your, that as your benefit is suspended your income support for you, not for your family but for you, will be reduced.
It will probably be reduced by forty percent.
.. Yeah?
Yeah.
We'll be having a look at some B two's and we'll pick up this bit about and er the coding when you have a look at that.
Yes.
Yes that's right.
Okay?
Right.
So I've now got a handout for you and it'll be up to date about how to complete a B one.
Yeah, anybody else want to stretch their legs a second?
No, Okay?

Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a pound yeah I know.
Alright.
And that's e.
Well that's not high.
Well what's happening here is all the cars are stopped and there all one behind the other.
sorry I.
Oh.
No there's been an accident Christine.
Yeah.
There are pe some people are going down erm Shallard's Road.
Mm.
So if you went along Shallard's Road.
Came out of Long Beach Road we'll miss it.
Or you could go down California Road.
Yeah.
and along Long Beach.
or you could carry on along California Road.
you.
If you went on down California Road and went down into Oldland.
by Christine's school.
then you could come off the roundabout from Kachenend.
Do n't know Christine.
No.
No there's not hold up up there.
Well what I saw was some tail lights going along the road.
Aha.
Yeah somebody's hurt.
Ah.
Yeah that's what I was thinking it's funny it's sort of Christmas makes everything better or worse.
Bad things for a bad thing to happen over Christmas, it's worse.
happens.
it it's better it's makes every thing more intense somehow.
Yep but I have n't.
I have n't succumbed yet this year have I?
Or have we did we buy something when we were going round er.
No no we have n't bought anything yet.
No well that will be our that will be our Christmas trimmings that we bought this year.
yeah.
No.
Still he's a learner again.
Yes he is ha ha he's breaking the law anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah it did n't hold us up but there was an accident.
Yeah.
It's alright.
I would have slowed down a lot more than that.
Yeah that's right no reflection on you it's just that I'm thinking oh I ca I just ca n't see the time when I would ever drive through a gap like that that confidently that's all.
But it'll come.
Ah yeah you eased off that's all.
Only I would have probably braked, changed down ended up in second and crept past it on the inside and then speeded up again.
I do n't perhaps not that bad but I would have definitely braked and not just eased off on the accelerator.
Mm.
A service.
Ah.
Yeah.
Mm modification to lifestyle.
needed.
Oh no.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh Brian annoyed me on my lesson I pulled up to the Kingsway right?
And I was wanting to turn left.
going along the Kingsway coming back from the driv the driving test centre.
yeah?
And there's a filter light and he said oh you'll be waiting here ages put it in neutral just as.
just as I did it the bloody filter light came on.
and you oh.
Mhm.
Good grief wha I always have to put the handbrake on at traffic lights.
Mm yeah Brian's argument to that is that er if you've got if you were hit in the back.
you would tend to raise your foot off the brake sort of jump and take your foot off the brake and you'd go forward and hit the car in front.
Mm.
yeah.
yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
It only makes you slower away.
Mm.
Mm.
But ha I remember I was on my test and I pulled round er it was very, very busy and there were two rows of cars and I pulled up and I thought right there's a gap down there and I want to go straight on and all these others were turning le turning right so I squeezed down through the gap and then I thought right I'm gon na be here a little while shall I put it in neutral, blow no I wo n't.
So gi given the unless somebody's out unless you're if he'd actually tells me to do it I will say I was sort of oh alright and do it.
Yeah but mm.
Mm.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.

No I'll sit at the back.
No.
Right thanks.
Mm.
Ah I know no.

That's alright that's plenty garden.
Yeah, yeah and down there.
I know they are.
Cos I did erm I was thinking we're going through this fairly quickly are they really taking it in so I s we stopped after I re reached a certain point and I spent the next sort of half an hour or so just asking them questions and some of the things they got right, some they got wrong so I went back over them until we got it right so sort of help to confirm things.
What this?
Mm.
I do n't know what it's like mm.
Yeah sort of warm.
These rugby shirts are they're very expensive it's amazing there's no way really that they should be overall I suppose it it's cos it's a bit of a cross between a sweatshirt and er but still eighte eighteen pound.
Eighteen pound for a shirt and the they're lovely these I do like them but ooh.
They're not as warm as a sweatshirt.
Mm.
Because it's fashionable.
Well not.
Mm.
Yes.
Mother!
She showed us the map on the last day before it due in eight o'clock.
Yeah eight o'clock Wednesday night she showed it us the map.
I heard Brad having a conversation again today about Ooh I do n't feel ye I heard him saying why do n't we feel very happy about this and not and not happy with the subjects and I do n't feel very happy about running the session so go up this way he's never done the work you see so he's trying to learn it from i instructions and things and a lot of the time you need to have actually done it to be able to talk about it.
So it's not his his fault but a lot of the training that we have to deliver is to do with procedures that he had n't dealt with whereas a lot of the procedures are things that I'm familiar with there's only some the job centre stuff.
Yeah.
No and I've got the erm I have n't got any experience in job centre work.
but the job centre work is n't as complicated.
Oh good.
Right right.
So you have to assume everything's okay.
because they have n't told you.
Good fine this is the way we operate.
There's less in the jars than in the tins or although the.
tins look look smaller.
Yeah.
If that's alright?
Mm.
That's the other one.
No.
It's alright.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
No I know sorry?
How are you doing alright?
And Robin?

You ca n't see a thing round that corner can you?
Mm.

Oh that's the little microphone from the.
thing I'm doing.
From the st survey I'm doing about spoken English.
Yeah I've recording things an now again er it's all done anonymously, they're coming I've done quite well actually I'm on tape number eleven I've rec recorded eleven tapes now of.
various bits and pieces and er they're coming back tomorrow night to collect it all it's been quite interesting.
Mm.
You see an amazing difference in him though, he's much more outgoing.
What are you sniffing about for eh?
Oh.
Well thanks Mum.
No.
He's getting cheeky.
I do n't understand that word.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm we got off.
Yeah.
We got about two did n't we?
We got two two presents?
That's not bad.
Let's have a look.
These they do n't.
they do n't join onto the trunk like that.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
No get, let start off yep on erm show you.
on a bit of paper.
Can you turn that up.
No they do n't they cross over and they tangle up but once a branch starts off it does n't join on to another one.
A cris-cross.
Mm.
No I don ' know what you mean.
You see that one would sort of.
carry on going and that one would go up behind it.
Mhm.

I see.
I think you need to make that a bit thicker so it divides into two.
Yeah but there is n't a flat top it divides sort of in the middle.
Do see what I mean?
There is n't a flat top it divides sort of.
down the middle.
Yeah?
No.
Mhm.
Right so if you mark in where you want it to split.
Down the middle so put the pencil sort of in the middle.
and draw the the middle bit first do you see what I mean?
Yeah and the other side.
That's it.
Then you take that and taper down a bit and then it's gon na split again.
Mhm.
Mm you split it down the middle again so that will go off that way and then that branch go that way see?
And then it splits again and splits again.
Mhm.
See the branches get smaller and smaller and smaller.
Mhm.
Whatever you like dear it can bend round and.
But if you were to split that one and that one again ca n't you?
No do n't get thicker.
Oh I see that's your.
yeah.
Mhm.
So now you can work on that one.
Cos you you fill it in.
with other branches, you see.
Mm.
They needed to write.
a bit more and start making a bit more.
Three D mm?
And how you can that you could draw imagine there's a branch.
growing out that way and then curving up see what I mean?
Mm but work so.
behind so it it's it's growing that way.
and then up so you scr draw it starting to coming up like that.
That's right.
It's that.
Then you can split split it several times as well.
Well draw.
It'll look less the more branches you draw.
the more real it will look like.
Come on.
Well you wan na split it as often as you can.
And he'll put up with being stroked as well.
Mm.
Mm.
Know how to do it properly.
Have you drawn the have n't you drawn in another branch yet?
Oh right.
Mm.
Yes it does.
Mhm.
Mm.
No you have to do draw another branch coming out of there and there and there and there and you know?
Apart from his chest he's the only bit of white on him, is n't it?
Oh no just a little bit of feet on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Mm that's alright.
It's alright, Christine.
No you you draw lower branches off the off here.
Well that's right.
Yeah looks alright.
Just leave it like that.
Mhm.
No you you do n't have to rub out the line you can just draw another one as if it's coming out from a bit you ca n't see.
You've got a branch like that.
branch like that.
Alright?
And then you could have.
something growing out the back.
again so you sort of.
Do n't make it too thin.
Mm it does n't really look as if it it's got ta be about that thick coming down do you see what I mean?
They're not not that thick but certainly that thick.
Yeah?
And then divide down like the others.
Aha.
Mhm.
And another one.
Alright.
It needs to be thicker and that end.
You're doing fine!
Just do n't give up now.
That's cos you're not getting.
Yes.
Oh it's cold innit?
Yes I know what you mean He's not the nervous little thing he was.
