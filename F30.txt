It's halibut.

No?
Well if I tell you a little secret about this.
It's up at the fish shop in Framlingham.

So.
Coley is two ninety five a pound.
And halibut fillet is two sixty.
Yes.
Well yes, mm.
Mm.

Mm.
That's much nicer than cod.
A great big piece of hake.
and with as if it was chicken with erm parsley thyme stuffing.
a little bit of bacon.
and it was baked and that was lovely!
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Is that hake?

Mm mm.
I've never known it as that.
Absolutely incredible!
Really?
the field.
I thought it was a bit early yet, there's a frost is n't it now?
No I mean that erm if you cut the grass just before frost it does n't like it does it?
But when, that's right.

Mm.

Yeah.
And sometimes they just.
next time.
No.
No.
No.
Three feet from the wall from your.
You need n't do anything horrid to them, terrible!
I mean, you can just er.
a wire cage.
them.
No.
Oh!
My father always used to do that for his crocuses because the birds loved the yellow ones, do n't they?
Mm.
And his daffs, he was going to use his, lose his yellow crocuses of the year so he spread black cotton.
and they jolly well learned.
that that's what.
that it.
was there!
Mm.
Mm.

How much.
Well I've got millions!
Oh!
We've got some have we?
Well I did n't know.
Oh!
Mm.
Mm.
But do you mean that they would n't try and.
visit if you had your own moles?
I see.
I consider four moles are too dense.
No, I'm doing fine thank you darling.
But please encourage other people to have some.
Why not!
Mollie, you know that my I dislocated my jaw in November mm.
Just eating a sandwich!
Cheese sandwich.
I do n't know!
Mm.
And it clicked and I, well occasionally before and very occasionally and I.
I just the slightest sort of movement has readjusted it and this would not move at all!
And erm I'm shovelling food now because it's so difficult!
I still ca n't get it any wider.
Mm.

By the way those did I tell you they put me on some tablets to re to erm to erm.
relax the muscles,.
Yes,.
Well there must be something in it because I feel so relaxed these days I ca n't get.

Yes, she went with a yes she has.
I phoned her on the fourth night to say goodnight to her that was all.
spoken to her in the meantime.
and she was actually, at nine o'clock.
erm well in bed.
Mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
But she can be very, she can be very secluded there.
She can be just.
Have you?
Yes, absolutely!
I'm astonished.
At six weeks,.
I do n't even.
think that in those days anybody would have considered taking a child out like that, you know!
They do it now!
It drives me.
me up the wall!
Erm the things they will do for these new little things.
I never used to feel.
that mine were really here until they.
You do n't like motorbikes and side cars do you Mollie?
Oh yes.
Mm mm.
Oh! oh! oh!

Oh dear!
I bet she was.
I bet she was.
Now this is where the meal gets a little bit French because I have sauce to deal with.
So you are left with erm conversation.
No thank you darling.
That's.
that's the, that's the wrong thing to do!
That's quite.
true.
That's right darling.
No, I did come.
He did n't.
Yes, that's true.
That's true.
Absolutely!
Oh sorry!
Now Mollie that's, I have n't given you a large helping but it's a ginger pudding.
I've been dying to make a good ginger pudding for years!
So wait and see if it's any good, I do n't know.
Sauce!
I should think on this.
It it.
moistens it.
It's an egg custard so it's, you know it's worthy.
of your attention.
Oh!
Heavens!
Come on have some!
And it's only small helpings because you can come for more, okay?

Smart girl!
They're good for you.
I wish I liked them.
because erm I think they.
I think.
Yes.
What I've done with these is er.
er.
Parboil them.
And.
then pop them into.
and pop them in with the.
and.
Oh I love the jacket!
The birds do you see.
Do n't they, they love it!
That's right.

We have n't one that comes on our.
it's just.
at the last minute now.
I do n't like cats.
The Scot er we call him what do we call the Scot who lives along the way?
Edgar!
We call him Edgar, is.
that a first name?

Next door to the Post Office.

Why Mark's at her?
Perhaps he has boys there so it's not surprising you get them.
No.
Mm.
Ah?
Do erm.
Oh.
really!
We well was it to her that you said.
do n't you dare come over.
here smoking?
Yes, yes, mm.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
Well John thinks everything German is that.
much superior to everything British!
So.
the blasted erm.
Germans in the factory now you see!
Mm.
I do n't think they're any better workers than ours.
on the whole.
No, I do n't think they are.
Not for.
a minute!
I said that, as a matter of fact, absolutely so!
You try telling John that!
Oh it's common knowledge you see.
Mm.
Quite rightly!
And yet, we have them over here.
Absolutely!
We had a letter a few.
weeks ago, at Christmas time from erm the er, what is it?
Spain, Portuguese.
er.
family that we know and th, they're, one of their sons is fo erm in London I suppose erm adapt here and he's rather upset because she is now coming over to Britain to work for Telecom!
Now why?
I do n't see it!
And I do n't think they.
Yes exactly!
Mm.
It's ridiculous really!
I trust you wo n't be any more churlish, telling her not to smoke in the wood shop!
Yes!
I think so!
Mm!
Yes!
Mm!
Yes.
That's not quite.
the same.
He is.
Oh absolutely!
Yes!
He's just got Chelmsford Cathedral.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Mm.
And St. John's College, Cambridge.
Could I tempt somebody?
A slither.
Well it's got real ginger in it, I think that makes.
it so good does n't.
it?
Do you know this was on Food and Drink last week on er, on the television.
That's right.
And help yourself to the, I'm sad to say that that has curdled since I put it in the jug, do you want me to change it?
Do you ever cheat and put a little of cornflour.
Mm.
And I thought I'd caught it.
And I had caught it, it was all over.
Er no, it's erm a flavouring beginning with R.
is the.
er ground ginger of course.
And then the.
stem ginger.
Will you have a soupcon more?
in syrup.
Yes.
The fresh ginger.
Oh the dry ginger.
ugh!
Like rocks is n't it?
It's li, it's like rocks is n't it?
Mm!
Mm!
used to it, yeah.
Mm.
Which is n't what you wanted.
You put it into casseroles and things or into the fruit.

I think mostly flavour it, I I I suppose you can eat it but.
But you can eat it.
to do a ginger, I I've eaten ginger of that kind.
beat it i in Chinese dishes.
Mm.
It is good piece I hope?
Mm.
If I went to put it in, I was gon na say and I went to put it in er cos it dries off does n't it?
If I were to put it in er stewed apples or something I would n't eat the actual ginger but in a casserole, it's nice.
Mm.
Mm.
I do n't.
Yes.
Yes.
I've got a lot of, quite of lot of dry ginger, dried ginger.
Erm a little bit more just a touch more Mollie?
None?
I can remember the first time I ever.
came across dry ginger one of my school girlfriends was giving me a recipe, which, for which one er fo for erm ginger beer.
for Christmas, and it was delicious the way her mother made it so she started it with me writing it down, see, and she told me the ingredients and then she said you brews the ginger I thought.
brews the ginger?
Fancy her saying it!
She was my grammar school friend, you see.
You brews the ginger, so I thought well I'm blessed!
And of course it was ages before I knew she meant bruise.
Once I started to make it I realized, o what it was.
B R U I S E.
But it sounded very.
peculiar!
I must say!

Ooh!

Looks like a canal on there.

Yeah, it's a wet tarmac.
That's the bit they've knocked down to the put the Smiths and that, the other side of it, this bit.

The coaches used to go through there.
The same as the roads were n't it?

That's nice!
So you're sitting in here at the moment are you Stanley?
Why not, indeed!
It is the bitterest morning that I've.
Thanks, it's lovely!
Oh that's a beauty!
Is n't it?
And what is the fi, is the kitchen erm chimney needing to be swept or something then?
Er, I mean the dining room, sorry!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Aha.
Oh that's a pity because that's the room that you.
use a lot is n't it?
Aha.
Yes.
That's true.
Yes it's lovely!
My goodness it's erm we were all saying yesterday it was summer!
Noel cut the grass yesterday can you believe it?
And I did.
Yes.
And I weeded the front garden, some of it.
Erm and now look at it today!
It's really cold!
Yes.
Yes.
It does!
It does!
Yes.
And er, it was funny yesterday morning the birds in the village were singing just in the way they do in the spri, in the spring, you know, first light.
And I thought gosh, if they do n't know what's.

That's true.
Well that's true!
But you see you take it for granted.
Tell me Stanley erm, I brought your medicine from the doctor.
er, was that because you've not been well this week or just is it a, ro routine replacement or something?
Yes, but I, it's not because you've not been well?
Oh that's fine.
Yes I know.
I know.
I know.
Oh!
It's sad is n't it?
It really is, it's sad!
Mm.
Mm.
I do n't think he.
Yes.
Absolutely!
Absolutely!
I mean, it does n't stop him from going shooting and fishing does it?
Possibly, yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Ye, yes that's right, mm.
Yes, they do, they do, it's a shame!
Of course not!
No.
Yes.
Aha.
Yes.
Yes, that's.
true.
No.
No!
No!
Well they just think they're in a privileged position Stanley!
And the only privilege they have is of looking after us is n't it?
Really!
And getting well.
paid for it!
Absolutely!
That's right!
Yes, absolutely!
Oh dear oh dear!
Oh heck!
Yes.
Yes.
It should n't do, no.
Oh she's called Jean.
She's very nice!
Jean, her name.
I do n't know her other name.
A very nice person.
She is.
That's right.
That's right.
Yes.
Very nice!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
No.
People complain that these tests seem to take longer than they need to.
Whether the hold up is at the hospital or in the erm surgery I.
honestly do n't know!
But it does seem to take a while.
Oh what have I done?
What?
Oh!
Oh it's just a.
Yes I can Stanley it's just a.
it's just an outdated bill.
That's all, came out of my.
pocket.
Absolutely!
That's right!
No, he's not a, I do n't think he's as a as some.
He is wonderful!
He.
My gosh, he's wonderful!
Everybody wants him you know.
I should think his list is absolutely full by now.
Erm, the first time I met him was when he was doing a very tricky stitching job, I took Mollie up.
because she'd cut her leg.
and er I took her up there and her si, skin is like tissue paper.
I do n't know how that man managed to get the two edges to meet but he did a wonderful job on it!
And he was so nice to her when he was doing it.
You're very nice!
Oh yes!
Lucky girl!
Those people who live there in, up in Framlingham are very lucky!
And those people who live near enough.
you see, to the main surgery.
That's right.
Oh yes!
Yes.
A tummy upset?
Oh, not erm shingles?
Oh!
Gosh!
Mm.
No, it was n't.
You see, that's another one.
No, he did n't feel, absolutely.
Stanley!
No, that's not.
Yes.
No it is n't!
No it's not.
Tha abs.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes, they get, they're a bit less committed.
I think the.
Yes.
Yes, that's true.
Mhm.
There's another very nice one there, he's the latest to have come erm.
oh and he's just.
Yes.
And he's very young, he's i, I met him twice, when I was with people who were dying.
and erm in fact, yes, but both of just had died and we sent for the doctor and it's.
it was he who came and erm he was absolutely marvellous!
I thought his manner was just right.
Oh yes!
It does make a lot of.
difference, yes.
They can!
They can.
I mean, th there is something to be said for the manner towards you is n't there?
Yes.
That's true.
That's true.
Oh absolutely!
Absolutely!
Yes!
That's right.
That's true.
He should.
I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the me, medical profession the more people are paid the less committed they seem to be to the job!
Yes.
They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job itself!
Mm.
That's what I feel.
Yes.
I'm sorry about it because you know, how I feel about the medical profession and the nursing.
profession.
Ye, I mean I'm passionately keen!
But erm I I think some of them let us down a bit.
Mm.
Oh yes, if they want to come it does n't matter if it's convenient to you or not does it!
That's true.
That's true.
Yes.
That's right, you do n't.
That's true.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
it is true with some.
of them.
Ah, that's right!
That's right.
That's right.
Absolutely!
And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are in these big cities!
You know, they have a nicer time of it here altogether do n't they?
Yes.
They do.
Mhm.
He does.
Oh yes!
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, he's in Debenham now.
Mm.
He did.
Yes.
Er, I think he does live at Debenham.
Yes.
I know he operates from there anyway.
Mm.
Yes.
No.
Really?
Aha.
Yes.
That's what the hospital said!
Remember?
Yes.
Yes.
Well you would n't be ninety five if you were weakling would you Stanley?
Really?
Fancy!
He knew, you see.
Yes.
Yes.
Well he was.
said that, yes, yes.
Aha.
No, they do n't often refer to one another do they?
You see it's not thought to be the thing.
to do.
Ah!
Yes.
Oh he was a, he was a lovely man, was n't he, Doctor?
Did he?
Yes.
Yes, well of course they.
Did he?
Yes.
Oh he was a real gentleman.
Wonderful!
Oh, was he?
Aha.
Is that so?
My God!
Did they?
Did they?
Is he?
Does he really?
They're very keen are n't they?
Aha.
Some.
Noel's not keen on them, he's been asked to become a Mason sometimes.
but he just, it's not, somehow it's hi, not his sort of thing.
Mhm.
Mm.
Well you've.
had plenty to do to fill your time without belonging to.
that sort of thing.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Really?
That's right.
Oh yes!
Mm.
From the.
Mhm.
Really?
Mhm.
Oh yes.
Oh!
Yes.
Mhm.
Oh good gracious!
Mm.
Really?
Mhm.
Really?
Aha.
Goodness!
Goodness!
Oh well that's awful Stanley!
Yes, oh that's awful!
Mm.
Oh dear!
Oh!
Oh!
Dear oh dear!
Oh, that is dreadful!
Mm.
Mm.
That's dreadful!
Mm.
No, I do n't reme, no, I do n't remember.
that name.
Ah yeah.
Mhm.
No.
Mhm.
No, you were talking about er about your cousin Mr.
Yes.
Mm.
Mhm.
Oh yes!
Aha.
Mhm.
Really?
Mm mm.
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
Yes.
Mhm.
That was good.
Is that so?
Mm mm.
Mm.
Good on you!
That's right, and you did n't need anybody else's!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Yes.
Yes.
That you did n't want it.
Mhm.
Yes your independence.
means a lot.
Ha.
Yes.
Yes.
Really?
Aha.
Yes.
Oh yes!
And it's done you no harm.
has it Stanley?
It's done you no harm to stand on your own feet has it?
No.
No.
That's the way.
If only people would be a bit more like that sometimes today.
Yes.
That's right.
Yes.
Oh it's the best way to be Stanley.
It's the best way to be.
Aha.
Right.
That's right.
Ah, they caught them.
That's right.
No.
No.
Jolly good!
That's right!
Absolutely!
I I do n't know, by the way, there ar, your gate is open and there is a er, red van out there.
They do, oh!
Th, oh for me did you?
Ah, that's sweet of you!
So when I go you'd like me to shut it probably would you?

Oh no!
Well it does n't take me a minute.
I just wondered whether it was because the erm men with the red van at the gate there.
are doing something here.
They're working are they?
Ah, so you did.
That's sweet of you!
That's kind!
Stanley I do not.
erm yeah?
Oh yes, indeed it does!
Oh it.
does!
And we've got them too, Stanley!
We've got them!
I think we've got all sorts!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, yes.
Mm.
That's true.
Mm.
Mhm.
No.
That's right Stanley.
It's.
Yes.
That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of bank lending's been going on have n't you?
Mm.
It's madness really!
Mhm.
Yes, they do.
That's right.
They have, I'm afraid, they have!
And now of course they're paying the price too because.
they're in a mess!
Absolutely!
That's right.
It is really.
That's right, because they have n't.
had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see.
They've borrowed.
it instead.
Yes, that's right.
But a lot of people.
That's true in many cases that's true.
Yes, they have Stanley.
It's very foolish!
Could n't last, could it?
It was n't reality.
That's right.
Mhm.
They do n't work out how much they're paying for their money.
do they?
No.
It is really!
Is really.
That's right.
They ca n't manage.
Mhm.
Yes.
Well they did.
Certainly, they did.
And they will again, Stanley!
If we get the wrong people in.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
Mhm.
That's right.
That's right Stanley.
Yes, and then they are.
Absolutely!
Yes.
It is!
Well that's the trouble, they do!
Yes.
They do.
Exactly!
Exactly, and then they lose the lot then do n't they?
I got erm Patsy coming in for a bite of lunch.
erm because we did n't see her last week.
And we.
Oh you need to Stanley wo n't you?
Because er I ca n't bear to think of you without this room with that lovely fire in.
Oh yes, the birds are there still are n't they?
Here's some fat for them.
That's your medicine Stanley.
Are n't they marvellous!
They come straight away do n't they?
They're wonderful!
That's your medicine there your eggs there.
Sorry?
Oh.
Oh, it says, Stanley well you can read it I'm sure.
Please repeat the water test when you've finished the tablets.
Repeat the water test.
when you've finished the tablets.
Yes.
Yes.
After you've taken those.
I sho, I suppose so.
Can I just check?
I'm sure they will.
I'm sure they will Stanley.
Whoops!
Yes, that one's two tablets twice a day and that's for the water test.
Alright?
Er.
bu, you take that to, er two tablets twice a day that's it.
Two tablets twice a day.
So that's probably.
morning and evening.
They are perhaps new ones, I do n't know.
Are they?
Yes.
Two twice a day.
And then this is for your water test.
When those are finished.
Yes.
That's just to put the water in to put your urine in you see.
Let me see it before, ooh I must n't open it because it'll be ste.
it'll be sterile, you see.
It is, it's.
He wants that, yo, he wants you to put some water in that for a test, some of your water in that.
for a test.
After you've used those.
And Stanley, we do n't open that in the meantime because.
it's sterile.
And so it must be for your test, you see?
Okay?
Yes.
Two twice a day.
Yes.
It is.
Yes.
That's right!
That's it.
That's right.
Oh yes, well er er, yes you can because you need to send it down when it's fresh.
Er, so if nobody's going down give me a ring and I'll come and get it.
Alright?
So erm.
your fat, what.
Well er, only if she's going.
Yes.
That's right.
There's the fat Stanley.
It's one twenty nine please.
Er, one twenty nine Stanley.
Please.
If you've got a ten, I've got a one.
Ah.
Good!
That's clever.
You almost always have change do n't you?
Almost always have the right change.

Yes.
There.
You're very welcome Stanley.
And I'll see you again next week, but if you need anything in the meantime give me a ring will you?
Do that dear.
And, try to keep warm and keep out of this wind.
Bye bye dear!
And I'll shut the gate.
Okay, so you tha, you do n't need to come out at all.
There we are.
It's keen!
Yes it is.
Right.
Bye bye then Stanley!
Bye bye!
But Noel, is n't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit is n't it?
Oh come off it.
Ooh sorry.
No I'm sure it is n't.
Because swimming's.
Well yes that's a beast.
Ah yes.
That's a violent one is n't it, squash?
I, I ca n't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it?
Something that's more measured.
I think so too probably, and you've been used to it.
That let's us off, is n't it nice?
Yes.
Have you got someone properly qualified taking them?
Mm.
I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow because that's the proper end is n't it?
That borders on the nasty I think.
That's it.
I should apologize for canned soup, but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning.
you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm so I er could n't make a proper soup, sorry, but this is.
good actually I think.
Heinz tomato.
Yes, ideal.
What did you use for your stock?
And?
Carrot?
Celery?
That gives a lovely flavour.

During.
Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make.
Mhm.
All that hair.
Yuk.
Where they gorgeous marrow bones?
That.
Oh yes, they make wonderful stock do n't they?
Mm.
I always feel that when he's giving,, because he gives them to one, does n't charge for any.
er anything for the bones, one can hardly say erm give that another whack across the knuckle because.
the big knuckle has so much locked inside.
it does n't it?
Do you?
I should really.
I ought to have courage.
Yes he, you're right, mhm.
No but that is erm er a counsel of perfection or something is n't it?
It it's a method anyway.
Erm do you?
What in fact does it do?
It gives it colour erm I'm sure because of the, of the fact that they're roasted.
There's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour, is once I've taken off the outside skin of the onion, the very outside.
I put the next one in.
I read that somewhere, mm.
But roasting them, I would n't like to get them with any sort of burnt taste.
Mm.
Mm, yes.
Oh yes she's good.
And she tells you to do that does she?
It's the matter of the moment really, you just fling them into a roasting tin do n't you and put it in the oven?
And that's alright if you've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start.
heating it up, mm.
Mm.
Oh good, tell me about it.
Mm.
Oh.
Is that to get you ri to get rid of the patients he did n't want?
The S A S man was?
Why?
You mean the official government line?
Yes.
Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately.

But I, I had no idea that he then had to be that, being given his own funding, he then had to be organized by a committee.
Oh that's outrageous.
Well it does n't seem sensible, I thought it was the G Ps getting control.
I mean this is what's going to happen to the detriment of the health service right through.
administration by people who do n't know what it's all about.
Is it because they're going to incorporate a lot of high tech treatments?
Mm and, you see erm it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds nowadays because.
the, the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were.
They'll have something special for them like concentration camps.
Is that so?
I wonder how it really goes.
I wonder.
Oh this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who'll knows what he requires and what his patients require was going to have erm a pretty er erm.

You, you know?
Ah.
Oh do tell me because I.
And how do they?
Yes?

Really?
They've dearly gone on for years not knowing, let alone tonsillectomies, what.
these wretched erm.
transplants costs.
Yes it is.
Because er er ya absol.
Well it does I suppose.
It does.
Oh have they?
I did n't hear that.
I say.
Ah!
Yes!
I did hear of that.
I'm sorry I was n't relating it to erm to polio.
Erm.
Erm.
Yes they do you see.
That's the doubtful one is n't it, because it's gone.
It's supposed to be completely gone.
No I do n't think no I do n't think we have smallpox inoculation er of, of children do we?
Because they say it's it's, it's gone completely.
Erm sorry love we need a fork for that.
Perhaps the meat fork from the shop would do nicely.
No er er erm it's all in the cutting, of course it is very no that's pork and Noel dare n't touch it so I've got two slices so that you and I could have one.
And Noel will have the other.
Erm.
it's so new to them that they're bothering to cost it, but how did we go on in the older days?
I'm trying to think.
Did we know anything about what our operations were costing?
I ca n't remember.
Yes a figure that's been around that anyway, yes.
Ya.
I'm just having that to start with I think.
It would n't relate to what it costs.
Yes, that's right.
That's what it that'll be it.
I bet it does n't relate to an actual operation in a general hospital because you've got so many people wanting their rake off in a private one surely?
I mean have n't you?
That erm.
Ya that's right.
Oh because of Richard?
I'm convinced that.
you know Richard er er?
Had he gone to a National Health hospital.
with the request to have that back thing done for him.
I'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do they would have said do n't bother.
Ya.
And er would have erm perceived that he was n't greatly hampered by it, but once you've got a surgeon who is going to get a fat fee he did say to him are you sure you want this done.
but Richard was sure he wanted it done and nothing came between him and that intention.
And you see he's, it's going to finish him.
He's not going to get better.
Oh yes it's known that he did.
He said er you're sure because it was quite a thought, for a man his age.
But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said look here I do not recommend this.
That is the danger.
He would.
So er the end was I suppose always connectable.
Mm.
Mm they will, it's more permissive if you're in the private sector.
I'm sure of that.
It does n't come so hea heavily loaded with advice against things.
Yes it's, it's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft wherever you can.
But erm but it's been a very bad thing for him.
But you see they've had computers in hospitals now for years.
and are, are employing and paying people to work them but they do n't ever seem to come to any let's say reportable conclusion about the cost of operations.
I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost, people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that.
Yes I suppose that's so.
I wish the government could really tellingly er do down these dreadful lies and scandal erm scaremongering things that the Labour opposition is putting forward.
I mean they do n't honestly care two hoots about people, if they can talk about the dreadful state the, the care of old people is in and all the rest of it and that it's going to get worse, frightening old people.
That's not caring for the community at all.
That's just erm politicking is n't it?
Oh!
Imagine how people like erm erm Helmut Kohl and.
Not Cook.
because he's in his own party, I mean Cook yes well he's a snidey little thing, I'm talking about the erm ambassadors and the politicians, the ministers who would be.
you know, opposing him.
They'd just, they'd just run over him absolutely, whilst he was grinning.
One ca n't see him in an ambassadorial role at all can one?
It may not come to it.
Oh it must be.
That's true.
They, they regard that as an excuse.
Have some more chutney, it was given to us by our German daughter-in-law.
So it will be perfect.
She did.
It was our Christmas present was n't it?
Mm.
Well has it been nice not having to go to France?
Mm I could n't tell how many people would agree with you about that one that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris.
Mm.
Shopping is much more comfortable now.
Mm.
There's a lovely suit in at the moment in the sale in what's that place called?
Near.
it's really lovely.
Smart, one could go to town or anywhere in it.
Well because it's darkish in colour and I'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now it'll be of a brighter colour.
Dearest I'm saying it's a dark colour.
Mm.
Shush, do n't.
push me, I do n't need pushing.
No no really I, I, I've resolved, it's charcoal grey you see.
Very smart.
My size too.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
I'll phone her and ask her if she's got it in red.
Mm?
Oh er is n't she oh is n't she super?
Which are they?
Oh no!
I have n't heard that one.
Oh but Maureen erm er what's she called?
Maureen Lipman, yes.
is very good on those is n't she?
She's the right sort.
Erm the thing that I feel I could n't go to see her in is erm Hello Joyce.
Mm.
Yes, I saw that bit and it was n't good.
because sh Joyce Grenfell was such a lady, it came through.
And and wh and er Maureen Lipman is much more earthy.
and that came through and it was no good.
If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you, you could n't.
Yes in a way, except she well you could do, it could be done.
Did you feel that about her on television?
Mm.
Completely.
Almost thought when she, when it was when it was erm er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it.
I almost thought ooh you know I'd love to write and say oh do n't, do n't.
Joyce Grenfell was such a lady.
You could n't say that to her cos she did n't it would be insulting but in fact, that's the big difference.
Oh yes they do.
Yes that's right, they do.
Oh does she?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm yes.
People who did things properly?
And was it one of his own?
Somebody had sent to him.
Mm.
Oh probably.
How funny.
Yes.
No?
No.
Oh how funny.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes it would n't go naked through the post would it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Which is useful.
Mm yes.
Yes I had n't thought about that.
Mm.
I know why, because you're not seventy.
Well they were probably erm invitation to a concert.
Mm.
Oh yes you ca n't, ca n't use them though.
Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know that it was a concert.
Mm mm.
And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send.
Of course, that's right.
That's right.
Well on a personal card you're not supposed to put dear anybody are you so.
that does make it difficult.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Without saying dear so and so.

Of course.
Are they called gentle.
cards?
safe distance cards.
indeed.
Oh gosh.
Have you used any of these erm things called Post It?
Th but they're useful?
Well er they're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody's benches.
erm but they've got a sticky bit on them.
and so you, you'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm and it comes off anything without making a mark on.
That's right, some teeny weeny ones?
Mm Folly gave them to you?
erm Patsy and more.
an another piece of ham, do.
Oh cheese.
Mm.
Right.
Please yourself.
You're trying to, you're trying to avoid being starved all the time are n't you darling?
It's difficult for you but he's trying to avoid being starved.
Will that plate do?
dish you out a larger one.
Okay.
Well help yourself, I can recommend cheese.
Mm.
Oh.
I hate it but I'll tell you why in a minute.
Go on.
As it would on the telephone, yes.
How right.
Mm.
I hate that programme because I like I tend to come and listen to the content of what they're saying.
and they're only saying it for the sake of keeping going.
And then er so it's never, it's never worth serious attention is it?

That's it, you see that's full of frustration.
for me.
Mornington Crescent?
I've heard that phrase used but I do n't know what it's for.
Oh.
Oh.
You have to come to it.
I, yes I see.
How extraordinary, I've not heard that one.
Mhm.
Oh you mean the programme where they do that?
Erm well that's not that's not My Music is it?
No.
Erm.
ca n't remember what it's called.
Oh.
I, I'm, I'm not with you on that one because erm I'm sure I'm vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is, I have heard of it I mean.
or heard it.
but I ca n't bring it to mind, it wo n't come to the front as it were.
Erm yes apart from My Music I ca n't think of one.
I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning.
came in half way through it, at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm Freud, Clement Freud.
talking and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week.
and how he'd seen prison and er they'd said they had n't any prisons but he found one and erm hospitals and all that sort of thing and at the end of the week's visit erm one of the very high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten the name of him, I think I'll just use that, thank you erm sent for h he, he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask and he said well perhaps there is one he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two, a few months ago.
and he also, he like me stayed in the and he named the hotel in.
Peking he said can you tell me why his room was larger than mine.
and his room had three windows erm and I, mine only had two.
he said in spite of the fact that I've been in parliament for longer than he has, which surprised me cos I would n't have thought so this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather.
and so Clement Freud said, not to him but now on this programme this morning, that's the first time I've ever been de-grandfathered.
That was rather nice was n't it?
Yes.
The Chinese did n't know.
I do n't think they have either.
I do n't think they'd have been impressed even if he'd told them.
No.
Mm!
Yes.
Well that's true.
Well that's right.
Other people go down with it.
You ca n't really I should think find a gene surely that's.
Mm there must be.
She was not nice.
Mm.
This reminds me.
might I just say this darling cos I've just remembered, I'll forget senile you see?
Erm we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series.
erm which a friend in London very kindly made for us because we were out with her, her mother.
and could n't see it.
and erm Joan's video has gone wrong in some way.
Yes, she does n't know how to work it to begin with but she.
was working.
she was working on that, of course we do n't know a thing about it, erm and the make, the erm the handyman chap came along and took a part away, it was faulty.
so we ca n't see it.
I was going, I'm getting round to that you see are n't I?
Erm we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us.
because it's now a fortnight since we had it I think.
May we do that?
But when, that's not going to disturb you?
Tomorrow morning?
No.
Afternoon.
Mm.
Well tomorrow, what happens to you tomorrow?
Is it your lazy day when you.

Okay.
We ca n't do it next Saturday because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese.
coming to spend Saturday.
So that's a dead day for next week.
And might be able to do it before the weekend perhaps.
Erm hoping Monday evening.
He's going to see Mr.
He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes.
erm and phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly.
erm because Mr was abroad and the girl said well I mean come in on Monday, when he'll be back.
and he may be able to see you then.
So come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can this is, this seems to have gone light.
We've got some ointment from the doctor which did n't work last time he put it out.
and seems to have worked this time.
So he said I ca n't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better.
So erm he did n't go.
but he got a phone call on the Tuesday from Mr's secretary to say oh Mr would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have erm it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came.
in case it has any bearing on any difficulty you might have in the future so he's to go down.
Mm Monday morning.
And then he's going to call at Sotherby's.
Do you know Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are.
With the exception of the one erm section leader that he deals with normally.
At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm the chap he normally deals with is away.
but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at and erm so he said well send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see.
send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all.
That I think was about Tuesday.
It never came.
This is what they do, they phone up asking.
Mm well we have n't got a fax.
But the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ.
I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby's are.
No not really, no.
And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
I suppose so.
Mm.
Does she work there?
Or some art gallery.
Mm.
So he is.
That's right.
So he is.
Mm I think they do cream it, yes.
Oh that's.
And then we'll arrange it with you, mm?

I am indeed.
Ooh er.
Oh.
Why would he need to do it in the dark?
Oh oh oh.
Oh yes.
Oh I see, yes.
Oh it is a wreck.
Yes it really is.
I think the vogue is dying is n't it?
Erm.
That was the sign from the beginning was n't it?
Ah.
Well he did n't, he did deserve it did n't he, really?
But he paid dearly for it in the first place did n't he?
I agree.
Well actually if he's.
If he's having problems.
you may be able to get that rectified may n't you?
And say yes.
Don.
Darling he's a very nice man.
Yes we've got a little bit of Israel have n't you?
Yes.
Hello Ian, oh I was hoping that you'd come and see us.
That's wonderful.
I'm just getting, will you tea?
Right I'll just get that.
Ian do you have milk in your tea?
Just.
yes right.
No sugar?
Oh good lad.
Well Ian and how are you doing?
Really?
You're keeping fit?
That's good.
How lovely.
Is he?
He's a handful is he?
Oh dear.
I'm just going to pour you a.
I w I was letting it.
er brew a little bit just to.
for you.
Oh that's kind of you.
Well we keep busy do n't we darling?
Ya.
And erm we just love it here of course.
so we've got nothing to grumble about at all really.
You are?
Oh are you?
That'll be nice.
Yes.
Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm?
Oh.
Oh dear.
Oh that's.
Good.
Yes.
Mm.
You're not?
No.
Well I mean these were the kind of jobs that were n't replaceable were n't they really?
In a slump.
That's right.
It was, it was somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it.
Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm Ian.
and no it is n't, no no no, not at all.
Now I'm going to leave those there.
and you'll just dive in to those wo n't you?
That's the thing.
I'm going to sit quite near to you because I can hear better when I do.
So.
Erm so this means that the house that you were so er happy with and have you continued to be happy with it?
Erm in er forgotten.
In Chiswick.
that's right.
Aha.
So you've got to leave that now?
Mm.
Well this is life when you're young.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's the only way to be really is n't it?
Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge?
Mm.
Mm.
Good.
Oh.
You, one gets very fond of a house really.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
My!
Oh.
yes.
Yes.
I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose.
to, yes.
And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something.
until he decides.
Mm yes, do help yourself Ian.
Erm so where would he be meaning to go if he does let you.
Yes.
Er no no.
Mm.
No.
No.
Indeed.
No that's very true.
That's true.
Mm.
Oh well let's hope that he will.
I mean the thing is at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period.
Mhm mm.
Yes.
I'm sure I'm sure it is.
I do n't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see.
Because we lived on the business, that was.
er a foregone conclusion and we never sought to move from there until he retired did we?
So one does n't know er exactly what it's like to do it.
Mm.
Gosh.
And tell us about the children, how old are they?
Mhm.
Oh I see, so they're nice spaces.
Yes.
Yes.
Ideal really.
Yes.
Yes.
That's nice.
Mm.
Exactly.
It sours the relationship a bit.
Yes aha.
Ah well I I is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin?
you've got two boys.
and so.
Oh the last of the tribe.
Well I think I think you know what I mean.
Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben was n't it?
He was five, number five.
Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now would n't it.
really?
Mm.
Mm well this is just how Ruth was.
This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys.
but erm and she thought I sha n't know how to deal with a girl at all.
which is a funny thing for a woman to think is n't it?
Does she?
It is odd is n't it?
But.
Oh, oh she adores her, and of course she said it's wonderful, I do n't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers.
This of course is passing now because the girl's.
four is n't she Noel?
Four and.
she'll be five in April and that's the youngest one.
And er, oh here they are.
and er she said it was lovely to be able to put her in dresses.
That's the first day at school.
for Catherine.
She, they all go to the same school.
That's nice is n't it?
Mm.
So Ruth I think as far as, barring accidents, will regard that as being her final.
They live in Wells.
in Somerset.
Mm.
And they no they're very happy there.
So that's them.
Yes John is doing well, he's got three children too.
Yes and his are.
the other way round.
erm a boy first and then two girls.
Nice kids.
Mm yes nice kids.
And of course Margaret's not erm inclined for marriage, she loves her job.
And erm I think she'll be she'll, she'll probably stay single unless.
she meets some nice old man.
She's now at erm one of the girls public day school trust schools in Sydenham.
Sydenham High School For Girls.
Her dream really is to be teaching at City of London School.
And erm I'm ho we're hoping that she might.
get a job there.
But she loves her work does n't she Noel?
And she.
Mm.
That's the bit that hangs on always.
is n't it?
Mm.
Yes I saw her, I went up to I went to keep fit with her.
and er.
although I did n't last Tuesday, I did the Tuesday before and she seemed.
to be getting back on her feet alright.
Ah.
Mm.
And what about Hamish?
Doing fine?
Oh yes.
I do n't think.
we saw him did we?
No.
No.
Oh, have they?
It's not a priority.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Have they?
Oh good.
Mhm.
Is he?
Mm.
Oh really?
Is n't that funny?
Yes, yes but, but lively.
Is that the only child they have at the present time?
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm.
And of course he'll be bilingual.
Mm.
Is it?
Mm.
Mm.
And how old is he did you say?
Oh well it's early.
It's such an advantage to them later on I think.
Mm.
Mm.
Is she?
Get three.
Trilingual.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes but in the end it does seem to work.
I was always a bit doubtful about it.
erm er you know, whether it could vu confuse children or not but in fact it does n't seem to with John's children does it?
They use.
Yes.
And they use both languages quite freely.
In fact she gets rather uptight because erm during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time.
which is very natural, and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives.
Aye.
That's right.
Well it is.
Will you have another one?
Well help yourself then if you want one.
Mm.
But.
of course the, the, the slump is also, not the slump, the recession is also er operative in Italy is it?
It's everywhere.
Ian why do people.
make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically?
Everybody's having to cope with it.
Of course.
They're bound to use it.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right of course.
They have, they will be drawing back on most things.
But in fact they're the people are n't they who need bilingual people on the staff?
Mm.
Is n't it extraordinary.
Mm.
They all seem to have more drive than our people, what's the matter with us?
Mm.
Yes.
That's right.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
You'd better get on with it and do it now.
But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school have n't you?
And once you've done it at school, it comes back with a bit of an effort quite quickly.
Yes.
Yes.
Did n't you?
Was it?
And what was the teaching system?
Er had they by the time you were still at school come on to that new erm er system where you speak a lot more?
No.
You've done it out of grammar books?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well actually the one thing you can say about it is, it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do.
because erm wherever you go now for refresher lessons, they will use the modern method.
And that's, that will build on that foundation.
You'll be astonished how quickly it'll come back.
You really will.
Mm.
That's true.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Well actually you're going to a centre are n't you er in where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity?
I think probably.
Mm I would imagine it's quite well led.
Ya.
And you'll have no problem, yes.
Aha.
Art?
Mm mm.
Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've got to do the French?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No I see.
Your work itself is going to take more time than that.
Is that just at first or is it regularly?
Mm.
Mm.
Ya.
It's tough really.
It is tough.
Yes, is it?
Yes.
Is it still advertising?
Yes.
You must be pretty good at that by now.
Yes you have.
It is n't?
Mm.
Mm.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh well, you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than.
unless you're forced to switch er horses, you know in, in mid stream.
Really?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
How funny.
But in fact you did get your O levels did n't you?
Yes I remember.
Mm.
Ah but wait a minute, not until after that was it?
He got his O levels but that was it.
Decided he'd had enough and I suppose you had too.
Did you stay on for As?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Well it's a it's a, in a way that's quite true.
Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you do n't need to does n't it?
Ah.
Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do a university you see in.
in er New Hampshire was n't it?
Erm.
That's right, you did.
You did.
Oh yes.
It would be wonderful would n't it?
He'd so love to see people and of course at the moment.
he dare n't make trips, or at least it would n't be wise to make trips yet.
because he's waiting for his.
Yes.
That's right.
We've got photographs, recent ones, to show you anyway.
And we saw him in September October did n't we?
End of September beginning of October.
and stayed.
they had a barn just a little way from the house, you could see it but it.
was n't very striking.
No it was, it was just grey and, and, and.
quite unobtrusive.
Well they've had a marvellous sort of conversion of that done.
for guests and erm.
Oh a beautiful house.
yes and they're still in the same house.
They they're.
very fond of it.
And erm so now when we go they're awfully sweet and they bring Edmund at the same time.
and we all three, Noel and Edmund and I, live in this barn.
Which is marvellous.
Yes.
It's lovely.
It's very lovely.
They're such nice people.
And of course they.
Oh did n't you?
Ellie.
Well it was summer, was n't it?
Oh.
And had they gone away then?
Dan.
Oh John.
Er John was the youngest.
Mike would n't be, I think he was w er getting on a bit, oh I do n't know.
Mike was at university.
Yes.
That's right.
That's right.
Yes.
That was John.
Mike was down at er Providence.
He was in university.
They're all married, those boys now.
Yes.
Dan is.
married.
Without any children.
oh yes Dan's a dear boy.
And er we're very fond of them all.
And erm of course er it's just like second home to Edmund.
They are so good to him.
Yes.
Oh he would if he had n't got them.
certainly.
I mean it's lovely because he er he adores to get into does Edmund and that means that he and George go about this lovely big er grounds that they've.
got and Edmund does lots of grass cutting and er.
all manner of things with.
George.
They've got a great com a great relationship going.
And of course he spends Christmas.
Erm.
he's older.
He's younger than John.
Are you thirty f.
four now?
That's right.
Well I should think Dan might be.
Not as much as that.
Well.
Yes.
Yes Dan must be I would have thought it's only months probably, but it might be quite a few months.
Mm I do n't think it's more because we soon had, started having our children did n't we?
Erm ooh wait a minute we're saying, we're saying than Edmund are n't we?
Of course, I'm stupid.
He was the eldest of their children.
Dan was.
Ya.
So I'm v I'm a bit vague about it, you may well be right and it's two years.
because of course we've got older children than Edmund.
No.
no, a couple of years you're quite right.
Couple of years older I should think.
Yeah.
That's it.
But erm oh they're a great family they really are but I think George and J Joy's having Edmund because although Dan lives in the town er what's it called, New Haven?
Erm obviously he's got his own business, he's got a shop now, an outfitter's shop.
Did he have it that time?
I know.
Oh he's an absolutely.
No.
That's er he worked in a shop probably at that time.
That's it, he worked in that er fancy goods shop.
Sorry?
Was it?
It does n't seem possible really does it?
Good heavens.
Was it really?
Was it?
Mm.
Oh well that was a great thing for you really was n't it?
You must have enjoyed it.
Was it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes he was a good travelling companion I should.
imagine.
Yes.
He of course is.
Well yes.
And do you sometimes get any word from him?
Mm well so do we.
Rarely.
Yes.
Have you got his latest address?
I'd better give it to you because he has.
changed it.
Oh righto I'll just, excuse me a minute I'm.
Oh I see.
Mm.
Ah it's pretty, yes it's that sort of place.
I have n't been to Hong Kong to see Ben.
because, but I did go to Hong Kong when I went to China.
That's right for three weeks and erm then I was n't impressed by it, I was much more interested in China.
But I would, in a way, love to go whilst he's there but he er he really feels that it would n't be a place that would suit pa and me on holiday.
So.
What love?
It is n't it is n't nice but for the young.
It's nice for the young I think.
Mm.
Now can you see Edmund's cos he changed.
You see it's a terrible erm.
Well it's here darling.
but it's just a question of finding it, it's.
Just go through, you'll find it certainly.
Is it.
that's it, is it?
That's it.
That's it, that's it.
Oh yes, yes he'll enjoy that.
No.
Who's going to sit down?
That's right sit there.
I'm gon na stand.
Are you happier standing?
That's alright.
Belinda if we can start with you more or less erm I heard the other day that you're half thinking that you might like to be a nurse?
Can you speak up a bit.
What erm what sort of nurse are you thinking about?
I can imagine you doing that.
Aha.
I can.
That would be wonderful!
I did n't.
know there was one at Saxted.
And is that for children who are living there or just go in for the day?
Oh Good!
And what qualifications mus must you have for that?
Mhm.
Good!
So probably GCSE.
That's a good idea!
You get a feeling for it then.
I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are do n't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Well that well tha wo would tha would you not think that's a good thing?
I mean, for instance, if you do the the very high grade Norlands nanny training they go on till they're grey and experienced it all.
have n't they?
Well, you know i do n't they?
Well.
would you feel you'd not want to do it all that time then Belinda?
Ca n't yet.
That's true.
Just a good experience for her for time, you know.
Indeed!
But I should n't want her do it all her life!
You would n't?
No.
It's a very well paid job!
Oh yes, I know!
What about that, but I meant she got ta think about, she'll want children of own and then she'll have chi.
Yes.
Are n't you?
Aye Liddy?
Oh yes!
But then.

do n't you think that it's a, it's a marvellous training for her?
That's what I say, it's a training, nice.
Yes.
training for them, then say after about three or four year if they wan na get married, they got children and they got some good experience.
Absolutely!
Mm.
It's invaluable.
Yes.
That ca n't be the kind of thing you're thinking of then?

What do you want, what do you have er, in mind?
Would you?
Good!
Well you're in the right place for that.
Would you got to an agricultural college?
It's a good place, Ockleigh.
Splendid!
And then, would you like to work in this area or would you like to go elsewhere?
Mm.
Mm.
And you wo n't have worked on a farm at all yet, will you?
Oh that's good!
Mm mm.
You think you'd quite like to be with animals would you?
Aha.
Yeah, what I mean, all round agricultural work and on your?
Is that it?
Well.
that's great!
I was looking at the garden as I came in, I thought I might have, even though I did n't know the number.
Yeah.
I'd have known that was your.
Yeah.
garden.
Because of all the trimmings.
No, they're not very good at all!
Well bearing in mind.
No.
It's.
Why's that?
the worst garden had for years!
It's a dry summer time.
Really!
Last summer time, I mean.
Ah yes!
last year I was cutting cauliflowers weighing nearly five and seven pound, but this year I sha n't have one weight two pound!
Is that because of the dry winter?
Yeah, dry is dry autumn too, you see.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
They did n't get a hold, did n't get a start.
Really?
Aha.
See an a, I would n't like other people keep using the water cos they very careful on using the water.
Yes.
but if I'd have give it, had to give them some water they'd have done much better but I, like everybody else we kept hoping it were gon na rain, but!
That's right.
Yeah.
And it never did at the right.
No.
time.
No.
No, I see.
No, I mean we have to tops this time of year, we ai n't got any in this year.
No er, cos they'd have dry up but I did n't put none in.
You'll.
But.
miss them.
Ooh well we have missed them!
No.
No one ate the did they?
Nor the cauliflow.
No.
Mm!
No, nope!
I mean the a normal week would go on a garden and get free vegetables every day off our garden could n't we, normal time, normal, every time?
Every day of the year!
Gosh!

Because.
there's nothing like them is there?
Oh there is n't, no no!
Aha.
Yeah.
Yes.
Do you like gardening too, Ben?

Laying in the kitchen.
Basketball's good.

You get nearer to the baskets.
That's right.
No.
No.
It is n't i, you've got to get the knack have n't.
you?
It's easier when you are tall.
That's true.
But you like tho, the idea of it do you?
Aha.
It's not so rough as some things, it's not so rough as rugby but perhaps you do n't mind being a bit rough do you?

They like it rough whe when they're young.
like that!
They do!
Yes.
They do, yes.
See more, do n't see no fear like we do when they're young.
No they do n't.

Really?
Yeah, well that's only he went up and down there.
They're lovely are n't they when they're li.
And she'd got.

Yeah.

She'd beat him in the kitchen!
I think cats can be lovely!
Oh yes.
Really?
And they'd pull the sprouts up.
Oh the, sprouts got you in the bath, went to and er kitchen to clean the sprouts, chuck them in a bowl I thought that's funny, I did n't chuck that one in there!
Course, I was looking out the window and I know he took I picked it out and it I looked again, there's another one in there, course she's only getting out the bath put them in a bowl like I was!
I ca n't believe my own eyes!
No!
And as soon as I went to get sprouts off a garden, she'd be on there, wo n't she, would?
She'd pull them off the stalks.
Really?
Yeah.
And just, she was playing ball in other words was n't she?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Yes.
Did she?

Oh how sweet!
Was she the one that was killed?
Yeah.
That's a shame is n't.
Mm.
it?
But, was it on this main road?
No, she was fine that one was.
Oh that's.
Ah, ah Whisky, so was that er, other one what we had.
Yes.
Really?
Milly, yes.
Milly.
Oh I see.
I see.
And was it on the main road that the one who was killed.
Yeah, we go had one killed a school teacher down here killed one of them.
When was that?
Ai n't erm about three weeks ago were n't it?
Another one killed on the main road as well.
It's heartbreaking!
We would love to have erm.
we'd love to have a cat but.
Yes, well er.
partly it's a tie if we're wanting to go out.
And i in a way it is.
But also it's er, it's it's too risky on that road.
It is too risky!
Ah, what a shame!
And when she come and knocked on the door she was upset more than we was cos she done it did n't.
Ah.
she?
yes.
Yes, well it is upsetting.
It's.
Mm.
upsetting.
to you to lose a cat is n't it?
Aha.
It's amazing, some cats will get an instinct.
Yeah, aye that's yeah, yeah.
wo n't they?
We had one that was very canny.
Mm.
about the road.
But we had one killed on the road too.
So she.
Yes,.
Honestly, that's tremendous!
That's terribly funny!
That really is.
Was she?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
used to run and.
anywhere.
Really?
Yes.
Oh he and coming up that passage, run and jump right up on me by getting up my shirt.
Yeah that's it!
Yes!
A good place to be!
I I like cats better than dogs because.
Yes.
I think dogs want a fuss made of them, cats do n't really.
No, no no.
The, there's a way of.
they do n't like, they do n't like.
a lot of fuss.
They're much more independent.

Feeling the fire.
Yes!
Let's see how you've been getting on.
Do you get at school any erm any sort of music lessons?
Good!
They make a terrible noise do n't they?
Is it erm, is a snare the thing that co, the sort of wire that goes across it?
And what does that do?
Oh I see.
Ah yes.
Are you in the choir?
You've only been there I think a ba, a term have n't you?
So tha, yes.
Mhm.
Good!
Yes.
It needs practice does n't it?
Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice reading music because you just have one line to follow.
and that's a good start is n't it?
Aha.
Yes.
Nice!
Good!
I think it's a good school do n't you?
Yes.
Mm!
Oh!
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
That's good!
Mhm.
Yes.
Yes.
And then they're just not available to play at home th those.
times.
No, that's right.
You always find wherever you are that the people who've been there a long time get sort of erm a bit uppity, they think that they're.
the bosses of everything.
But of course, one of these days you'll be at the top of the school wo n't.
you!
Yes.
That's not very nice when you're a bit smaller than they are.
Aha.
Yes.
Yes.
Well when you're big, that's the thing to remember and you wo n't push.
the little ones around perhaps.
will you?
Mm.
Mm.
Oh of course, yes!
So you know what it's like being small.
too.
And what about all this gardening then?
I was very interested when you were talking about gardening this morning.
Erm.
you do n't do any gardening, I suppose at school?
Mm mm.
Mm.
But still, you do n't need a a garden at school, you've got the, really the whole of that garden at home.
Because your father ca n't do much now can he?
Yes.
Ah ha ha!
Yes.
Yes.
I suppose so!
And really and truly you've got to have a very big piece of ground to need one of those have n't you?
I think you're a very good forker and spader really!

Mhm.
Where was that er.
Ben?
Oh I see.
Ah yes.
Yes.
No, and of course the weeds will have a.
a fine old time wo n't they?
Aha.
But your ground, I imagine you've kept it fairly cre, free of weeds for quite a.
time now?
No.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
I see.
Because, in fact, you ca n't put that compost on the, or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables?
Yes.
Erm, you ca n't put that on till it's really broken down can you?
So it's erm you use up probably quite quickly what you've got.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, yes.
Yes, it seems reasonable does n't it, to put it all back?
It's all been natural stuff has n't it?
Aha.
Which bit of the gardening do you like best?
Yes.
You get yo wo once you've done a lot you suddenly.
feel it do n't you?
But the hoeing is nice and easy.
more or less.
Mm.
Mm.
Nice!
It's got, oh really, that's the handle is it, that does.
that?
Ho.
We've got a hoe that what is that hoe called, that we've got Noel?
It's got these prongs that go like that.
Have you got one of them?
Because they get, the weeds out quite deeply do n't they?
Mm!
Nice!
Mhm.
Yes.
Has he?
Do you?
Yes th, there's something nice about the old tools is n't there?
Yes.
Ooh did you?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh yes, it's interesting!
Aha.
Chicken hoppers?
Oh yes.
Really?
Oh, do they?
Oh that's not nice is it?
Yes, that's because they've got a light on them is n't it?
Yes some erm some light, electric light fittings are made of plastic and they like bad fish after.
a time do n't they?
It's horrid!
Yes, nasty!
Mhm.
Yes.
I in the end it gets yuck!
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
That's an advantage?
Ah!
Oh dear!
Yes.
Oh dear!
He brought the wrong ones he thought!
Oh that's.
hard-liners is n't it?
And where do you keep all this stuff?
You have n't got a shed have you, in the back?
Oh yes, Anderson shelter!
Mm.
Oh!
Oh that's nice!
Yes.
To keep them out of the weather.
You've just got to have somewhere to put them have n't you?
Aha.
Yes.
Now that's quite true.
Well you're quite an experienced gardener, it seems to me Ben!
You must of learned a lot from your father by now?
Oh yes, that's useful!
Mhm.
Yes.
Mhm.
That's right, a family thing, you hand it down from generation to generation.
do n't you?
And the books of, are useful because there are lots of new ideas have come up.
as you go along.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mm mm.
Yes.
Carrots?
Yes, some of them are nearly round.
they're so small!
Are n't they?
Tha look, they look funny to me!
Aha.
No.
That's right they, and they must be a bit fiddly to peel must n't they?
To scrape, rather.
Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round corners have n't you?
Ugh, yes, yes!
Ha!
What's the idea of those little carrots?
Yes.
Did you like the taste of them?
Are they?
Mm.
No.
Well there's so many things that get into carrots are n't there?
There's a wa, a wire worm or something?
And carrot fly.
Is carrot fly the thing that goes for carrots or not?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yes!
Mm.
Yes.
I'm sure.
The plants.
Yes.
Yes.
That's why I say nature works against you instead of with you.
So I do n't bother!
Yes, soot is supposed to be good for something.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
No.
You'll have to get some more soot.
You'll have to get him along and you can have some more soot.
I've forgotten what they used to use so soot especially.
My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was.
Does it?
They do n't like it?
No.
No.
Aha.
There are so many things you've got to be looking out for in those.
That's right.
Yes.
Let's see what we've got there.
Ben would like to go to Otley to do a proper.
training course.
Yes.
Yes.
And so you're going to work at the things that will get you in there are n't you?
Mm.
You learn about soil formations and that sort.
of thing.
Yes.
Sorry?
Mhm.
Mm.
He's a wonderful gardener for twelve, I can tell you!
Ha ha.
And what else would help you to get into Otley?
I suppose you've got to be able to do maths for most things have n't you?
Yes for.
measuring an an yes.
Really?
Well I think that you wear masks now do n't you, when you use it?
I see.
No?
Well it would, not very good for you would it really, because of your.
chest?
Yes.
Aha.
Mm.
What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting is your experience from your early days in horse shoeing has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving erm if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that.
Mm.
Yes.
It's, and that's your hobby is n't it?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
And is it.
different type of horse that makes it different for shodding.
today?
Not the question of the same horses doing a different job.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm!
They were.
built for strength.
for the.
jobs.
Were they?
That's right.
Would they?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh yes!
G A I T.
Yes.
Really?
Good heavens!
Really!
What is it?
Forging?
Now, is it related to forging ahead in any way?
Oh do, is that where forging ahead comes.
from?
When you're really pushing?
Yes.
Yes.
Good Lord!
Oh!
It's amazing!
Mm.
Really?
Right.
Yes.
No.
Ah that's it!
Yes.
Ooh!
Ooh yes!
Like us banging our ankles like that.
Ooh!
Ooh yes!
I can imagine!
Yes.
But the knee comes sort of out.
does n't it?
Er inside.
there's a.
nobble.
on the, yes.
Really?
You'd never dream!
And so people who go and, usually into horses need to know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the horse.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Course!
Mhm.
Yes.
Full time job!
Mm.
Would be.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
And you think of these, for instance Prince.
Phillip, who is.
presumably those horses do n't do long spells of that sort.
of driving?
They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they?
On the stage coaches, yes.
Yes.
Just as we do, walking a bit less.
carefully.
Mm!
Mm!
What about er, in those days er, possibly a few still, when erm let's, you said gypsies did n't you?
or let's say just erm odd tradesmen had a horse or a pony or whatever it was pulling a cart round the streets with vegetables or with, with er coal.
or something what about the amount of care they would get from a farrier, those horses?
That's the thing I suppose, yes.
I would n't be surprised about that!
Living in the East.
End, I would n't be surprised.
at that!
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
Course!
Yes.
That's right.
Necessity being a good driver.
Ooh!
Really!
As tight as that?
I suppose, now would, could that possibly be called a false economy?
What was he using up.
time?
Yes.
I was going to say, time.
did n't count in the same.
No.
Mm.
No.
That's right.
That's right.
No.
No.
That's right.
By the result you.
would see that you had to work a bit.
harder and.
No.
No.
Aha.
Yes.
That's right.
That's it.
Time costing as much.
as it now does.
Really?
One turned the other way on top.
of the other?
Yes.
Oh!
Golly yes!
Yes.
Oh I see.
You did n't use.
that as a shoe you then.
made it an a new.
piece of metal?
Mm.
That's right.
yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you?
Because they were made of the right kind of iron?
Yes.
Really?
Wired?
Really?
Yes, course.
Is n't it tragic to think how far from that we've moved?
And it's so wasteful u.
Yes.
It hurts us.
who've known.
the other thing does n't it?
Mm.
Yes.
That was ready for next time and you've saved.
that time.
Yes.
That's right.
Yes.
Yes, because of course you had all the equipment to shape it up anew.
did n't you?
You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it I should.
imagine.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
a a curved scy a sickle type.
shaped thing.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
And you just call that a hook?
So you di, did you call the thing you were doing hooking or not?
Wi with hook, would you say.
that you were hooking.
the hedge or not?
You're hedging.
Yes, I see.
Yes.
The tool was a separate name?
Really?
Aha.
And did you have to repair things, well you probably did, er farm instruments, I do n't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what.
have you?
Yes.
Mhm.
Ha!
Now how do you spell that, S P A D.
G E.
Oh just a s.
Sped?
Spud.
Really?
Oh not erm, not a spadge Yo er.
I heard the name spadge when I was.
Really?
Yes.
I'm rather.
learn a foreign language.
is n't it?
What, what was that?

Oh!

I see!
Yes.
That's right.
Really?
Now could that be.
the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one of the men in the village, using it to pull out a lot of weed from undergrowth, really.
it's er, i and it's got three prongs like that, and there's, I think, an arrowhead shape on each prong.
Yes, that would be.
the modern.
adaptation.
Yes.
Yes.
It is.
erm, for getting up a lot.
of weed?
What about.
Mhm.
Ah yes!
Oh!
Did they?
Yes.
And was a lot of straw in with that?
Ah!
Because otherwise you could n't have pulled.
er, sort of muck without.
straw could you?
But straw.
of course.
I see.
Yes.
Mhm.
Yes.
Even to spell it.
in the first place.
you needed.
to know.
Mm.
No.
no.
They are, that's true.
That's right, I see.
Yes.
It was phonetic spelling!
Croom.
Yes.
And very often the O, in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh does n't it?
Yes.
Home.
Mm.
I suppose a lot.
of dialect is.
Yes.
Yes you do.
But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now, for instance, Lancashire i it's.
not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy you.
know up the city.
that sort of thing.
Nothing like over.
here.
dialect.
Yes.
It is!
That's right.
Yes.
Indeed!
Yes.
Exactly!
That's true, is n't it?
Yes.
Well I hope.
it will universally because.
I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their.
speech and.
their traditions!
You never hear on the whole the Englishman saying but I'm English!
Do you?
But they.
Yes!
That's right.
But when you te.
Absolutely!
That's very true!
It's also true that up in.
Scotland they do n't like to hear English accents on their television and news.
They much prefer to have their own people.
But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent?
And every time a trade unionist comes on.
I'm afraid.
we've got a little phrase, another.
bloody Scot we say!
And then you've got them.
with the roughest of the.
the trade.
unionists!
pretty well Scot.
So we've been perhaps a little.
bit erm reticent.
about our dialects.
Well er, you ca n't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and.
for a long time I have been.
and you never say anything that I do n't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome.
Yes.
Mm.
Exactly!
No!
You do n't.
Yes.
No.
Was he?
Oh yes!
No, they do n't.
They do.
Yes.
Wonderful!
That's an achievement!
You know one thing that's striking me at this moment actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you.
met er, Hector and you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there.
Erm, in these days when er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down.
erm it seems to me that the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands.
if you like.
er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also combine with.
Hector's work.
erm.
Oh, I think that's a a tremendous.
strength to a marriage!
I feel the same with Noel.
if there's something really interesting that you have.
between the two.
of you.
erm, you do n't give up at the first little hurdle.
Does n't it?
I feel that.
Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage.
It really does!
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Is n't that wonderful!
I yes, I really believe in that.
feeling!
A sense of belonging.
I belong here.
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Marvellous!
I think if one's receptive to things like that.
you know, it si, it.
it strikes you.
does n't it?
And er.
And you do n't forget it because.
you're young enough to be so impressed by it.
Yes.
That's wonderful!
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That was wonderful.
was n't it?
All coming to it.
Yes.
I can quite see that really.
Because.
that was a whole thing was n't it?
Connection with the.
city.
Er.
the ancientness of the.
actual.
thing.
you were copying.
Absolutely!
Absolutely!
And now, of.
course, it sits.
America with.
its sword in it.
on certain occasions.
It's a it's a permanent tribute to your.
collaboration.
forever in America.
Yes.
It's wonderful!
