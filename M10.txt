Oh, I thought you said not young!

Did he?
I'm used to taking like his lips are sticking to the window!

Did you see that programme last night?
B B C two about the stolen cars.
Oh!
Bloody hell, the things they get up to!
You know if you buy a car that's been, like it's been pinched or something like that?
Yeah, buy it in innocence and if it's been robbed the police confiscate off you you get a piece of paper saying that they've got it, and that's it you've you've got nothing!
And the insurers.
do n't have anything to do with it!
Yeah.
Mm.
But er.
they were on about that they ship them abroad and th, they were interviewing a lad in London he said oh, he used to get up in the morning and er go down to the phone box and phone this contact they know and he'd tell you what cars you wanted pinching this day and they pinch them to order!
Oh yeah how many would you say you'd pinched in year?
He said, well, he said there was two of us he said working together and er, I'd be look out for my mate or he'd be look out for me, he says erm ooh, between five and six hundred a year, he said they pinch!
I said and they.
Yeah.
What.
said, you know how, how did you get into them?
He said, well let's put it this way he said I can get into a Ford and start it without breaking any windows.
yeah quicker than I can with a key!
He did n't say what he did.
but he said, a Ford he said, I can break into a Ford without breaking any windows and start the ignition.
quicker than anybody with a key!
But he was a a reformed now he was helping other people ge get away from pinching cars like in a they have like.
you know, rehabilitation centres they.
He said, what we used to do he said.
Oh aye!

and they said er.
He was n't old was he?
Twenty four, twenty five.
Sometimes, he said we used to take them motorway he said to junction whatever at Dover and they'd be somebody waiting there with the money give us the car we'd go back to London and they'd just take it up the.
Ah!
Yeah.
Up there?
Aye.
Yeah it's all organised, it's not like like the gypo's will be doing like this.
this is all organised bloody down to!
They did.
They'd have made a fortune!
Not without them garages!
Doing it make a make a fortune doing it.
legally.
He said they're doing this as well.
like you got your your chassis number and engine number and everything like that.
and you've a number inside the car as well on the bottom of the car on the floor so er some of them no, they do n't so some of them take the mickey of them and putting different plates on of a written off car from a scrap yard so you can have like a brand new Sierra smashed up in a scrap yard and you buy it for like a thousand pound and you this Sierra with a brand new Sierra, so you change all the plates over and do all this on the car and then you got a bloody Sierra worth about nine or ten thousand pound.
brand new!
And you've paid a thousand pound for it, so he's making all this profit all the time!
And the the police were just showing, you know.
the ways that they do it sort of thing.
Some of them.
just get the plate and er like stick it over with a bit of er filler or something like that and stick it over the top!
And, people are none the wiser they, if they can see it.
they go aye, that's alright, but the only way you can tell you'd feel a jagged edge where they put this plate.
Or some of them they cut the whole floor out and weld a new take the floor old car and weld it back in again.
He said, and the police said.
as quick as we find a way, to catch them they think of something else.
they bloody do it all the time!
Yeah.
Fell apart in Manchester.
There was one in Manchester was n't there?
The Renault five turbo going down the road and had a crash and it split in two did n't it?
And they all bloody died!
And er said about it's a regular and er they're doing it proper, they're putting them on jigs so they're welding them and they're out of line and all sorts!
And they were interviewing this feller, he said, oh we went for a day out he said and I'd just bought this car and I was really made up with it he said.
Oh no!
He paid two and a thousand for this car, whatever it was!
I was real made up!
And he's travelling along the road and the next thing there's such a bang and it would n't go any further!
Bloody!
So he got out and he looked underneath and the drive shaft had fell off so he got it towed back to the garage wherever this garage was and they had a look at it and all the head were loose you could waggle them about!
And then he thought, this is queer so he picked the bonnet took the bonnet up like that and all the bloody front of the car had come loose and all all the welding.
had co come loose!
Bloody amazing it was!
So he said, you know you ca n't claim anything off the insurers or anything, so that's all his money.
straight up the bloody road!
And er the police, that was in Kent somewhere, the police were n't it?
Cos only so many police forces have got a certain group of men on the you know, sorting all the cars out and you can take your car there.
er.
you've just bought a car or you've got a car you can take it and the police look over it to see if it's alright.
If it's been re-registered sort of thing, so there's a big line in cars all.
And the police engineers go round with his mate and he's looking at the engine numbers and the chassis numbers and all those bloody numbers inside the car and he's looking like and er the interviewer said oh and this woman's in for a shock!
She's gon na find out that the car is stolen!
So she comes back and she had an Orion erm she sa, she said er oh well erm I got some bad news for you, said er your Orion's two cars been welded together!
Oh no, she said you're kidding are n't you?
No, no, it's right I said erm the back end is such and such a registration Ford Orion but the front end's off a Ford Escort!
And you know she'd but.
She'd lose the bloody car then, she'd lost everything!
Bloody hot it were!
Oh it, it was smart it was nice!
No they have n't, they'd been bought a car that had been like, that it sort of been written off and rebuilt or something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The D V L C, if you have a written off.
they'll re-register it as long as you can prove the year of the car, they register it.
as that year.
But, the registrations if they ca n't prove it properly.
you get a Q plate on it questionable registration.
So the D V L C do n't look into it too deep they just send.
an engineer have a look round, oh it looks alright.

And then there was an inspector from the.
Mm.
Oh no!
Yeah.
So you'd have been running?
Oh aye!
Yeah.

Pint of Stella please?

Once I get in from work, I'm knackered!
If it had been a summer night.

Well.
That was.
just a bad thing to do innit?
No, he's a bit rough!
Cos he!
Oh aye!
Well, no you can, aye!
Yeah!
Oh, you can buy a cheap ones with a just a tape on without the.
and record player.
Ooh aye, what them bloody cars.
they were in er.

the Spanish police and er.
insurance investigators in Britain.
pa.
is a like.
on the main road.
and anything with a foreign number plate they were.
pulling over.
especially the British ones.
and erm.
They were just stopping.
them and just.
taking the details.
chassis numbers and engine numbers and everything.
and er.
insurance etcetera and i, investigator whatever he was!
And he's calling the D V L C in Swansea.
they normally just.
and this woman was in her.
a little O Opel.
whatever it was.
Little maroon Opel, B registration.
So I took all the.
the particulars, he'd get on his mobile phone.
and erm.
oh it was er.
whatever it is, oh yes that's er.
He goes back and he says I've got some very bad news for you.
Oh!
well, this Opel is n't an Opel!
Well what is it?
It's a Vauxhall Nova.
You're kidding?
No er.
it's a silver Vauxhall Nova.
they bloody changed it all about so that the, O, little Opel, was a Vauxhall Nova!
Erm, so what happens now?
Oh erm.
the police are typing.
a thing up they'll have to confiscate the car!
Been.
stolen!
And they had that and a.
Toyota Celica, black.
No, she was living out there.

House out there.
So it's.

just full of bloody cars that had been confiscated!
There's was thousands of cars, cars that were stuck in there.
Some little cars there was Range Rovers.
everything!
They did n't say, they did n't go into it.
Aye.
Yeah.
They ca n't claim money for these.
That woman I said about that had the.
she was in an Orion but the front end of it was a Escort.
the escort that it be.
it belonged to the i, the numbers.
So the chassis number engine number for this Escort.
and they.
chased the feller and he phoned him up and he said ooh my.
car's still parked on the drive outside!
So they were investigating him then!
Cos his car was still in the drive outside.
Well bloody.
But they do it the other way as well.
It.
He pinched a car in Italy this is a Ferrari.
Testarossa.
it was worth.
hundred thousand pound in Britain.
it was.
it had been shaped.
And they paid.
it was on a car park at Heathrow Airport.
and it had all the paperwork with it, it was gon na be shipped to Singapore.
Well the same car in Singapore was worth two hundred thousand pound.
cos there's such a long waiting list, tha that's the value of it out there.
so they they pinched it and got a buyer out there!
and they caught him, you know, mid-way type of thing.
So th.

Yeah.
Do you wan na lager bitter.

You know there might ha, there might have been three hundred ya, three hundred yards of houses semis and detached and they had a bit of land, but all the back of that, that was theirs!
You know, it was all fenced they had n't lived there long had they?
And it was all new fences and it had all been it had been.
No it was old.
It was n't at first,.
Aye, but in that lounge, when I when I went that lounge it was, they were the sort of people that bloody do n't open the curtains!
They'll save the blo, I presume save the bloody sun you know, fading the carpet or the curtains.
Cos the carpet must have been worth a bloody fortune anyway!
All the furniture in there was all you know, really smart stuff!
Well I suppose it was antique, it was awful!

hard wood, oh it was really smelly!
And it had a they had a stuffed fox.

seriously though, you ca you could n't see where it had been shot.
I had a look round it, oh it's this.
he was there really!
Oh.
like a little rigid bloody board thing!
Oh this was really nice, it was only.
a young fox.
Oh it was really nice!
And they had another one.
that was er it had been done.
all like oh like, twenty years ago.
and the difference it was.
the new one, it was like.
it was there it was.
looked nice, but the other one it was all snarled and everything!
The person who'd done the old one.
in my eyes like, was more professional than the one that had done the new one!
Cos it was all all this.

It was all smell and I do n't know what it was!
To look at you could just imagine that, you know, going for something looking like that.

Pure white like that.
Comes.

Lovely he is.
No it's a different one.

He's alright, he was rolling over on the floor yesterday with me was n't he?
Well I was n't rolling on the floor, the cat was.
Mhm.

Has n't he?

Ooh that's a shame that you missed her, bloody hell.
Ooh you'd have never got down the road.
Aunty Beryl.
When was the last time you seen her?
Was it?
She must be.
Lost her bloody voice again perhaps.
Well if you rung you could always say oh I'll have to go cos somebody at the door if she starts going on a bit long.
Say ooh there's somebody at the door, have to go.
That's the best.
Well of course you can.
Well if you did n't ring tonight and rung tomorrow and rung early on-ish and you'll have to say.
ooh our Michael, ooh, ooh there's somebody at the door, I'll have to go.
Yeah.
And you could have ten minutes on the phone and say ooh I'll have to go, there's somebody at the door.
And then that's it then innit?
The ball's in her court then.
Ah.
Yeah.
They're coming at Easter.
Yeah.
Mm.
Did you watch Beadle before?
Oh.
Neighbours and Coronation Street.
Mm.
Have they?
There were a lot of crows when we went for a walk before flying round.
Aye.
Mm.
Looking for turds.
No.
I went to the tip yesterday.
to the skips and in a fortnight they shut.
They're shutting the skips down and then anything that you take then you have to take straight to the tip.
And they're gon na charge you for going there even if you've got like household stuff in the car, they're gon na charge you for tipping.
I said to the bloke I'll not bloody pay.
He said well I've lost me job through it he said.
Cos he looks after the s the skips.
and then he can have what they have to put price in and then they, they have the scrap out of them see and all the rest of it.
So I've lost me bloody job because of it he said.
And the nearest place to go to a skip then is in Queensferry.
And if you just tip it outside the gates they're gon na fine you two thousand pound.
Well he reckons they're gon na have like security there and everything.
Spencers.,.
Nowt.
Yeah.
Where?
Spencers?
Mm.
I said I'll leave mine out for the bloody bin men before I take it down the tippy.
I'd put bags of bloody bricks on the front.
And I'd leave the buggers there as well.
If he did n't take them they could stop there.
He said it's bec all because the tipping's been privatized or something.
Well they reckon they've, they've split it all ready for privatizing.
Because there's like post office parcels now is n't there?
And.
the post office counters.
Like the post office down the road.
And the post office letters and all the bloody rest of it, it's all been split up ready so they just privatize it.
Not poll tax, bloody tolls.
Did you watch the football this afternoon or that.
kung fu.
Did you, did n't see kung fu no?
And the Antiques Roadshow.
Aye.
I did n't see that.
It wo n't go any tighter, you'll have to put more paper in it if you wan na.
Well just leave it like that and let it stretch so the leather stays like that.
That's where she had the bloody potato at the back of the bloody thing, there, pushing it in.
It has stretched it has n't it?
You'll pull the bloody leather from under there if you tighten it any more.
You see it wo n't tighten any more, that's it.
Well it just winds up and it pushes a wedge forward and splays them out.
Well it's for like a a narrower shoe, a woman's shoe,.
pack it out.
About the wedding?

Eh?
I dunno.
Oh he's staining them.
He should have left the bloody things off because they're gon na have to take them off if they have their carpets down and might have to have something planed off them or something might n't they?
Mm it looks well now.
But he was having today as well were n't he, his back door?
He was having his back door put on today were n't he?
Well he had an old one on, he bought a new one on Friday.
Oh it looks well there now.
Mm.
Mm.
Well he's had the fire plumbed in but the gas is n't on.
I d well that's what he was gon na do, that's what Les was gon na do, put the fire in.
It's only a matter of connecting the bloody pipe up.
He's had an electric bill has n't he for god knows how much.
And he has n't bloody used any.
Mm something like that, or eighty pound was it?
I said what you gon na do?
I said you wan na send the bugger back, he said do n't worry I have done.
Well that's the one, he's had one.
Aye ours will be, if you have yours in the morning ours will be here tomorrow or Tuesday.
I expect.
Should n't be that much.
Did you see that Stars in Their Eyes last night?
That Lesley Crowther with them people singing.
That young girl was good were n't she?
Mm.
Aye.
But she s Marty's got a tape of the woman that actually sung that anyroad who she bloody sounds like her.
She was good.
Yes.
Dopey little bugger that one eh?
Horrible little bugger.
shed will be nice and dry now, there'll be no water leaking in.
I'll have to get some wood preserver or creosote and.
I'll do all the fences before.
Well it's too bloody late now, all the rain will have stopped by I finish messing about I expect.
It's made the difference though putting that other stuff on it.
I did it with some stuff before.
and er I was watching it when it was raining the other day, you could see the rain dripping off the wood rather than soaking into it so it's done something.
Oh everything's been in the bloody thing anyway.
Everything's in there anyway.
No.
I'm gon na get all the back tidy for the summer.
I know it's not very big but.
if I get it tidy, put a bit of do all, get all the garden level and everything.
Be able to, at least be able to sit out or something in the summer.
And I'll put so bit more soil in that, you know that border thing that we've got there?
Well there was all concrete and all sorts on the top of that were n't there?
So I've knocked it all up so I'm gon na dig it over and put, get some more soil this next week.
Well I do n't know.
I do n't wan na pay for the bugger.
I'll see Johnny, see if he's got anything.
Mm.
Well I'll leave ca I do n't wan na do them till the summer, it will be too bloody wet now.
It's wet as down there.
Went down for a walk today did n't we?
It was slippery as hell down the fields.
Mm.
Mm.

We'll get it developed and we've.
we've got things on him as well so we find the best.
Yeah he was comical was n't he, tonight?
He had his bloody he had his cushion and he had his bloody, you know that one how we got him with his head on his cushion like that?
He was lying with his head on his cushion, eh.
god almighty.
Do they?
Oh aye.
Well I suppose they'll, you send them all in then there's eight semi finalists.
and then they'll just pick one out of that to go on as part of the calendar.
For one of the months, I would have thought.
The way, that's the way I read it anyway.
Mm.
I would have thought so.
I think that's what it'll be myself.
I mean if you sent that one in with his head on his cushion er erm I do n't suppose there'll be anybody else is gon na send one in like that.
People's gon na be sending them in with with the dog.
standing there or doing.
whatever.
But that one it, they might say oh you know, bloody hell that's.
good you know.
That'd be nice to have on the calendar sort of thing.
I know we, you have n't got a cat in bloody hell's chance of us going but.
Oh no.
Aye.
Yeah.

I said, I said have you invited Aunty Joan and them?
He said oh I've invited Aunty Joan but nobody else cos I did n't fancy any of the others.
Yeah.
But he has n't invited any to the night.
I think I might have his conscience by saying that I do n't mind.
I know but an extra four people's not gon na cost that much more is it?
You little sod.

Why I asked him is because he had a wedding invitation for Rob and Jen.
