I prefer tablecloths to.
Yeah cos we ordered when it was.
About an hour later it arrived but we were standing at the bar when we had er ordered it.

And eventually they told us to go upstairs and sit down at the table.
So we did and eventually.
It was quite nice actually.
Yes it was.
Yes it was very tasty.
but rather expensive.
This was n't the hotel, the hotel was very posh yes.
Presumably felt they could n't afford.

Apparently he's a director of various canal preservation bodies and things.
Yeah.
Yeah he is.

She was okay this week.
Well, she's a totally snowed under.
with work.
Like I had to give her some top priorities yesterday as she was n't going to be about.
Actually she did very well on one of those.
She did far better.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Well I made sure my boss told her, that's.
Cos he was desperate for cos he needed an answer for Monday morning for Dave.
Dave's erm wife produced a baby last week.

Well you're not to.
I'm not quite sure what happens you see.
That's why.
hear the sound of the video.
Well I can hear it now.
Yeah I'm wondering whether it's playing to itself, with the television off.
Do you think that's likely?
Or does it not do it?
Would it?
No.
It's just that I can actually hear it.
I can actually hear the motor on.
on turning round.
I presume what happens when it's not on it's all geared up ready to.
Where are you going to?
Right.
Yes.
What was that?
Ah but that was n't on before was it?
Cos mummy only just come down for breakfast.
But it's true, it does make a noise.
There's lots of noises, lots of electrical things.
Oh was it vibrating?

You've been having some of that, yeah.
Yeah.
The trouble is this has erm crusts, sort of rind on it, that's all.

Is that alright?
Right.

That's why I like Saturday's and.
Do the garden or walking or whatever it is.
Something very different.

What is it?
You're right.
It is oranges.
They've been sitting there for over a week.

Oh.
Sorry for that.
That's right.
Half each.

Too big.

If you peel one I'll peel the other.
Am I a friend too?
That's nice is n't it? friends.
Well I'll do one and mummy does the other one.
And you can share it up.
Yes.
very difficult to peel.
One day I had them and they were full of pips.
Did you have that problem?
Mm.
Have you.
With lots of pips in?
Mm.
Mm.
Sorry about that.
You just could n't tell from the outside.
I had that problem once.
So I do n't know whether this one will have pips in it, so be careful.
Oh they usually do.
They were quite big.
Did you?
Sorry.
Yeah.
You're checking yours are you?
Slow down a bit.
Yes.
Chew them properly.
Yes.
Mm.
No I'm not suck it I just eat it.
Oh I see, they do n't peel it.
They're nice are n't they?
Very nice.
It's nicer than a satsuma really.
I'll have a look and see what else there is.
Yeah I think daddy's just erm making sure we have n't got such sticky fingers after our oranges I think.
Then we'll have a biscuit.
Yes?

Well there might be.
But I can understand.

Fair on who?

Will she have watched Inspector Morse?
She wo n't of watched it, cos it's bound to be on a Wednesday night!
Does she like Inspector Morse?
No, she probably does n't like it.
A bit spicy!
It was I remember reading in the paper that it's been it's been filmed at a house which no one's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions, it was not Bradley Hall.
And even people who write about.
Well that's fine.
It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire you know?
It's as you come off the.
and.
They somehow managed to persuade the owners, apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings, even they had been refused access!
Somewhere in Oxfordshire.
I think it was about last week's epi, but they seem to e imply that it was last week's episode that would.
do it.
Alright.
Well that's the only chance.
Mm.
Cos yo.
And?
She is a bit but it's.
I think that's the thing.

Different when you're not well you feel tired.
You're not saying you are cold and then you're saying you're not cold!
Are you shivering?

Okay.

I could n't find ca n't find any books on.

Well, they were n't!
Cos I've had a look at those pile, they did n't include them.
He was listing I should read a story on, mother feeding the five thousand.
or something like that.
But these are.
the only ones that I've found well they were, that was all.
Does that matter?
I mean I'll bring them back again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
I do n't need to do all of this from an actual point.
of view.
So, this is all food that is.
Take.
Whoops!

Doing the bus conductor, do you remember the bus driver, the bus conductor?
He was very happy was n't he?
Kept on smiling and.
Yes.

Do you think he'll be well enough to go to school?
So for tea Tim is Christopher's having.
Bread, toast?
What do you reckon to that then mummy?
Half a bit.
I dunno, I think I'll resign if that's the case!
Or for you, resign from Church Council.
and resign from being a daddy!
No.
No.
Resign hand in my notice.
Did you hear something?
So what would you like to eat darling, cos you do n't like hot cross buns?
Bread?
Not this.
I do n't mind.
Hello.
How are we?
Still all in the land of the living.
Have you had a quiet day today?
He looks very quiet at the moment.
Hello hello hello.
Hello.
Hello hello hello.
Are we here?
Are we living?
Is it?
Did you?

Right.
You need to wee?
Right, do you want to come with me?
Yeah, I'm going upstairs.
I know.
Who's gon na get upstairs first?
Erm two minutes.
Okay.
Yes.
daffodils out since this morning.
Oh, a clean tidy garden.
You've been cutting the bottom part of the grass?
You had the lawnmower out did you?
Can you put your bib on?
can see lots of birds.
see pigeons.
And you saw a cat as well did you?
Did it?
Oh.
Right, who's going to say thank you?
No thank you.
I'll do it.
Tim.
Tim otherwise it'll go everywhere you see.
You can shake it with me.
Alright you do n't have any then in that case.
Has it been alright today?
Good.
When did everybody get up?
You were all asleep when I er.
I left at twenty to eight.
Oh.
Did you?
You shouted for daddy?
I was already at work.
It's probably just as well cos.
pool his strength for tomorrow.
And Tim's going to.
Holly Cottage tomorrow.
Are n't you?
So you just did your own private trip to the library?
Have they?
Oh.
Really?
Yes.
It's odd.
A bug they're passing around.
Child to child.
Mm.
So it's likely they picked it up from them.
Mm.
No.
And is the parentage alright?
Only strikes children.
Yeah.
Julia ill so she.
wo n't be at work tomorrow.

Sore throat.
It probably needs chopping up.
Mm.
Must be getting better.
So, it's been a nice warm day has it?
Better than the weekend weather that I saw?
It's amazing how the worst weather we've had recently has been on Saturdays and Sundays is n't it?
Did you?
You've been on the swing?
Seemed alright.
Yeah.
No it was a fairly quiet day really.
Not many people seemed to be at work.
Some at meetings.
Like you know all.
the people who went to Pontepool last week?
Well they're all off in Bromsgrove this week.
and big Patrick and Sue.

No it'll be a tiny pudding if you're not gon na eat er finish all that.
You eat just a little bit more.
Cos then you can have a little pudding.
That's it, you eat just a little bit more.
That's very tasty mummy.
Certainly looks as though it's a Rosemary Conley type thing.
Whoops, it's in your eye.
Potato in your eye.
So she's at home alright is she?
Mm.
What else have?
Library this morning and garden this afternoon.
I can imagine actually.
No it must have been nice.
The is more and.
Mm?
Yes.
About a big boat.
What's the big boat?
Oh about the Queen Mary?
I was telling you about the Queen Mary.
Because it was on the back of something which he was making recently.
You know he was cutting out some card.
and I was saying that it's a big boat that used to go across the world.
And when I was a little boy just a little bit bigger than Christopher I was shown round it with granny and grandpa and Uncle Michael and Uncle David.
We went to Southampton to the docks.
I read about it in the paper today.
and it's owned by Walt Disney.
And they're losing so much money they're selling it.
The thing is nobody wants to buy it.
so they're scrap.
Well.
it was a floating restaurant loses money on it.
It was just too expensive to maintain.
Somewhere in the.
I ca n't manage any more I'm afraid mummy.
I might have.
I'm afraid I've had no exercise cos I have n't walked to the shops.
Well I suppose.

Oh we've got Rosie and Jim have we?
Does it?
Rosie and Jim.

Mm.
Does it?
Did he?
Thank you.
It's a chocolate.
It's nice to see a happy family.
A trial weekend was n't it?
Yes the previous Saturday you did n't want it.
The rest of us had it.
The Saturday before that none of us had it cos we were at granny and grandpa's.
Correct.
So you have n't seen grandma presumably just sort of spoke to her?
Have you been out anywhere car.
Yeah.
I'm sure it was.
Mm.
It's nice to walk.
The cassette.
Mum's got to give it back to the man.
Because it belongs to the man.
Very anti-social.
I'm against anti-social things I'm afraid.
I'll only suggest Walkmans.
when the music gets so loud here that you ca n't stand.
So they'll be able to record the excitement that might happen tomorrow.
I wonder what's gon na happen tomorrow.
A week in the life of.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Did it?
Yeah seen it?
Yes Tim, what were you gon na say.
That's what I'm thinking.
Something about Rice Crispies?
Something about going to the shops?
Oh, did n't Christopher go to the library?
Oh.
Somebody else came did they?
Did you?
Did you take a teddy?
Did you?
A picnic.
A picnic for teddies?

Yes.
Cider likes coconut.
Wo n't it?
Why is not on a?
Is it?
I do n't think I've got time to watch all these things.
It's too exciting is n't it?
Oh definitely tonight.
It was n't Bump today you mean?
Oh so it's something new now?
Not Bump.
I'm gon na wash up now.
And then oh it will be reading stories wo n't it?
Right.
Okay.
I expect you can play tummyache while I do.
the washing up.
I'm prepared to wash up.
I, it it's my turn to wash up is n't it?
Cos mummy made the tea.
so daddy does the washing up.
Except it looks as though I wo n't be washing up something here.
It's pie.
He does n't like pie does he?
Has he?
Are you gon na finish it?
So is it okay if I eat it all?
Oh Tim, no.
Yeah.
Cos last week I did n't see Rosie and Jim until nearly the end of the week.
No I do n't mind as long as it's not wiped off.
Tim!
I did watch the jelly one.
Yes.
Wibbly wobbly.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
Why.
trouble videoing.
Did you?
I have n't watched it.
No I have n't seen it.
I've not watched any videos or television all day because I've been hard at work.
It's not about your mum the the window cleaner?
Yes.
I'll do the washing up.
Oh.
Is it?
Right.
Is n't it?
No.
I've seen the puppet show one, yes.
And I saw the science club one about the bones.
I watched that one as well.
Right.
Mind what's it called?
Right.
What's it called?
That's right.
That's right.
That's it.
Walk.
Tim.
If you do n't want to finish it just put it down there and keep quiet.
What are you laughing at?
Right.
Ask mummy for a glass.
Aah, that's why she's not a window cleaner.
That's very good.
Yes.
It's up to you.
Yeah.
That's it.
Right have we said thank Tim before we start.
You have to say thankyou.
Thank you for our breakfast on mummy's birthday.
Amen.
Shh.
Tim chose that one.
Mm that's right.


Hardly.

a look in there?
No, they were n't with me when I bought that.
They know what the other thing is.

Right.
A baby?
Is it?
Dunno.
Little girl.
That might be a little girl Tim.
Mm very very smart.
They all her clothes for her.
for her birthday.
I dunno.
We never got them out in the first place.
So we do n't know.
What would you like to eat?
Do you want some Rice Crispies?
Where are they?
Did you say you bought some?
Ah.
No.
Hope you appreciate the best pottery to celebrate occasion.
It was deliberately.
No no no no no I thought a special celebration.
Need the best only.
Yes, you can have half.
The half?

And you're.
But.

That'll be nice.
I wo n't be there.
It'll be just you and Timothy and mummy and grandma.
Not me cos I'll be at work.
But the rest of you.
I think so.
That's supposed to be the idea.
Is it?
Hippo-bath!
Have n't we?
Oh.
That was n't all that long ago was it?
No that's mummy's that one.
Is that the?
I'm sure it.
Remember on that day we went on that minibus down to the.
station.
Remember?
Yeah.
You were with me, do you remember?
We went on that minibus.
looked at some trains and then went back on the D M U.
That's right, and you were with me.
That's right.
Well while we were doing that mummy was being all these clothes ready for her birthday.
So she's looking very very smart today.
He's already seen it.
but I think I've s seen actually swimming.
Did you have it on when we were at Newtown baths?
Hello mummy.
Erm do n't look in.
in the fridge.
There's something near the bottom of the fridge.
Well I mean you can look in the fridge but do n't look to see what's near the bottom.
It's wra it's wrapped in a bag so.
No.
Yes.
Oh no no no I'd had this hidden somewhere else before you see.
Yes.
Not that particular I hope you wo n't tell mummy our secrets anyway.

No.
No no Erm erm.

I'll try and be home before tea, in reasonable time.
He's had toast.
Well you said you only wanted half.
You're gon na go out to at lunchtime.

Have n't got my knife here have I?
Have you?
Okay, can you put it on the edge of your plate and then we'll have a song or.
What song would you like Christopher?
It's mummy's.
Give it to mummy.

Who which one would you like mummy?
And you'd like Jesus ' Love is Very Wonderful?
Right we'll have that.
Right.
Shall we have a prayer?
Well you can have a song in a minute when we've had a prayer.
Cos I need to go to work now because I'm gon na be late for work.
Right.
Heavenly father we thank you for mummy's birthday.
Thank you for all the fun and excitement we can share.
And please help us today as we go our different ways to work, to school, to nursery.
Please pray that you'll be with each one of us and that we'll enjoy today with grandma and all the different things we'll do.
You'll keep us safe and happy.

Oh my word have the camera.
You ai n't been wearing that all day.

Amen.
You went to the the Jolly Farmers, what for your lunch?
Erm do you want some margarine on, in first?
I think it might help.
What would you like.
Shall I pass it to you?
Yes.
It's a bit hard actually.
Very busy I have n't stopped for a second.
Well I did have a bit of lunch, yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, cos I did n't eat lunch out.
so I have n't stopped, you know, a moment to myself all day, Julie.
Julie went home this morning, you know, you know.
I said she was gon na be ill.
She did, she did come this morning, but er then had a message that she'd gone home.
She says that she's going to go to the doctor tomorrow to get treatment.
Mm, sounded alright.

Mum give you three, right I'll give you one more.
So how's the birthday girl been today?
What you been up too?
Brought the wrong stuff then?
Mm.
So you're starving are you?
Right.
Has anybody been back to school or nursery today?
Been to Holly Cottage?
Not been down the cottage today?
Were there ducks there?
No ducks.
no eggs, no eggs here oh dear.
Erm that's right, everyone's eating with their mouths full.
I mean that, yes, talking with their mouth full.
Oh dear.
Careful.
See it's such an exciting day.
Oh.
really, oh dear.
So you went to town, right and you came home.

Do n't you like your little helpers?
He had a steak and kidney pie.
Not exactly delicate.
At least I did n't have to send mine back, the chap sitting next to me had.

No mummy ca n't granny.
It's mummy's, mummy's birthday.
Yeah, when it's your birthday, everybody does things for you, everybody's nice to you, have you been nice to mummy all day?
So you went to town, did n't buy anything, went to grandma's, picked her up, went to Holly Cottage.
ah, what, you got to Holly Cottage first?
They know you same time.
Right.
Again.
In the cafe, yeah in the cafe.
So Mrs is teaching is she?
How is this gon na.
Yeah you can come and watch anyway.
No they're not, is anybody starving I want.
Yeah, what do you mean by happily being sarcastic?
Mind you, it's probably.
Mm.
Yeah.
This is a bit odd cos Banbury's got a long way to travel.
why did n't they get rid of the train to Banbury?
One an hour.
about one an hour.
O six past the hour.
There's another one.
Yeah, there's two.
Not that cloudy though.
that's it?
Definitely two of them just see the other one's just going over the.
Did you not get on it then?
That's right they only have it off the.
You're not having any.
Right.
I.

That's alright, right shall we sing.
Here we go, let's light them all again cos we've got to come and take a picture, some pictures.
Right you two if you get in close, get in.
Right.
hold Tim.
Right.
Right look at, look at dad.
Mm, wait for grandma.
then I'll take a picture of mummy blowing it, in a minute, ready, cheese grandma.
You all blow.
Just.
I think we had hail stones when we were in.
You come and do it here Tim or you sit down there.
Have you?
Was that nice?
I'm a bit older than mummy.
One year yeah that's right.
That's right.
Just over half a year.

This one with chocolate was more expensive than the other one.
one, yes, erm, was another lady and child, taking beeline for birthday cake, you know, they went out the same checkout as I did.
cos erm, usually on a Monday there's hardly anybody there at all, you know, they I should think we represented half the you know, just.
Does anybody want any more tea?
Maybe it's getting a bit cold by now.
Is n't it?
Had to do some washing up at work today.
For nine.
nine people.
Gilbert, Gilbert insisted that we provide coffee for all the people.
so erm, he went to speak to one of the Director's secretary, to go and buy all the cups, I had to provide the sugar.
and er, then of course Gilbert went off for another reason to.
I had to do the washing up.
He does look young.
No he is n't, no he's round about my age.
Might be a year or two younger.
Gosh these two boys.
for the birthday girl.
Well done Tim, eight there.
It's this game.
So you want.
I did actually go into Sainsbury's on the way home, but I.
Yeah.
I'm surprised at that.
They have.
They had.
individual things, you can buy sort of individual cream cakes and things like that from the bakers actually, you ca n't buy like individual ones.
So we're gon na get the original magazine or have you already got it?
All the house will be burnt down.
and be very, very sad.
Yes.
Yes all of us could get burnt.
and your guitar, everything.
So you wo n't play with matches?
I did.
No.
Yeah, I'll play with you, do you want to play cars?
Bricks.
and cars then we'll have a story.
Right Tim I think you've got enough over here.
Tim can you come and.
Yeah, are you going to help me?
Right, Tim can we come and play please?
Tim do n't bring everything over.
I do n't think you need everything.
many things.
What you going to play with?

Oh that would be nice, I could hear them over here.
Who some of these.
I shouted breakfast is ready and then I started my breakfast, cos you had gone upstairs were n't you?
Is that enough milk Christopher it's very good.
I think I'm looking forward to a normal day honey.
This is.
Bit of a.
I were n't very good I'm afraid.
It's.
What day is it today?
Yes, on a Wednesday, this is the day when mummy goes teaching at school in the afternoon.
Christopher's school.
and do you still have story time.
Yes he did, with Imogen.
Erm, you did n't tell me anything about what said.
want to swap it over.
Certainly not a whole that one.
Erm apparently.
Erm especially.
I just wondered.

You did n't say anything about that.
No,.
actually.
they.
the one that we see.
yeah, ah, ah, she's seen the catalogue, ah.
I see.
oh yeah.
I thought it was going to be a magazine?
Yes, yes.
Oh I see, so he's even more liked.
I see, oh.

Oh Tim.
Anyway.
They've both got whole.
That's it.
They they both had half a whole, I thought that's what you said half a whole.

Teach us what age are they?
What age will she teach then?
Yeah.
we have got half a whole.
Oh, they've also got half a.
I thought I was making the best of both answers.
Empty now Tim?
Tim erm licked your knife, right can we erm have a I've got to go in a minute.
I wish to choose.
Oh dear.
A wise man built his house upon the rock, a wise man built his house upon the rock, the wise man built his house upon the rock and the rain came tumbling down, and the rain came down and the flood came up and the rain came down and the flood came up.
the rain came down and the floods came up and the house on the rocks slid down, but the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the rain came tumbling down.
splish, splash and the rain came down and floods came up, the rain came down and the floods came up, the rain came down and the floods came up and the house on his band fell flat.

Do it again.
do it lot's and lot's.
I was, estimate normal time.
Yeah I know.
Bye Tim.
Bye, bye everybody.
But it's more convenient for you to go in that church if anybody else.
Nice school?
No.
Did it come off once did n't it?
Best to let it.
I've put it on the stairs you see so it's got like double height to go to, it's nearly filled that, the thing is, the.
at the bottom then about six foot gap and then.
at the top.
the.
the branch goes to the top.
Mm.
The trouble is that.
I could help with maths.
I was gon na say Mike has had a degree in that.
What you'd have to do, you know, you tell him what you need to know, he'll be able to tell you how to do it.
It's good book though is n't it?
but it, he needs to find out what he needs to teach you through the book so you know.
books are they.
I can just remember though you know over the.
What I could never do was.
but I could never do them.
Well you should of been learning those.
I ca n't remember.
We learnt them by chart.
I'll take Wednesday.
I could never do those of, I never got one of those right.
You do n't have to have English?
Brilliant cos I.
We've all stood teaching, I've got maths I have n't got English.
I can do an essay to prove I can.
Right this is er.
I have you know I've been going round and testing how many miles per galleon you can get out of it.
per galleon, yeah.
It's surprising.
Why not, you should put one of hers on and say it was patterned.
We've raised half that size.
I'm not sure which.
The size.
And then you go back to one or something.
at one stage.
It's.
is n't it?
Here.
Is that alright?
Do you want that bacon chop Tim cos I do n't think you'll find it you wo n't eat it all?
Chop that up and you'll get a bit more to go with it.
the garden, was it a nice day?
A big tummy.
Yes.
Why was that?
Are they all ill this week?
What did you do Tim at mothers and toddlers?
Yeah, what did you play with?
Anything special?
The prince and the.
A story.
Looking in the windows?
Aah.
Is this er Christopher's book?
The one about mummy.
Yeah mummy, mummy the window cleaner went to rescue some people along came the fireman.
Yeah, be direct.
to the point.
You like the ginger bread man?
But what I did before yes, one or two did.
Did you have a.
Did you?
Yeah.
To you, eat lots of biscuits.
Did you eat all the sandwiches, all the cake and all the banana?
He must be.
Your throat hurts as well what's all this throat hurting?
I've got a sore throat too.
Probably not very erm.
Careful Christopher.
Christopher just be careful.
Oops they're smart are n't they?
Not got buns now chocolate pies.
Christopher you come up here and you know talk to me.
Yep.
My staff could n't cope with the day.
Marg went home this morning.
No, day before.
No.
just being herself.

I thought not, especially the.
do double exercise then.
I could see there's a gap there now so.
Oh.
Ca n't see it.
Record, what is it?
I see.
Yeah.
Has it?
Have n't seen Rosie and Jim, have n't watched any telly this weekend.
Have n't watched Rosie and Jim, Love Piglet.
I wanted to watch.
There's one about.
erm.
something about delivering a letter was n't it?
That's Play Bus is it?
I do n't think it's Play Bus.
There's a letter in Worcestershire as well.
There's a local programme there.
Mm, no, well there's lots of things I have n't seen, I have n't had time this week.
Right I'm not allowed to watch it any more.
Did he help you with the gardening?
Yes, yes.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I have n't, no.
I have n't got time to see.
And I think about admiral was about erm.
bones, bones was the last one I saw.
good.
Is it?
No I have n't.
You ca n't wash up, it's my turn to wash up is n't it?
I.
This one here, what you supposed to be doing?
I did erm, Christopher's.
cost thirty pounds and.
Yes.
Yes Tim.
The last I saw was.
when he went to Stratford, and did he watch the puppets?
That's right.
the horse one.
Oh.
yes.
Yeah.
I thought that was you Tim.
But that was Christopher's was n't it?
Cos Christopher had his on his head, do you remember?
Can I have my ring back?
Can I have my ring back and then Christopher can go and look for the ring that he had on his head, he had a wooden one on his head, do you remember?
Who would have children?
But not at dinner times.
Stop.
He ca n't.
Yeah, before Tim tipped it all over the mat and all over the.
not the carpet, what do you call it?
Table cloth.
Yeah.
I'll take your er cassette player.
I do n't know.
tomorrow we'll leave for.
at four o'clock is that right?
Have you got any money?
Well I've got no money, you'll have to pay the dentist.
Alright.
Have you got any cash?
It will be nice.
I do n't know.
what mummy and daddy.
It's only.
I do n't know, I mean we can either take him up to.
or if he wants to.
No.
whoever, which one of us is there decides to, of course if he decides this after the service you ca n't stay there very long.
So, whoever takes me, you know.
By then we'll know where to go.
I think it's on the A ten, erm.
I, no,.
Yeah.
yeah.
there's too much.
Two days.
The er.
she'll never manage all that.
Where's your bib Tim?
going to be recorded everything.
Certainly my dear.
Work work and more work.
suppose Julia will be there.
boss.
Do n't suppose Julia will be there.
My boss is getting to the position where he wants lots of information from me.
Last night, before I came home he dragged me into his office to work out how much money we spend Pontypool delivering parts to Solihull.
We had, we had to work it out.
Yeah.
I sat with a price list.
He sat with a calculator.
He only did that simply because he gets asked questions.
Thing I do n't approve of is the fact that when I ask questions.
that he needs and he needs to speak to his boss, he does n't get answers from his boss.
But when his boss chases him for, you know information or whatever you know.
It's stopped has it?
I'm afraid the toast was n't very square shaped.
Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something.
Well it did get squashed.
Did you see?
What's happened to the loaf?
Somebody must have sat on it, or pulled it or.
No.
You'll find your sandwiches at work will be a little, your sandwiches at school will be a little bit squashed.
Well he works.
You know what I meant.
Course he does.
Works very hard.
And I had to spend a whole hour in a meeting not not an hour, two and a half hours in a.
meeting with the French yesterday with.
To listen to the French to say non.
You know.
the French say non.
Except they did n't quite say non, one word.
They said it in a round about way for two and a half hours.
We knew they were coming to say non.
That's why the meeting had been arranged.


Ooh, a cat.
I think all the.
big green pellet things.
That's right.
Yes.
And what's Tim going to eat?
does n't it?
The amount of toast consumed.
How's your throat today?
Your throat's hurting is it?
Oh.
Poor Tim.
So's mine.
If you said please may I have the marmalade it might arrive.
Right in front of you.
He did n't ask for it.
He just said where is it.
Just say, please can I have it.
Easy.
Easy-peasy.
You're supposed to sit down to eat Tim.
Remember?
Right.
Thank you.
So, this afternoon.
we gather at the dentist at four o'clock.
You'll get there just before.
Erm will you be able to take some money?
Right.
Cos it costs so much now.
I think they put the rate up did n't they?
Recently.
Yeah.
He just remembers these things.
No, Ruth's.
Your cousin.
Yes, you remember.
Ruth and Ann.
and Uncle David and Auntie Gwen.
Do you remember them?
We went to stay in their house one weekend.
And we went with them to the zoo.
Do you remember?
Remember going to the zoo?
We went on a little steam train as well.
Yes.
That's right.
Cos there's only one train.
It was going round and round was n't it?
So are we all being examined today?
Right.
Yeah.
Something like that.

Presuming that our dentist still wants to do National Health Service work.
Cos most of them are threatening to give up are n't they?
Yeah.
Private work.
Cos they say they do n't get paid enough money for the N H S.
No.
For everybody.
The vast majority of dentists have threatened to.
Well because you'd have to pay even more if you did it privately.
Have you?
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Are we gon na have a song?
I should n't be here.
I'm late.
It's got to be very very quick.
Right.
Can we have a prayer?
Right.
just gon na have a prayer, right.

Heavenly father.
we pray that you'll be with us today.
That you'll help us as we go out.
Go to nursery and school and work and do different things.
Pray that we'll listen to you.
To help us to be friends to those we meet.
That you'll look after and keep us safe until the end of the day.
Amen.
Be bold.
be strong.
be bold.
be strong.
Bubye funny.
