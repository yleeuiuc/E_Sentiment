The cra we'll bring everything up.

Cos I could we could do with getting a a case, erm do you think we need a case of cans of Pils?

A couple of cases or something?

And fifteen quid of erm.

So that's twenty five cases?
Okay.
Where is he do you know?
Ken?
Well, he's at some de there's some firms do or something on apparently.
that he's got should.
should make an appearance at or something.
I mean, nothing happens till.
No.
I mean it's just when er, he's basically.
going for the bus innit?
That.
Yeah.
Cos it were sat there with er couple of, couple of cans of lager.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
Well one of them went to erm one of them went to the er toilet or something and left a an open full can there and Hughey, so Hughey just picked it up.
oh thank you!
He said, eh you, you ca n't do that!
What d'ya think you're doing here?
So I helped.
Yeah.
Erm.
No I think it was, I think it was just over two hundred on, but I do n't think it was.
Nah!
I think she's getting carried away a bit there.
She, probably try and impress on us how hard she worked.
No.
Oh dear!
Eh?
True.
I was gon na say, I did n't think it was your type of music.
Innit?
Yeah.
Why what is your type.
of music?
Mm.
Mm.
Better than Thursday night when Mick's doing it, when he's doing the er sort of thrash metal for.
an hour and half solid!
A bit heavy going.
I sound like, I sound like my mum and dad though when I'm criticizing it, you know.
All sounds the same, it's just a noise and you know, you ca n't th the words!
You sound like your mum and dad criticizing the music, you know.
Sixties and seventies.
Mm.
No that's right.
So, anyway, it's not even that is it?
It's all computerized today.
so er.
electrical effects and.
Well if I knew who the hell Dawn's brother was!

Yeah.
I did.
My hero!
Shut up!
Hughey!
How are we off for Newquay?
Ah!
Right.
Okay.
Well what time are you coming next, next week?
Yeah.
Mm.
Ooh!
Oh yeah, yeah.
See she sounds like a wimp though.
My anguish, my life's shattered sort of thing!
God!
The last thing I'd do when I get Mr.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I.
I think it's, I think that's erm well it's not exactly a bluff, but it's, it's a case of er what they hope will happ hope will happen.
Er I do n't think are pulling out but they, they've suspended things, but I mean they just do n't know if they're competing.
They just the politics.
I mean, they ca n't possibly erm you know, cos they.
ca n't, you ca n't accuse just Jean of corruption, they've got to they've got to accuse the development corporation of corruption as well.
You know, cos you ca n't be corrupt just on one person, you've got ta have two people playing.
but, you know.
So th to a, you know, and as said, you know we erm we do n't need to bribe anybody to come into Morecambe.
You know nobody else would come in!
You know, that's just my point, you know.
No.
Oh well!
It just, I think it, I think it affected us last week so erm cos the, the Friday night was well down.
It was only, only about ninety people two hundred people Friday.
I think it was overspeculated in the press that we've sold the premises and it, it well gave the impression that perhaps we might be open you know, some people might not think we're open even.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
And if you're coming through from Lancaster, you know, as soon a it's a far old drag innit?
After the pubs are closed, on the off-chance, I mean, cos if you get here what the hell do you do if not as if you've got an alternative is there?
You know.
If yo if you're gon na come here yo you're the ki not on a Saturday night, you're not the kind of clientele that's gon na go to the Empire.
Prince's Tea Rooms and so you got ta traipse all the way back into Lancaster to go.
to The Alley.
Mm.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh!
Hello Mark.
Are you su are you sure the heating's on?
I know.
I just wonder sometimes when Terri turns things on.
Last last time she put the ventilation on instead.
Can you just hang about here I'll just go and check.
Bet it's blasting cold air out for an hour!
Cor!
It's the, blasting the heat out in there Mark.
I do n't know.
Yes.
It's phew!
What a scorcher!
There's people up there in their underpants!
Yes.
Why?
Well, what we're doing is putting the erm ha!
We're putting the the tannoy system back in.
Into operation.
Well you know the oogamyflip's du in there.
Four speakers around the dance floor and er two big bass things.
Mick's gon na, getting those together and.
Well yeah.
Yeah, but it was only really, we had that we had those soul D Js that, that, that were blowing them that was the problem.
And they should n't have blown.
True.
I hear you were at the Empire the other night?
How many were in?
That bad is it?
Yeah.
How much is it to get in?
Yeah well I mean a quid a pint or something is n't it?
I mean, so there's he's still making a reasonable mark- up on that.
I mean well, not a reasonable mar he's still making money on the drinks.
it's not as if you're like selling them at cost and making a few pence because.

Yeah.
Really?
Oh!
Your la your lads?
Is that the one that they had some problems with the er rugby club?


The band or the rugby club?


Mm.
Because there's only a couple, they only had a couple of security guards did n't they?
Well.
Nigel was saying that they only had a couple, you know, cos they like you.
Oh yeah.
Paul?
He used to be.
he used to, he used to do bouncer there, yeah.
Yeah.
He was here from the very first cos he worked for Hills, you know that sort of.
gangster crew from Blackpool!
Erm, he worked, he was their sort of erm they had a few clubs and pubs in this area at the time and er.
he was that sort of head of the.
And troubleshot around various establishments.
Then he went so solo, he he got erm er doing regular thing up at erm Ocean Heads I think, or summat.
But definitely so he sort of went on his own and then went back into building and decorating and then when the Empire opened he started there from the off.
But now he sort of seems to be with other contracts.
Cos the last I see he's been made redundant now has n't he?
Oh!
You do n't know it, you wo n't know it then.
Then Mar this guy called Mark is there I think.
But Paul's head over that now so I mean he's doing well for himself.
I wa I was told you had got one.
I was told you'd got one or two?
In fact, I was told you'd got two nights!
Well it was from the er you know Radio Lancashire Nigel misfit!

Walking round bit of Pathay News!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's booked a load of bands ai n't he?
What d'ya think they but I mean, well, I mean I'm a little bit out of touch on that sort of.
level, I mean.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean if that does, er er, I mean Two Unlimited ought to do alright.
If.
if it, if it's gon na do alright then that'll be.
reasonable.
But it's getting a bit carried away, I mean, he was talking to Nigel about er doing er the Levellers in er.
in the tent, you know.
Doubt if you put, oh, we can put four and half thousand people into that!

Seven hundred in the Sugar House maybe.
Yeah, but yeah.
Difference between playing Guild Hall and filling Guild Hall.
Yeah.
I know.
but I would, I would n't have sa.
I would n't, I, I mean, yeah, but I mean I would n't have thought I mean they're certainly.
No.
I mean I would n't.
No.
I would have thought that for Morecambe they're probably looking at like a thousand eleven hundred people if, you know.
would be a good one.
I would have thought.
Depends on timing.
Hello Kenneth?
Who's doing a Wednesday night then?
Yep.
Right.
Mm.
What is it on Wednesday, is it ten till, ten till two, or nine till two or.
what do they do a bus shuttle?
It's a long haul that innit though?
Here.
I mean, how many students are from Morecambe nowadays?
Er, d'ya know?
Must be a fair number.
No.
No, no, no.
I mean we when I when I came here it was virtually, virtually half, half the population of that.
And then there was maybe a thousand people out of out of Morecambe.
That's it.
And the Uni was then only about two thousand eight hundred strong.
Yeah.
Is it?
Some of it is.
I thought some of it was the Uni.
But, you know, I mean, if the Uni goes to ten thousand in what what is it, it's getting up for about ninety five, ninety six?
It's quite quick.
It's.
very quick really.
Yeah, I mean that, well it's only fo well it's four, five thousand now?
But I mean you're talking.
It's five.
Well, whatever.
You're talking about.
doubling in size basically are n't you in, in in the next three years?
That's going some!
Yeah.
I know, it's unpleasant innit?
Aye.
Is he?
Must have got some student then?
Mind you, it's convenient for the Sugar House innit?
I mean I always thought, I always thought The Tramway The Yorkshire, and were always gon na do quite well out the Sugar House.
but in actual fact it, it was only really The Yorkshire House did anything direct.
out of it.
And, cos Carole went in.
Yeah.
Really, I mean.
Yeah.
What you talking about, The Firing Arm?
Yeah.
There's that free house, that's quite a one innit?
Just along the er.
The Lord Nelson or whatever it's called.
Lord Ashton, that's it.
It used to be The Safe did n't it?
I well it's not.
i it's have you been in since they did it up?
And it's er bi bigger now than when it was befo I mean, before it was all I remember when they stuck a pool table in there and it was bloody dreadful!
Went down to play pool once and I ha two pool teams in there and you could n't move in the place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That might be an idea, a DJ.
There is!
There's two punters.
Well that's cos the records are crap!
Oh yeah!
And he's a funny old guy!
And I was n't even talking when, I did n't know him from we were talking to him one night.
I mean he does n't have, sort of, consistent opening or anything he opens when he fancies does n't he?
Half se half seven.
eight o'clock at night and yeah, that's right.
Mm.
Evening.
Yeah it was.
No!

Ken!
Are you coming back down?
Can you bring me a pint of lime and lemon with some i lots of ice?
Cheers, thanks.
What, in the Lord Ashton?
Does he ah he does meals do n't he?
What are they like?
Have you e.
No.
Oh.
Ha!
He did have er when he opened, of course, he was one of the few houses to have in Lancaster to have Boddy did n't they?
They had Boddys on the bar.
Yeah, I know, but like everybody's got Boddys now ai n't they?
And Whitbread's taken them over bunging them in everywhere are n't they?
I mean it only, it only used to be like the The Plough and and The Bath and er New Inn and.
innit really and now every pub, as I say every pub's got it on tap.
I mean, it's not as nice a pint as now that Whitbread's have taken over and half the time.
The one on Lancaster Road?
Babkins yeah.
God!
I have n't been in there for years!
And th when it was the Lancastrian you know.
Used to have a disco upstairs.
One of the first pubs in Lancaster.
to have a disco up a regular part of the pub.
Yeah.
Or the Lancastrian as it.
was then.
Who?
Oh yes.
No, ask me she wo n't be around then.
What?
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well I mean, are you planning on talking to them beforehand?
Well.
it's not too bad, it does n't matter what you play.
Yeah, I mean, as long as it, as long as it kind of they know that it might change slightly after eleven.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fine.
You wan na do it from what, half eight el half eight they wanted till eleven or.
No problem!
How many are you talking about?
How much is it?
Yeah I was gon na say, I've heard these before!
Private bookings.
I've given out three hundred invites and sit around with.
twenty people.
Aha.
Right.
Mm.
When's the when is the wedding, or when's the reception?
And where?
I reali I realized it was on the same day Mark.
No, a time what time are they planning.
Is there a gap, I mean how big is the gap between like the reception and the party kind of thing?
I mean, are they likely to run into one another?
Are people likely to stay in one and.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got oh the Gallgate.
What?
Right there in Morecambe.
And be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who is it?
Are they people I know and not rough.
How d'ya know them?
I mean what's, who is it?
Yeah.
They've been in here and they still want you to do the disco!
Hey!
I'm Mark.
Eh!
I tell you.
what last Saturday.
I had Alistaire singing your praises!
Alistaire, as in loony, psychopath Alistaire!
Well, he was talk we were talking about the rave and th what was wrong with it and he was saying basically it was they'd got four DJs who were all techno and they were like brilliant!
He said, you know that you wo n't get better.
you know, they're, and the scratching guy he said is best he's ever heard anywhere.
He said, but it's the same all night long, you know.
And I said, well I know nothing about that kind of music but that's the impression I got, I was just stood there at the bar thinking that last, last Friday it's not the same one, thinking, you know, this is just this is just very samey it.
sounds really samey.
So erm oh, cheers mate!
So he said yeah, he said it's like, you know it's like if played erm.
you know, thrash all night long on a Saturday night you're gon na have fifty, sixty people who think it's wonderful but you're never gon na get more than fifty, sixty people.
Erm so he ju he was taking it over for a couple of weeks.
Anyway.
cutting a long story short.
Saying how good you were.
He said to say, cos he, we were talking about DJs in general and how basically if performing artist if anything else, you know, you've still got ta react to your audience and all that sort of thing.
and he's er yes er.
He was saying you taught, he, he taught him everything he knows!
This did n't say Alistaire that I know and love.
He was saying how he used to stand awestruck in the Sugar House and listen to you all night long!
I thought he always there.
I thought Mark in the Sugar House he was drunk.
most of the time.
You know.
And anyway you ought to try, you ought to have tried telling him a few!
No, No.
I mean this was like this was like.
midday on a Saturday.
Yeah.
No adrenalin buzzing, no.
Well he does n't drink any more but.
Aye.
He was actually reasonably reasonably pleasant.
Except when he went off into fi fantasy land.
Battling up and down motorways in cars!
Sorting out drug dealers the length and breadth of the British Isles!
Yeah.
Rob Roy.
What was that from?
Yeah.
Sounds like Trevor to me.
Is Trevor still buying?
What happened with Brooks?
It's what?
Oh yeah!
Ye yeah.
Er er I know, I know.
I just wonder what's I last I heard they were the receiver was trying to pull it into the collapse but er.
Well it's the only club in, in Lancaster that's that's the problem.
Well I mean the Sugar House is.
is.
a student place and always will.
be and.
What Brook?
Oh I know.
Yeah but it's a club.
and there's no alternative is there?
Hi Ken!
Yeah.
Must be twenty come in without and paying, and I've let a few in for.
bit less than two fifty.
So it's not bad.
Do n't know how the bar's coping though.
Are they?
Yeah.
Got no er no change at the moment that's the only problem.
I just send er.
Alan.
Alan.
Got some at home apparently tucked away in a piggy bank or something.
How many.
were on the bus then?
No, well.
Mm.
Yeah, we had like fifty in before, fifty, or sixty.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Well it's a bad time of year ai n't it since Christmas?
I mean January.
anyway, I mean, and then all the sort of ups and downs with the press publicity etcetera.
Well I was just talking to Jean about that today, I mean I we've got ta keep on doing it but, I think that.
No that's right.
But I mean I think we, I think I, I will need on Monday morning to talk to er Morecambe Bay and see if I can bring forward these promotions because.
until I start.
I mean, we should get them back.
I know.
The trouble is it's a bit of a catch twenty two because if you do n't put a bus on, will you get the people?
the bus for er.
and nobody on it.
Mm mm.
Mm.
I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm something that's obviously our crowd and then either putting, say, Stella back on or something like that.
and banging it out for one.
Well.
frankly I'm not sure where that stands.
I mean talking to Charlie, just asking about getting some student bands on.
might be an idea cos remember when we had that thin Mar.
when we had that thin Martin's band on.
I mean.
Yeah.
They brought a big following.
Yeah, that's right.
There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
That's right.
So.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
But I, I say if I get sh publicity I er if I say do, if I say cos we have n't got a premium lager on draft so if I stick Stella on draught.
and then do it as an offer.
Okay.
Great!
Yeah.
Great!
Get it up to Terri.
Is it like cold out?
Is it?
Mm.
Oh!
Well, mind you, that.
Yeah.
Must be war.
must be warmer then must n't it?
Seven, seven.
Seven.
quid each?
Couple of quid each?
It's two for a quid normally.
Well I thought.
Well,.
Afraid not.
Only in.
Is that alright?
I do n't know.
One, one.
It do n't matter, he's got hundreds of them downstairs!
There's hundreds of them downstairs!

Come on!
You'll only spend it at the bar otherwise.
Oh!
What!
Two o'clock.
That's disgusting!
Yeah.
Right.
The trouble is that it I know, I say I'm going on about have n't got a copper and everything, then they walk up to the bar and pull out a great wad of notes.
out of it, out of it, out of the pocket!
When do you start when do you start fishing again then?
D'ya think?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
What, you go out in the i is it in the summer when you go out the boat?
Or the erm spring or summat?
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you go out far?
Or do you just you fe in a.
in a boat or do you go out far?
Yeah I know.
Yeah.
Mm.
How long how long can you stay out?
I mean I, you know, how long does th.
how long's the tide and that?
Yeah, but then you're going out a distance are n't you?
Yeah.
No, I mean if you just keep using the bay.
the bay.
Mm.
Can you?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
What's it like around the power station?
Is, is there, is there, are they ploughing warm water into, into there or is it.
Yeah.
Well I presume, I presumed there was.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean is it affecting any of that good fishing up there or is that.
that a.
Mm.
Yeah.
Right.
Mm.
Is there much mackerel around?
Yeah.
See, it's not a bad fish to eat actually, mackerel.
Mind you, we do n't eat fish.
And I went to last summer we took a er I took a sha er not a sha erm tt static caravan in, at er Prestatyn an and erm.
and like, we were just flicking through Ceefax on the telly and it was like one of these luxury six berth ones and it was ninety nine quid for a week and, and.
I mean it was beautiful inside!
They're normally like a two hundred and fifty, three hundred quid one.
but it was it was cos you had you know, you had to go that week kind of thing.
So we just thought well then.
Erm I took the nine year old boat out and just went out in a boat we had Mary went as well, we were like the all job for mackerel put this guy's.
twelve guys on, that's what I did n't want two small mackerel caught in over.
three hours, you know.
Poor guy was going, well I do n't understand it, you know, normally we Went to erm Malta last year and there was a great erm tt it's called an underwater safari, but, you know, normally when you're, like on Windermere like you've got a glass-bottomed boats.
well this was the all, the ho all the hull underneath the water line was glass so you were actually sitting you know, you were n't looking down, you were actually sitting in, in the base of the hull of the boat.
and, and going, and they went er it went out in, off to er some of these islands off er rocks and that, tour of Malta and that it was superb!
You were abs you know you were er absolute, I mean it was, it was.
as good as aqualunging without actually getting wet, it was great you know!
Very good idea that.
Must have made a fortune!
It was packed like three or four times a day.
I mean people are fascinated by the sea are n't they?
They really are.
Oh yeah!
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Marlin big marlin.
That's what they call big marlin.
Yeah.
It's not much really is it?
They pay that in bloody mackerel fishing.
for the twelve hours do n't you?
Yeah.
Have you seen that.
have you seen that movie, it was on erm tt I was watching a programme the other day about it.
They've developed a camera for your line for th for the mackerel, for the ma marlin and the shark fishing erm and basically you can actually watch you can, you can ac you've got a your T V screen so it, it's er, it's like a spectator sport as well cos you can actually watch the, the, the fish coming to take your bait.
You know, so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything, you know so it, so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it you know, coming and taking.
Yeah you can.
Course you can.
Couple of quid each.
Shark fishing's only.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Give us three quid for the pair of you.
Cheers.
The guy was talking to Pete, he thought he could, he develop, he could develop for coarse fishing.
er, you know river fishing and that as well, there's spa special camera.
It's hung, it it's hung, i i it's actually not below the boat but, but it.
get it, you see, but i it's fantastic watching cos you know they were they, they it was sort of going along the.
whatever they were using as bait presumably some mackerel or something like that but, but as I was saying you could see it trailing through and then all, suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like chase after it.
and snap and this, this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then, you actually.
see it take it, you know.
I presume so, yes.
I mean they was talking about getting a really small for erm.
you know, to be, to be used in in sort of coarse fishing and that.
But, of course, the other thing of course, i it takes out the, the one that got away cos you actually see the one that got away.
you know?
There'd be some story then.

Yeah it will.
It will do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was really, I mean it, it meant of course that the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse i if you if there's only one rod out, or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on, on.
those for the marlin and the and the sharks and that, fishing?
Yeah.
And it's not like, sort of.
twelve.
twelve rods out, yeah.
Yeah.
So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically!
But at least.
if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going.
on.
So now, now I mean now with all the radar and whatever else we're using, I mean you should really be able to find fish.
Mm.
Yeah.
No.
No, that's right.
That's right.
They've done most of them are I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little little boat trips and that, I mean, they have all it does is that it'll tell you there's some fish about, I mean, it does n't.
tell you where to fish or.
depths or anything like that does it?
What they're doing is there's some fish down there somewhere.
Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like you know, you could be wasting that, you, you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole, there's not a fish anywhere round here!
You know, you could be sat here like an idiot today.
for hours on end.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do n't know what's going on.
I do n't we got about three, three thirty in the morning, both of them went out to er canal somewhere up Dulgate, past Dulgate we set up and we'd we'd been fishing for about two and half hours it's aba about six thirty in the morning this old farmer comes up says er aye, aye lads, he said er I would n't bother it, they drained this area of the canal a few months ago!
And we said, oh!
Sat there watching our floats for hours!
I mean.
I mean luckily you, you know, you'd gone on a car, with a car so it's a matter of throwing everything in the back and just going.
somewhere else so could have sat there all bleeding day!
And not have known anything about it.
Yeah.
Do you catch many eels, eels or anything, many eels?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
A delicacy.
Mind you, I ate conga.
I, I erm, I was off the west co er on a holiday to the west coast of Ireland and we erm we're driving down the west coast and there was like some rocks and everything about, so we stopped and, you know, I looked by a rock pools or something, and there's this and the rock pool is like mini-swimming baths, they were, you know, probably.
twelve foot long and about six or seven foot wide and about.
six or seven foot deep and they're crystal clear.
And there was this old guy dragging this bloody rope with a massive hook on the end like after after, you know, I presume it was cod or mackerel something along the and I said, what the hell are you fishing?
You know cos the woman I was with wanted to go for a swim and I said no you ca n't this guy, so I went up to him, I said what, what on earth are you fishing for?
He said, oh there's three congas live in this pool.
It was like a four foot one, a five foot one, there's a six foot one over in the centre, there's a rock in the centre of it.
that came out the water said look over there.
I said bloody hell!
You know, and I said to her you were gon na go swimming in there!
He said ooh, he said there was some American students here last week and they were all swimming in there and the man came along with this thing and they bo they were all sat on the middle lo middle of there with their feet dangling in the water splashing away, he said I was dragging this down and this six footer came out, I said, and then they were he said, you've never seen anybody run so fast in your life like they go.
they were dangling their toes at the end of this thing.
Yeah.
And then, the next day I went along and he actually caught the five foot one and ki and killed it and he gave us a load of steaks off it that I sort of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The trouble was they were really bony, that's the only thing it was and I do n't like eating.
fish and bo with bones in I ca n't stand it.
No.
No.
Impossible.
No.
Cos it's like a central spinal.
and it's all off it so you'd be just you know, it's not like.
a fish, a flat fish.
I mean, but it was really nice it was it was a really chewy meat you know.
But.
like shark or something and er.
Is there?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
They're ugly looking fish are n't they?
Bloody horrible fish!
But er evil looking things.
This guy was great though we met in Ireland cos he was erm he used to own about three or four supermarkets, er small chains and he just one day, he's about he's about fifty eight, sixty now and one day he said about five years ago he just got fed up and just walked out.
All he does is fish all day long.
And he.
just, he lives in somebody's basement of a house, and like, in return for living there he fills the guy's freezer up with lobster, crab, you know.
fish and that and erm everything he does in the village i in Kilrush is everything, he just you know, he wants a new pair of shoes, wants a coat brings.
a couple of lobster, you know, and things like tha cos like to him he, he's got his crab lines and his lobster pots all the time and all that.
Erm to, it's really back to the old barter system.
It's superb!
Really good.
No.
What?
Oh right.
Oh!
Do you want one?
Yeah.
go on, go on.
Just tell, send Alan down again.
Er no I have n't.
I mean, squid I've eaten a lot of.
Yeah.
I like shark.
Have you eaten shark?
Oh I like shark, it's really nice cos it it's really meaty, I mean, it's like eating meat.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's like steak.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's sort of thick and chewy it's not, you know it's not flaky like fish, it's like a almost like a meat.
It's really good.
They do in erm where do they do it round here always?
Erm always got it in erm tt oh!
Mick at Joseph's place, Mick and Jose erm in Lancaster.
Oh God!
Above the Bang and Olufsen shop in Lancaster, d'ya know Robertson's of Leicester?
Yeah.
Next to Plato's.
Yeah.
It's above there.
So it's a it's a nice place cos it's like it they do a great spread of I mean you can go for like a nice meal there, but you can like also eat, you know dips and.
hamburger.
or whatever, a big steak or whatever you want and the.
They cook it i they cook it in er Cajun, in, it's a, sort of, in a sort of spice thing, they have sort of Mexican, not Mexican erm tt Cajun, South American, and.
some states of America around the Mississippi New Orleans.
New Orleans.
Er but I've had it just grilled, you know and always done in butter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
You ca I mean you occasionally see it in the fish markets.
And er I mean, things like squid and that I ca I quite like, but I'd never think of get buying it, I would n't buy it and cook it myself or anything.
I just.
the trouble is, once you actually.
so what sorry?
I remember once, you know, getting and cutting a rabbit and things, by the time you'd actually cut the thi damn thing.
you'd gone off it cos you'd been heading, and gutting it, and whatever else!
And you know, you're sat there and you think.
I do n't really wan na eat this, you know!
It's alright if it comes to you in a ca in a, in a, as a, as a meal.
Yeah.
But er, when you actually see what you're doing to it, you know.
Mm.
Mm.
You would n't have had it if you'd have known?
No.
No.
No.
I would n't.
I certainly.
would n't.
I mean I like fish but I would n't, I would n't choose it.
Yeah.
What was it, a sort of fishy ta I mean was it a sort of fishy soup?
No?
Mm.
No.
Yeah.
So if you do n't eat what you catch why choose.
sea fishing?
No, I mean I, cos I, you know I, i I spend a long time coarse fishing so I understand actual fishing for pleasure as opposed to.
like to eat, you know, there's not much you can catch coarse fishing that you can eat anyway erm but most people who go sea fishing do it to eat what they catch.
Or to sell what they catch or whatever, I mean.
But why sea fi why, why does sea fishing interest you and not coarse fishing sort of thing?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
There has n't been many now.
What.
time is it now?
Oh is it?
Oh!
There wo n't be any.
No you'll enjoy that.
Actually.
it's good, I mean it's good because of the amount of lighting and effects that they bring, I mean it's interesting like, you know.
But yo you come for an hour or so and then, tha that'll be enough.
you know, if you do n't li if you're not into the music or into dancing then.
No.
No.
That's right.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heavy rock.
Yeah.
There'll be just over two hundred in.
Mm.

But.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er, no, no, we were, I mean last night we'd gone up from the week before on a rave, we'd had about si ninety in, and last night we had about two hundred and fifty.
So.

Well it's i.
er, er er er, er it, it has n't been, I mean, i it, it was, last night was the first one that had gone on to like over two hundred.
Yeah.
That's right.
No.
No.
But I mean it's, now it's coming to the end of January people are starting to get paid again and starting to have paid off their Christmas.
I mean that's been the killer.
You know, you've had Christmas, then you get hit with all your credit cards and all, then you get hit with all the electricity, and gas, and telephone.
Cos it's different type of event and music.

No.
No.
No.
No.
Well some of them do, but not, not serious, not serious.
No, I mean.
No we do n't cos we do n't, we do n't promote it you see on a Friday.
So they.
do n't promote cos they.
They pay for the hire, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they spen they spend a lot of money on, on lights and they, I mean they they spend they spend about seven hours in here on a Friday just doing the lights and special effects and.
Yeah.
Well the, the first time they were here when they gon na have the all ni when they were gon na have the all-nighter erm, they hired a laser in it was superb!
But I mean that's that'll cost them five hundred quid alone just for.
Well we.
we ha.
No we have n't.
The.
the the police and the local authorities stop them.
I mean, I have had all-nighters in the past.
but that was for like the school trips so.
you know.
Well.
I know.
I know.
Mad, drugs.
No, no.
You ca n't.
And you ca n't beat the police cos sooner or later they will fight flipping hell to get you.
Do n't know.
Just trying to.
Do n't be sil do n't be silly!
Seven fifty.
Two two pound fifty.

Obnoxious.
Oh yeah, he was legless all night were n't he?
I got him every time, until the end and I said I am not serving him this time!

Cos he was absolutely incapable of talking.

Well you should take his glass and.
Yep.

I wo I would have done tonight those but.
talking to Alan.
Mm.
No I was er talking to, is it Alan?
Security guard.
Well he's better than Stuart!
Well, yeah, but I mean the stories they tell about fishing so they're different stories.
and we caught a.
whereas er.
I have been, I have been in my time!
Coarse fishing though, he was sea fishing, sea fishing.
When are you gon na give up smoking and save some.
money?
You could pay your mortgage on what you smoked!
Did you win any money today?
Have you got my keys?
Ah.
Sorry!
I've got my keys.
Course you can finish your drinks!
I know that.
Well, bring them back!

And bring all the glasses back.
What are?
Oh!
Tonight?
Five bottoms.
Well that's.
half a case.
Yeah.
I mean, not all our customers abs are absolutely stupid.
Buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at two o'clock.
Mm!
I'm amazed they have n't.
Where?
No, no, no, where?
Where are you talking about?
The Empire?
Students, yeah I know.
And erm Mark was in last week he said.
well, Mark said it was, Mark er guessed about four hundred.
He's, he, he went in last week, he went in this week and er.
Yeah.
Ni Nigel mentioned, he told me it was erm er like four, five hundred in tt to.
Well it's very good innit?
I mean, on a Wednesday.
And it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound, pound a pint.
But on the other hand they're making a little bit at a pound a pint.

That's right.
That's getting in the.
I do n't think they've got a lot of staff on.
I would n't have thought they'd bother with a.
student night, having a lot of staff on, it's pointless having ah, I mean, the bouncers in that situation.
Except, mind you, the, the rough, the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er, a rough seeing to.
He had some band that were awful apparently and the.
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their.
fingers up.
No, no, no, no, no.
University rugby club.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The band went ran off in tears apparently.
Could n't cope.
Mm.
No.
No.
The Sugar House only opens er Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
Or, or, o we always have done.
I mean, we we opened originally, first year, every night of the bloody week and it was pointless, absolutely pointless.
Yeah.
Er yeah.
Yes it is.
It's legal, it's legal.
it's it's legally bigger than the Empire but the Empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and.
that.
see.
But, of course, erm for licensing they do n't take that particularly into consideration up there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I think, I, I think the Empire legally is well I thought it was nine hundred.
I ca n't think er I do n't know.
I think it's nine hundred.
I mean you could cer you could.
certainly get seventeen, eighteen hundred in there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Mind you.
They we.
Yeah.
But I mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first.
few months were n't they?
Did n't they?
I mean the Sugar House, his capacity's.
just been upped to eleven hundred I think.
Erm I mean, it was always nine hundred, but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year I think.
Well we used to put, I mean, I put twelve, thirteen hundred in the Sugar House.
But tha but you it's full at that, you know.
Whereas the, the, the, you, you could you could, you could fit sixteen, seventeen hundred.
Yeah, but it was a, it was also a ver it was a bit of a celebrity, I mean it was people, people were crushed around, bloody hell I mean.
all the downstairs, I mean all the plebs were upstairs all the downstairs was erm.
Mm.
I mean, I do n't know I, you see I left I had to come here so I left before Bob Monkhouse and everything, I just, I, all I did was go for couple of free drinks and plate of free food, which, I do n't think I got.
And left.
Yes you would.
You, you betrayed us then, you'd left had n't you?
You'd left me!
You'd fled us!
And gone to work for the opposition.
Just cos you thought you were go.
just cos you, you were coming out with about two hundred and fifty quid a week for working seven nights a week!
I know.
And you were secured were n't you secured there?
Oh!
I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be interesting to see how they they start next week with a a load of er bands on Thursday nights.
I mean, they're all chartsey stuff but.
you know, I, I da that kind of stuff does n't draw punters generally, chart stuff cos the people who go.
the people who are interested.
Well me yeah, maybe.
Maybe some of that will.
Yeah.
But generally pop, poppy type.
Top of the Pops stuff does n't, in the sense that people who like to go and see live music do n't people who like that kind of music prefer the dis prefer it in a.
disco context.
Not, not, seeing sort of a live concert.
Anyway.
Mm.
True.
Well they're not lo all those appearances are P A, it's all gon na be mimed and backing tapes.

Yeah.
Right.

Oh yeah!
That's what we want a.
glass washer.
Yeah, it's quite a good one.

They do say that er, that the er it's.
cos you have to anything on there, food-wise.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who put that in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Doubt.
if it's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Whatever, whatever.
I mean we'll.
be expecting that.
So.
Oh yeah!

Yeah, I know that.
Well when everything's sorted, that's it.
Mm!
Yeah.
Where does this lead to?
Yeah.

Mm.
Right.
Yeah.
Here's the piano.
And these are.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Right.
Was that a competition was it?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Aha.
Mm.
They were all the other pubs and the darts?
A bit of competition from other place.
Oh!
Well it's the stage for it int it?
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Watching that.
Mm.
That's right.
That's right, yeah.
Screen up.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright.

And you do n't see with that.
What's the floor, underneath the floor?
What is.

I mean, closed now, it.
Mm.
was open when Colin was there that time of the day.
You know, you'd have ten, they say.
Yeah.
ten, if there was only ten people in, they'd all be drinking six or seven.
pints.
No.
We'll get them.
I think we'll be able to get them to put them in for us.
No.
Oh we've got ta pay that one have n't we?
To pay that one?
I think so, yeah.
We've got two coming for ourselves, but.
Yeah.
we'll be able to get them off Gary I think, yeah.
And we'll be able to say look, we want, we want how man how many have you got behind there?
Have you got cold shelves behind there?
Right.
So we could get a couple for here.
could n't we?
And you're painting over that.
I've got ta come and paint.
Ah yeah.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Definitely.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And promotions, you know, Malibu promotion night where the.
No.
No I mean, I do n't think.
Well.
Yeah.
I mean, how much do you reckon it'll cost?
If we said ou the carpet, we said well a certain area of the carpet wants.

Erm.
How much did you say.
Yeah, probably.
in all your nightclubs and, what did you say they do a?
We'll nothing, we'll, wo n't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on.
that floor.
No.
Just to, probably, very ends of.
Do n't you, you want your raised area, this.
Er, by, by the bar would you say it no not right in front.
you know, have that.
running to about three foot back.
Yeah that.
Well.
but you do n't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get.
No I'm saying that.
you go right up to the bar.
you want it up to.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Oh yeah.
Filling the smoke.
up.
And all of these air conditioning valves are on?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yo you're light, the er ceiling could you not get away with covering the, get the lights a colour blue?
And er and you know, tidying up ceiling obviously.
I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you need for a.
I mean, if you just cover all the areas that were really.
Yeah.
bad, er I reckon, I says, well what do you think yourself in, in, in.
Mm.
Yeah.
Thousand.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think it's better being like this?
Looking there, or is it better sort of, clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and.
I know it's a fair size, but.
you know.
Yeah.
I mean, if you've got your group on there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on the floor at, at, in front of the group kind of thing like.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
But then if you did this floor space like.
we said.
Oh no.
black, would that look nice?
Black carpet.
Ah, cos Peter was saying, I dunno, I dunno what the black.
Do n't have to be black, you just want, you want something that er I do n't know really, you'd have to think about it would n't you?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
You want the carpet area full of seating.
Actually one thing Barry.
do n't you?
Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right.
down.
the area.
That's one thing Ben said though, which was quite useful, he said get some people down pick their brains.
You know, let them come down and give a quote.
Mm.
for whatever you're looking at.
Mm.
and pick what they thought, was the best thing you could do, and then do n't, do n't tell you but get them made.
Yeah.
You know, and like.
That's right.
I say it, these guys are working on this all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh!
That's right, yeah.
Mm.
Nearly seven or eight year ago were n't.
it?
Yeah, it'll be about eight, eight year ago.
I wonder.
I wonder how ma had to to town, I come down from across the town.

the time after do n't it?
Mm.
Well, I mean, I do n't know how to find the other one out.
You only have to paint the dance floor on then do n't you?
I wonder how much it would cost the town, like?
I know it sounds silly, but I say, the silly things like that are the ones that sometimes are the.
ones that are took seriously.
But like you say, the floor can stand it and there's nice little corner or whatever int there?
I do n't know.
That was rather a cheekiest thing to do.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
they might look er you know they look cheapy or.
sort of.
lino being.
Ah yeah!
I've seen these industrial companies and he said look, have you got any er of your older stuff.
What's that?
Because Polly's got a it was at the front of the bar, it's quite a heavy duty thing int it that?
Mm.
It'll take fag burns and, you want something that's not gon na that's like, that's got li like that crystaley stuff.
Mm.
innit?
And, and it's non-slip.
Mm.
It's a non-slip stuff.
Yeah I know.
I like that.
I wonder if you went to the industrial companies, and said look, have you got a a, a, a big lot of something and.
Yeah, well that'll be alright.
You know.

Yeah.
Course it's still.
Yeah, they do the floor covering.
Yes.
I think we'll just work out.
I've never been to that have you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yo your main job is to see th.

see the bar open and.
Yeah, all that sort of thing.
What's the ladies like?
Mm.
And Jean's corridor.
I resume, see if the places are.
See the crack int bog.
Yeah.
Supposed to lift base.
But er generally needs.
Oh I know.
Aye.
Oh aye.
That's nice, in the toilet.
Yeah, take them in.
That's right mate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've got to be er.
Yeah.
Well what about, what, what who's responsible?
Is it, John is?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it and shut up to there with and that you can.
try them holes.
in there.
with special sealer.
But I mean.
That's right.
That's what I mean, and we'll be alright.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Put these under there.
Mind you if you do that your only problem then is your roof int you?
You just.
You just put a lick of paint again, wo your tiling's awful int it?
But.
Yeah.
It's all there.
Yeah.
I mean, damage is being done, say you have got seven guys there stood, what's.
the other one doing, I think can, can pull.
this off.
So they've nothing better to do.
You got them on trough, then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else.
Then the longer you got them in here they're likely.
to.
Oh aye.

Well they probably thought you wrote it.
Looks like they're not getting on.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah!
For putting it.
It could be a.
out.
That's right.
Six is it?
Oh.
Yeah.
That's right.
And how much of this stuff's down?
I mean, this'll have been down I, oh, wo n't be able to get as much wear.
Did you lay that yourself?
A little bit.
Do they just seem to stick on tap or is it a row?
A row.
Yeah.
The stuff that's that's the stuff you want.
This is, it is not the similar stuff like we've got in the kitchen upstairs?
No.
No.
It is er, it's er.
a actually it is like that stuff.
But it's different.
It was n't here was it?
Same.
No.
sort of thing.
No.
Maybe that's the type of thing you want on the floor.
I reckon that is.
That is it.
Up here.
Oh aye.
Yeah.
I think it's better up there.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.

And practical really, is n't it?
As I say, people are n't going in in there to look at, oh! what a pretty carpet you've got.
Oh no!
As long as it's, as long as it, it's warm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
No, that's right, you know, the, the, the only thing we've, we've actually gon na trying to get that into a the bar is er segregate.

Mm.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
Well that's, well that's what not ba bad is it for those int.
Mm.
it?
Mm.
That's alright int it?
Oh to but that will fit is a bit.
bit more thickness than I hoped, er but if it's sat on top of there and on top of what's on.
I do n't know whether they were actually sitting right where the bevel or whatever.
I know this sort of stuff is we had similar to when I worked in the shop er, used to, he had three quarters of this, guy come round in a van or whatever, back of a van.
and he laid it himself.
and by the entrance and whatever er.
I think you'd have to get a professional carpet.
So.
layer just, just to make certain.
Summat like that really, is, is obviously.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
No I can did you have a cloakroom then?
Or did you.
Mm.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Next door.
What you did n't do it?
That's Breakers in there is it?
Is this an entrance as well?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see that there.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen that, yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
What about there?
Mm.
Er.
This is for changing rooms?
So this is a.
there casual act.
Sort of.
Yeah.
I mean, it's a got extra padding on.
Found the place.
Oh!
Ton Peter?
Did he?
Yeah.
They say there's.
Cos Caesars are in there now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'll be getting what is it in, they ca n't open now they've lost the er, they've lost some of er, they've lost some sort of.
Yeah I know, but it's, it's, it's summat.
Aye.
So the easiest thing really is obviously is if I get the thing sorted out and then, turn it.
around and er we've had a word with Elliel this morning.
Mm.
Erm they they're quite happy with with all that sort of stuff.
Yeah.
They're gon na come up are you free on Fri Thursday afternoon at four o'clock?
But I, th th they're actually supposed to get Friday rush.
and then you really should with the staff we've.
got.
So.
, cos unless we're going to get it straight, but it just all comes in like this time of year, and just comes and let us in.
I mean.
If we got here, if we got if we got to fa wherever you wanted to meet, where do you want to meet?
Come down to us.
Well if you come down to us so.
Yeah.
If you bring him down about.
you know, half four to five.
we'll be.
You'll get the idea.
we'll be getting on top.
then, you know.
We're usually done by five, you know, so there's.
no problem.
Make by five.
o'clock.
Five o'clock.
I think the biggest thing really is just like they say, is how much you can get that done for and, get the roofing done, that's got ta be done.
Er.
some paper them toilets cos er, I'm, you know, I say, from our our, both side is something that's er I mean, everybody's looking purely from and return sales.
All you're looking at is for an income, an income from it and er I reckon can do very well.
What do you, what you think of that bar area Barry?
Do you think it could be inclined to be.
Er, the top one?
as a drinking area.
U yeah, I mean I.
during the day?
yeah, well it was it was what I wanted to, it was what I wanted to, it was wanted to do initially, I mean, but then you have like so many ideas that.
Yeah.
you know, you ca n't do them all in that sense, but if you had somebody somebody like Colin might be able to.
And five, ten of them.
And they'll all, they'll all be drinkers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
As you said, they have n't actually, you know, it'd be if you could get some sort of portable.
screen that'd just shut it off.
So people do n't feel as though they're sat in a wide ai wide open.
you know.
Erm.
You can get, you can do something.
ca n't you?
Like you say, if you get your satellite T V in there.
you know, you can.
just make it a cosy little bar where you can.
It wo n't cost any to give it a go would it?
No.
If Colin's if Colin's up for it, it would n't at all.
I mean, it needs to perhaps perhaps they can do something for the first couple.
Oh yeah, need some sort of er.
Yeah.
idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you you put your beer on at, well I just thought of couple Boddingtons put their they're they're gon na put their, they're gon na put there's at a pound a pint.
You know, just to attract some people, you know, approach the brewery, say look what about a few keg?
And if you get two or three keg put that money into free stock you know.
Say you.
If you open it up, if you do get it open, and advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint, get them straight to come in.
You're not making a fortune at first, but once you get it going.
Mm.
The only other thing is the.
Depends where your money is really.

Whe whe where's your cellar?
Yeah, but if, if you.
How big's your fire exit, entrance?
the fire exit.
You could put it behind, you could feed it through the wall behind to where that.
spacious room is where all your chairs are could n't you?
how would you get in there?

Well, it's got, it's a bit dry this.
You can still.
Erm cos you'd tell the brewery would n't you?
The only other thing to do is, is do what er er, we did at one time and just get a bright beer and open it up and er, and then pull it.
And have it.

I know.
Now there's a thought.
But would you?
But I wan na do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster do n't they?
That's that er that's a traditional beer innit?
they got ta but he's knocking it straight.
down are n't they?
It's just getting it up here.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, very strong lad this.
You might have to do it later.
Yeah, course you can.
I was gon na.
It's in here.
suggest that.
Up here and then get.
Oh, oh that's my order for Thursday.
Have you got line cleaner?
Yeah?
Yeah?
That's put a.
The bar, the bar, on the bar.
The bar's there, I mean I was thinking you had your stool, painted that white on.
Yeah.
or a red a deep.
Oh yeah.
sort of red behind the bar, maybe get a couple more like that.
Oh yeah.
And then we'll fill the shelves up.
That's right.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Well I could.
El e Elliel, Elliel said that er they could probably twist the council's arm.
What's that for Barry?

Yes.
Yeah.
How much is that for?
Twenty two.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean, some of it is is the next two month anyway erm.
but.
Oh and the other the other thing is, is, is by asking Fred for.
To pay.
That's right.
Yeah.
I mean.
we've not gone any further with this Fre with Fred because.
No.
we're just leaving it so we sort ourselves out first on, on how.
Yes.
we feel happy with it and.
Yeah.
and whe how, how, whether you want Fred involved in, in what way.
Yeah.
And.
Mm.
Yeah, you could work it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
Oh, I've got the.
accounts in various off-shore islands and, and.
black bin liners in his back garden.
If he can o if we can offset, if we can use all, if he'll out time type of thing.
Mm.
with that.
Yeah.
erm the oh er.
And then you can do it without Fred and, really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could pro proof pay load could go back to yourself and I, I E and ourselves, but by having him that other cut you're gon na be saying well it's all a bit more than your share.
I mean, from my point of view I do n't think he's ever.
I do n't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return.
Not in the shor.
I'd be quite happy to come.
not in the short term.
Not in the short term.
you get tucked into it, and obviously there we'll keep it sort of low profile.
But giving it a good clean out and getting.
Mm.
it dus painted behind the things whatever, come on Sunday or whatever and just say that you might.
In return, yeah.
Just take a.
quite keen just to sort of get.
Mm.
mucked into it.
Mm.
just to save money.
but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from my point er is not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going.
No.
And use the fifteen grand to its best image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club so it can get people in.
Mm.
And we can get the lighting in.
Because that's what your best thing is.
Mm.
you've got the ideas and th the motions.
Mm.
And for yourself, and what we do n't wan na do is like I say, is spend money that is just gon na disappear and say shit!
We have n't really improved the pub's barrelage if goes away.
No.
I mean, th the other aspect of the, of the fif the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that I was talking about, er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with you know, okay those, th those figures are I mean, unless they're really realistic it's gon na be you know, six months or so.
before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a you know.
a profit each week.
a a, a, reasonably substantial profit, I mean.
so, with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's so we need a little of breathing space.
Yeah.
on that six months.
Now er, er obviously if, if we can, if we can get the money off the brewery cos you know, if we can get a little bit more.
That's right, yes.
than we actually need to spend that that.
Yeah.
enables us to you know, have that breathing space erm so we can start.
Well what, what we can, you know I say, he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can, mind you.
Yeah.
I do n't know if we can squeeze any more or what.
but, but, you know if say well look, you know, we could do with twenty five and he turns round and he might say well you know, yo he might say no.
Mm.
but we know we've got fifteen just to get us.
Yeah.
going.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What he said then is look, you know hey he's, all you're saying really.
is ah, if your barrelage is there then what we do is buy five or six barrels from Morecambe Bay Wines.
Yeah.
You can say Morecambe Bay Wines and buy all his.
Mm.
cos what I, I just said to him I said look, I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us.
Says well we'll get it delivered here you know, only without.
Yeah well that's.
invoice.
That's what we wanted innit?
Well what we do, what we use.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Barrel or keg.
I'd like you to just purely myself, I'm not saying I'm right and you're not right and people like.
Mm.
my o my own personal view is if we just pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend but not to sort of say, well you can spend it and update it ca n't you?
But spend what we feel is gon na make the club.
Mm.
better image like you say.
Mm.
somebody comes to look at it just for a view I mean, I say, I, I'm quite happy coming like I said th if you motion behind there, make the bar presentable we'll fill it out with stock then that'll look better.
Yeah.
but if we do display.
we've got a load.
of tent cards and display things.
Yeah.
that could decorate that.
Yeah.
You know, and we'll do it ourselves, I say I mean, what you want Barry is like wan na keep it low profile.
Mm.
But we've both got time to sort, I say, somebody, we'd enjoy doing it.
Because we, we, we either do it ourselves and spend.
Before the cricket season.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I mean, America are getting a private cup for here.
I mean, if you just emulsion.
Yeah.
that, the red bits, into red and got the, so I say, nice sort of tent cards and and got a few firms, I mean firms and come on in and do your display you know.
Yeah.
and your promotions and.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean things like what I want on desperately quickly is Rebel Yell cos they're spending a fortune in the rock, well all our punters all know it.
I mean you go down in London it's the it's just like Rebel Yell everywhere, but it's all heavy rock so.
I mean it's just perfect for that, but I know they do a display unit and things like.
Yeah.
that.
But I mean, I have to go.
Well that's all it wants.
through, I have to go through Michelin to get that.
Yeah well we'll, you wo n't know, you'll be.

No, no, I'll be.
We.
You could of told me Tracey's on.
Yeah, that bitch!
He said.
It was er one bottle free, buy two and get a bottle free and, plus display unit you see.
Yeah.
and I said well I want it on but he said you'll have to go for this.
Oh course.
Said alright, so I filled out a bloody form and I went to Michelins, they knew nothing about it and they had n't got it displayed either!
And this was like three weeks later, it was n't.
Mm.
you know cos I said.
Oh yeah.
I wanted to begin with that week.
But that mean, I mean that's.
Yeah.
examples handfuls of it, you know.
Oh yes, you could pay for that.
Mhm mm.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
Do all wine coolers.
Yeah.
as well do n't.
Yeah.
they?
Do n't do a lot of wine you know.
Yeah.
Well true.
That's kind of true, yeah.
I mean, we went through we went through nearly a case of one point fives at Mary's party.
Leibfraumilch.
I mean, it, we had.
I mean I reckon.
we had to.
or do you want to.
Yeah.
how do you functions.
Nine, eight er nine er one point fives.
Yeah I know.
Get a few Pils ' cabinets.
off them.
It's, it's great!
The staff ca n't wander off you see on a night.
Ca n't sneak off at back cos they.
Oh yeah.
move!
I know.
They're stood here like this!
Yeah.
I mean, other thing we really need to all, er you see, when I was working at it, and when we were doing it all the time.
er you were using your own contacts.
like.
you know mate of mine had got his son at bloody public and wants one of these posh public school type all night parties, so we had one of those, and, you know and er.
I say, like I say I just just red er paint summat like, these are white these and just go down on the red and just up there and just up here, just get your displays.
Yeah.
and your bar'll look ten times better.
I tell, I mean ju okay, forgetting the carpet at the moment it's, it'll cost, it'll cost about a grand to get the toilets all done up.
three hundred quid for satellite in erm I need these shutters repairing cos they're.
knackered!
And, and odds.
and sods and I, I, I'd like to buy a couple of lighting effects, but I mean.
you're only talking about a co you know, a few hundred quid for that.
Let's just choose, I know you ca n't change.
what the there.
No you ca n't.
Yeah.
just er.
the basis of this fifteen grand, is using the fifteen grand but like we can see you using that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But we ca n't.
it.
Colin's awa I think he's, he's taking kids away for camping and things all next week but I'll, I'll try.
You need.
I can say to him that about it.
yo for a start you need those two, th these end two you need bli you need blinds on because you ca n't utilize the screen in the summer without these I mean we got, we got blinds for all those windows, I mean.
Mm.
they're all, all they are are they're pho photographic you know, when you have blackouts and er, you know the.
Yeah.
they're that kind of mat.
white material, they're just white, but they, they a total black out which they use on the rave nights.
I mean, I do I, think the view is quite nice certainly if you got a summer it's.
quite a pleasant evening.
See, my idea originally was that cos it comes back from when I used to go in the in the Blue Anchor in Lancaster after work I mean we had everybody in there!
We had like market traders in there managers of Marks and Spencers and Woolies.
and, you know, building societies, insurance companies, and everybody's i the rounds were like twenty five quid a time, but everybody's only drinking halves cos you could never.
you know, so just half a gui but it, it got that, but once they changed the opening hours do you remember when they brought in six.
o'clock?
It destroyed all that.
And then er, they brought it back and then they started doing to quarter to six, but it still was n't good enough cos you ca n't, you ca n't have all these people in suits and briefcases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting for it open, you know.
I mean it was n't good.
for their image.
So.
So it like killed that.
But I'm sure there's, I'm sure there's that kind of trade for, you know, a sort of a Bic Biro runner type, you know, that kind of well our age group, you know.
the sort of.
thirty to, thirty to.
fifty age group.
And, and people want a drink after work and have a chat, cos the.
it was a it was all business people and you're talking about.
you know what it was like, what things were and.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got them into this place.
I mean the wine bar.
in Lancaster did that happy hour did n't they?
And that got.
heaving.
with business people.
I bet that would be really interesting.
Yeah.
Elliel's our discount because you know they're doing.
It was great!
I mean the biggest thing really I think my interest in all this to get secure trade from us.
Mm.
which we're gon na get and get your salary.
You know, because they're the few main things round here, you're happy, and you can feel that obviously you, you'll be working for something.
Yeah.
I mean, to be honest I've put in like two, two years without any.
salary with this place.
I mean I've been doing outside jobs to get, you know, I mean, like doing festivals.

and whatever else to get.
Yeah.
my money in.
So the.
Has an anybody come to you through the.
and, you're losing money,, if you're not, if you're not seeing any return you're.
you're going through the motions.
I mean, God, you know if I've got ta go down to London for three days I'd rather do that cos it's gon na earn me two or three grand.
Well we could set, like you say and no you know, and get it going and you make a salary.

Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll get it to the.
Well you'll get it, you'll get it from the turnover wo n't you?
And also, I mean, if we turn over hundred thousand pound with you in a year you're gon na make some money out of that.
That's right.
Yeah.
You know, so it's.
Yeah.
er.
Make a grand or summat out of that wo n't you?
If you're lucky.


Yeah, I'm not too bothered about that.
But if it's, if it can be dropped at your place.
Because I mean er you can always say look, I've got commitments all over the place and actually be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
with you, you've got ta get the rest of the stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See.
Well that.
Yeah.
But also.
Good.
it also means we have n't got any, that's an area where we have n't got any repayments.
Yeah okay.
Do you wan na.
play with those figures again?
Dunno.
Before we get started doing it.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
gon na have a look round the back is he?
Yeah.
I'm just, I mean I reckon you could, I dunno if you can just pull them in.
Draw them up and we used to do the would be quicker.
Oh ta.
you're gon na be really talking about next week are n't you?
It looks like it.
Yeah if you can.
Definitely.
See not that easy.

You mean, it's a fire exit so that's the problem so you're not gon na be able to leave anything in it that would obstruct.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
It goes out next to the cellar.
Oh er, if you put, if you put if you put wrought iron gates gates decorated type of thing round there.
and then somebody stands there, two fifty that's what I were thinking, an admission from here.
And, and wrought iron it, yeah, you know.
Well wrought iron'd look it'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get.
Yeah.
the artificial plants up it.
and whatever else.
when you do.
Get climbing plants.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that, that would do double job cos that would do the job of your blinds as well would n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Get your wrought, your gates there, or something like that to be.
Yeah.
round the back, which entrance would they come in?
They would n't come in that end.
Well I mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I I think you just have to but.
You'd have to play it by ear I think.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's.
As you say, if somebody's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven.
or twelve, then fine, let them.
I mean I th I would n't, I would n't mind that.
you know, I mean.
So you could either come in half eight, half nine or.
That's right.
You know.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, I mean, what you, what you'd have to be careful of is, is sooner or later people'll catch on to.
Yeah.
coming in at quarter past nine.
buying one extra drink and erm getting a you know cheaper than saving theirselves two and a half quid then.
pint they buy, and if they buy five pints.
Yeah!
they can have a three, er er a three pound voucher.

We're getting complicated are n't we?

Complicating issues.
I remember at the Uni when we used to give we used to put stamps on people, you know,.
for pass outs and that or anything.
and er I bloody, I said, I said in the end I've, what we ought to do is lop some part of their anatomy off, like a little digit or something then we can prove they've been in.
eventually, after about two years when you get this sort of armless, legless cor.
body oh he's a good customer!
We'll let him in for free!
He gets a free, free ticket!
Well it's like, like a all you want to do is.
Yeah, th the trouble is you're.
you.
you, you're doing it in the same room.
are n't you?
That's the.
But I I dunno, I see it's not once you're u actually up here, looking I think it's different when you're up here looking back as when you're over there looking up here.
Yeah.
It's not quite as cold and empty as.
Yeah, yeah, you want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think so.
I think you do I think that would look good anyway and.
and it would also enable you to quickly and easily do something on the erm on the, on the private functions night to make it look different.
Mm.
I mean, I would n't suggest putting.

plants up and everything for our normal you know, rock nights, I mean we just have the wrought iron up and whatever, but.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean, those are just we just went out and chucked a few fucking trees down.
No, the trees are the er things tied on to them are n't.
But er.
I mean, that'll cover.
Yeah.
if you did that in quite a few places.
Yeah.
throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes.
Ye.
and your, your.
I mean, what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this whole area in, in greenery and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type.
I mean, again, it's ideas when you're sat.
It's ideas.
planning, before you've actually moved in and get.
It is.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
and get and then, then you start.
that's, that's the other thing when there's only two of you involved and you, we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months five, six days a week just keeping on top of a day to day business does n't allow you to sit back.
and expand it, and whereas, you know, that, that's one area that'd be great with having yo your involvement.
that you go in and say well you know.
It sounds like this sort of thing.
Yeah.
It was when I was working for Walt Disney, so it'll be two years ago.
Two years.
ago.
I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green.
It was alri it's, it's actually lasted reasonably well considering it had n't been.
for two years.
But again, it was all done, it was all literally done in a weekend.
Yeah.
It was like a virtually an all night blitz job and so bits of it, you know, it was n't like, totally completed, you know, you've got and as Scouse was doing some of it it was er the paintwork leaves something to be desired in areas.
Just coming down a little bit.
They just need brushing back up.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
The heating's very efficient as well.
It's very hot gas heating.
Yes.
Erm.
They did do it, like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now and then use.
Mm.
you build up, up and up do n't you?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, we can, we can start by we I mean we can get people set up for doing things from the first of March ca n't we?
Yeah.
The little bits and pieces that we talked about.
Well we, well we, we can start if you wan na start with the.
Or we can think about doing something about.
this.
We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wan na start giving it a lick of paint.
You see, now the more you think about it, I mean the more you you do n't actually use this.
very much.
I mean, you look at it, if everybody was seated in this area that could be seated I mean, you're only talking about bloody.
I.
thirty people.
I do n't think it's too bad actually.
I do n't think the carpet's too bad at all really.
Well th there's areas, I mean.
Yeah.
tha the licens.
Oh yeah.
the licensing people would pull us up on that.
Yeah.
if they came.
That's what I mean, you got ta and then do it, clear it, and then clear all that.
Mm.
and just left that area.
and they're obviously, they're gon na say.
Yeah.
I mean th th er, the other thing psychologically is it's, you know.
Blue Rhapsody.
Blue Rhapsody.
If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you've got a problem.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Right.
Mm.
I reckon the first thing really is, is get your salary.
Mm.
Get your salary, that you feel that I'm doing this and I'm getting it right.
Mm.
Is that the right sort of, if our I mean from our objective is to get more sales.
Yeah.
right now.
That's right.
That's right.
And we've got ta.
That's right.
manipulate people to say well, how do we get them drink more?
And you say like five pound a head when they they come in.
Sit there till.
It's, it's, if, it needs doing.
You know.
If you've got a guy gathered, I'm not saying try but if you got somebody who, who did the job and gathered it in like they would do.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it i.
An upholster.
It's a perpetual patching up job at the moment.
Because, because it is only patched up, it's.
Yeah.
it create more problems o you know cos people stand on it and.
Get an upholsterer just to come and tidy it up.
Yeah.
and fill in where there's been.
Yeah.
some damage done.
Yeah, that's right.
I mean there's.
Just, just tart it up really.
There's a bit of structural damage to the support.
Yeah.
and things like that, that start the seating going and things.
Oh this this actual stuff anyway we'll go, we're putting that with that is alright to that.
Oh yes.
the back's have been.
Yeah.
alright.
Oh yeah.
There's a few of them damaged but, but erm I think we've repaired most of them.
You see, we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in, cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter!
Cos Peter had this place.
Yeah.
That's right.
We knew.
about that.
How?
Did he.
owe you money?
Well.
Did you!
God!
You must be one of the few people.
He was called, what was he called?
Ken?
No, no.
No, that's.
that's John.
But what do you call him?
That erm.
I know who you mean, I met him, yeah.
Cos the other guy was a, was a bar manager Duncan or.
Mm.
Der summat like that, and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine's so she our midwife would come and er, so the she kept in touch really of of what they were because they wanted to, I'll take the place off, they wanted to take it over.
I do n't think they was er as bad a.
No.
shower of shit.
No.
as he were.
No.
tended to.
No.
be.
But er, in the end they never got the license back.
Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club did n't they?
Top of Lancasters.
Next to the.
Cos the.
Alex.
The Alex.
They tried to get behind there, the catholic.
Yeah.
club.
Right.
Then they got, they did n't get it past.
Mm.
But er he actually owed.
Yeah, that used to be.
about five grand at one stage and got it down to three and half, and then he got to six hundred and eighty and they went to court.
and then they got.
Paid it through the court.
Well that was remarkably.
lucky.
He did n't half go for a lot again.
Yeah.
But I, I, I'm amazed that breweries keep lending him money!
I know.
I mean, it's unbelievable, you know th er, he's done so many breweries and yet why they do n't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another.
He do n't give a toss.
Mm.
As long as he's got an installation going in and if it.
Yeah.
if it gets written off or.
or someone has to take a, a bi a co company has to take a big lot off.
It's par for the course really.
Mm.
Well, you know.
Dreadful innit?
Well he's got that much money to burn Barry that's what it is.
Mm.
Yeah.
I think it's your, that's your T V thing is it?
Yeah.
T V, video projection.
How do you work that thing?
How do you work that thing?
From behind there.
And where's it come there?
That one.
That just puts on.
At the moment we use.
Yeah.
I mean, Mark's got some great stuff of the sixties er er er, ex, ex movies of the so er trailers of ex movies, you know.
sizzling, sexual and all these sort of and, wha what was really outrageous in the sixties looks so tame, but.
it's on in black and white and fifties, it looks quite good fun.
It's.
I mean when we get, when.
when you get tho when you get the half the er when you get sort of well like the scooterist dos and th the DJs bring it up, I mean they bring in a hard core.
You'll have to try and change the old fash.
and things.
And and and quite amazing.
watching Jean.
picking up.
bottles on the night and bonking going on!
Was Alistair ringing you yesterday?
Mick who?.
Mm.
Yeah.
Harvey.
Yeah.
I had n't thought of that.
Doubt it.
It's Saturday it was it's not bloody arrangement.
Yeah.
That's right.
It's broken.
Mm.
Looks like, looks like sawing off and redoing.
it.
That's enough.
Mm.
No.
Oh no!
Obviously.
Mm.
Yeah.
Anything in it?
Have you seen it?
You know like you being all pathetic.
Yeah.
Well that's right.
I mean I do n't know Dave's just not That's stupid!
Why make any comment whatsoever?
Mm.
Well it's a.
enough of these ad pamphlets.
Guilt?

No.
What was this big presentation yesterday?
The tourist notices buffets.
Mm?
Thrown out of their offices.
Champagne and caviar job.
No, no, no, they were going to present him wi for something.
Something to do with hoteliers or summat.
Probably needed a map to get here did he?
I've read it.
I've just seen to it that.
Er, in Blackpool?
How long's the conferences?
Two days?
Three days?
Erm I mean I do n't know, whether.
you're still interested in, I do n't know whether you're still interested in speaking but erm, we've just been approached by the A N C, they're pulling everybody back, there's, everybody's going home.
Cos, the repatriation what they call, the United Nations start.
But, he did get a special price?
Say what can I get them for then?
Say, bugger all!
Where is it??
I know.
Yeah.
Right.
Erm, they're thirty a time.
those are n't they?
Cos he, he changed the whole pad you know.
Yeah, yeah.
No that's alright.
Yeah.
No that's okay, just leave it at that.
Well have n't you got a problem if there's no hotels available?
Well you can always commute.
Is there no hotels I mean, just along that Preston Road?
Mind you, you're not gon na get a delegate rate from them are you?
You're no the further we, you go away, the further you go away from Blackpool but it's not at.
delegate's rate.
Are they delegates all the time conference?

giving a giving it a a service?
Yes.
That plastic cupboard for the keyboards that.
No, no.
The.
the other one.
Yeah, that's right.
You know what you have to do?
Oh right!
Oh yes, that's right yeah.
Sorry!
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
It came off at one stage.
They were n't using it, so.
put it back on and.
keep it on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah!
You found one of those.
Yeah.
especially blackcurrant and orange.
revolting!
That was lucky!

Mm.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well is a en suite.
I do n't think it is gon na be en suite.
Well they said, the number of rooms did n't it?
Did n't say all rooms.
And if you've got the last three I ca n't believe that the last three are en suite.
That's what I thought!
I stayed at the Claremont when I was down doing and I ca n't remember where it is on the street.
John was.
John but mind you, John has been insistent on it, he.
moved a whole delegation if it were n't en suite.
Oh yeah.
Of course.
I mean he's at the age of being incontinent int he?
John unwashed and unshaved on the front delegate, on the front.
Yeah.
I'd er ring up just in case cos you might have to solve your problem.
Better to knowing now than to know when you arrive there.
Have they mended your photocopier yet?
I might do.
I need to get hold of Mayfair as well cos there's cigarettes out so.
Phew!
Yeah.
It would be a couple of days.
I want Mayfair as well.
I want Mayfair to come.
Fill it up.
It's empty, so Mayfair fills it up.
What's it called Mains?
Mains, Mains, Mains, Mains.
Oh!
They have been getting Ma Macs first do n't they?
For some unknown reason!.
You tell me why they has Mac before Mains.
Mm.
L M, Main.
H, I, J, K.
How many nights are you there, two?
You ca n't, ca n't.
remember what it's called?
Well you probably, I mean you, you as, you as well, so I mean, you probably wo n't.
be able to get there till this evening and you probably wo n't be able to see him will you?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh, this big international financier!
You're gon na be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and Yorkshire in Brussels are n't you?
Steak and kidney pie!
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
No.
No.
Sergio's going to erm erm one, some Cubs visit to London at er half term.
Yeah, but the.
And er, so she said she, she wants to take the last couple of days away.
so she's, her aunty's going to Dublin, so I got these things and they were really cheap actually.
There's the train fare from here to Holyhead return, the ferry, transfers to their hotel the best hotel in Dublin, The Burlington.
is absolutely stupendous!
Two nights bed and breakfast, full Irish breakfast, which means you wo n't need to eat until the evening!
Erm train, free bus passes round Dublin, includes their bus fares and, and train on those sort of metro type thing.
they have in Dublin all for eighty five quid!
I know.
The only problem is, that the hotel that Mary's like, ah!
This looks beautiful.
Cos I, I, that second hotel, hotel, the only thing, is the Burlington.
And I dare n't, I'm not gon na tell her, but I, I, I'm trying to say, well, it's a little bit out, it's in a park and er, th th but it looks gorgeous!
I said, yeah I know.
And it was, where they had their honeymoon.
So I'm going, oh no!
Not for just er Siobhan, and sister-in-law, erm is the head of Town and Travel and, Manchester.
Town and Travel, and she got the presidential suite at the Burlington which is like a, you know, I mean, erm, it's absolutely gorgeous!
And it was, it was about two hundred pounds a night and got it for ten pounds a night.
That was about, well, ten years ago, when well well it's really appropriate.
So I think, well this is a, this is actually on O'Connell Street, that's right in the centre.
But I mean, that's actually th th one, one of the, that was the, the, the other ones like four star hotels were on O'Connell Street which actually opens only seventy seven quid.
That's including all that travel and.
and I mean, it's incredible though!
And it's something like twenty quid for an extra night if you want to stay, the problem is the Holyhead ferries, they're dreadful!
You know.
one gets you in at seven fifteen which means you're only really getting one day.
you know, for that price, cos.
by the time you got in, checked in, got into the hotel, it's gon na be nine o'clock.
You've missed the day, and, you've got Saturday then, th ferry back is ten o'clock on the Mo or whatever day, but the ferry back is at ten o'clock in the morning so you've got to leave at eight o'clock.
I mean, really, you've got to book an extra night to be honest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
I mean if the fe if the ferries were like early sort of bo got you in at lunch time.
then that would be alright.
And, and, that you could get say.
get say a late afternoon one back.
Cos it's, and it's only about two and half.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos it's part of the, that's why it's so cheap.
We need to phone Mayfair.
I'll do it, it's alright.
It's been an awful long time for this part has n't it?
I mean, it's been a month.
Just shows the state of British industry.
And the recession.
Oh!
That carpet's got ta be done ai n't it?
That carpet cleaner's coming.
Yeah, but we need a new poster though.
gave us a poster.
Alright?
One to come.
We need the sa spare part, when I, I mean we need the sort of anyway, what was.
happening do n't we?
And it's, and we also need to see them mend it properly.
I ca n't, I ca n't say.
I do n't know.
And you could do that in the all the rest area, you could do it in the whole club to be honest.
Mm.
Well, I was saying that yesterday to them.
I said.
Yeah, cos I mean, I were saying that yesterday, that, that little bit of damaged carpet in there because it's a carpet.
you've really got ta replace the whole bloody carpet have n't you?
But yo you know, if you, you got the tile situation you just.
take a tile off and replace that.
I think we ought to sort of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er, well the bulk, the main floor lino, but the two raised areas and stairs in.
Sa a.
Yeah.
Well phone Meg,.
Tomorrow afternoon.
Say, three o'clock?
We well, yeah.
I mean, and you here, I want you here tomorrow too.
Which, which number of theirs?
Er er well it just says Lunar Mills or after sa after hours sales office.

Yep!
That's it, forty three.
Yeah, we got one actually.
Are we okay for till rolls?
Yeah?
I have n't.
Yeah.
I said to him on erm su er sa Saturday night.
Oh well, he said to me on Saturday he said do it Thursday after.
I say, so I said, well I'll arrange for a delivery.
But, having said that he's not the most reliable person in the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Co yeah we are.
Yeah.
I mean, I can be back for well I mean, I can actually stay there in fact.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
What the hell are they doing now!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well certainly some people want some answers want to be given on this budget, er me as well, I mean, he ca n't just suddenly say.
it's all been sorted out, do n't worry about it.
And how long?
Well I park.
er.
Nope.
I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at with ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha.
You know, I just do n't understand what they're playing but th you know.
they can only be doing damage to th to the election chances I mean.
they ca n't be achieving anything else!
Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group innit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's, may as well.
Well, do n't know.
Well it does n't really matter, I'll, I'll be I mean, what, so I mean there's except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there?
Well I ca n't put it away.
Do n't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery comes.
No you wo n't cos I'm meeting Ellial at, at half three.
Mm.
Well he's not gon na want to, he's not, sha I mean he's it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really?
Which which tickets are you talking about?
Where?
From where?
Oh yeah.
No.
Well it's it's a trial.
Go in then.
No there's nothing.
Okay.
Alright.
That's a master key for those.
Well I put that blue thing and it's fallen down.
Yeah.
And I say, Bernie's room.
See if there's any rubbish er are those, are those worth keeping those?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I thought, there's about three or four towels and few.
That's no good is it?
The what?
What doors?
Is that a door?
Yeah, in there as well.
We'll stick that stick that in.
Wan na stick that in or not?
Well that's a fire door is it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Er.
No, I mean, I saw.
You know I did n't watch.
Mm.
I, I actually taped it and I was, I was watching a bit this morning before Jean came.
Ah?
No, that's a trestle table.
Yeah.
Cos I, I wan na take those mikes out and take them.

There's a lot of rubbish in here int there?
Well stinks of it!
I mean, this is the.
Did n't she?
Well nothi well we're not anyway because we're not do using those lights any more so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, basically you wan na be quite ruthless and just get rid of.
everything that's going to be dumped, and we're not gon na use again.
Yeah.
Er and the same out the bottom office.
Erm just get rid of everything, I mean, how many of these fluorescent tubes are used up?
I would n't have thought so.
I mean why would any.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
Repair some of the er the framework.
Erm.
Yeah.
We got plenty of those.
That's er had it.
We, have we got a mop behind the bar?
Yeah.
Erm well I would.
Yeah.
Well we need this bar floor mopped anyway do n't we?
It's sticky so I'll er, I'll leave it here at the moment.
Er, no we got it read yesterday, and, and zeroed up, so Jean got the till roll, I'll have a, I'll erm.
I've got to look at it today, I meant to have a look.
Er, I'll er I'll do that later on.
Right, what wha what we're doing, we've got erm.
Yeah.
We're gon na have to walk some of this down are n't we?
Erm.
Well we're not, taken all the rubbish.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's just that lot we sent down now, and er.
Er we took it er.
Monday, Monday or Tuesday.
Monday.
What are they?
Oh!
They're over there.
I'll move that one we're gon na.
we're gon na Americanize the club.
I'm gon na turn it into a ma an er American theme, like, you know a Harley Davidson bits of bike on th th on the walls and guitars and.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About fifteen grand at the moment.
from one brewery.
Well, no non, unsecured loan written off against barrelage.
But, but.
what we've, what we've done is the said job where, where.
Erm Whitbreads.
Erm.
Well, yeah, from Whitbread.
No that's right.
I'll go into Wilsons for another fifteen.
And put Budweiser on draught.
Boddingtons.
Yeah.
Boddingtons they do.
Oh!
Wilsons do.
bitter, yeah.
Erm.
Wilsons, Samuel, Sam Smith's erm it's, it's th you know, it's they've all brought each other up now so they can virtually get anything.
But I'm, I'm re I'm, what I'm after is Budweiser on draught more than anything else.
I'm gon na have Budweiser, J D you know, go.
through the, yeah, I'm gon na.
the thing is, you see, if we do it an American flavour I mean, people expect heavy rock music in an.
American bar do n't they?
I mean, you expect to be going in and listening to Bon Jovi and, and Free, and you know in the background do n't you?
Yeah.
Well I mean.
Yeah.
Well that's, well, well, well, we're thinking of opening.
yeah, we're gon na open as a pub during the summer erm.
No, we'll keep those for su you never know.
So we have and erm we're gon na open up the top bar, top bar and ripping up the carpet.
in the main room, and lino in the main floor right, in, in sort of.
probably blue.
Yeah.
And redoing the stage floor.
And I'm carpeting I think I'll carpet tile.
Not that much, cos we're getting the lino off Pete you see, and get the discount off to do the, just for the lino.
and then make it.
Yeah.
Ex-husband, yeah.
Erm, and having a carpet tile because we can then do it red, white, and, not white, but red and blue you know.
And, if you.
damage a tile, then you're only replacing a tile.
And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino floor.
So then, then it, allows to dance as well, and basically hardly anybody sits in that area until the club's full anyway.
so that they all go in the.
Erm, going to somehow, at the moment we're thinking of well Jean'll wan na do it, but I'm I'm thinking of doing some kind of I mean, we're agreed on what we're gon na do, but it's how we do it, I want some ka er, some kind of grilling around the top, the cocktail bar area, so you can open it as a, as a bar, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself, so we open that as a pub type of thing, you know.
Leave the big screen on and that and we can put erm and get, you know, as I say, if you.
you get, see if we can get hold of like, I mean you wo n't be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like gold dust, but you might be able to get hold of parts, you see.
If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow.
effect of a Wurli I mean, that's the beauty about it you, you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson, but you might get hold of a petrol cap.
You know, or things.
like that, you know.
and you just bang those around the place.
Er, a few handlebars and whatever else and, but, but but do n't do it like the British bikers, do it like an American bar, so it can be cleaned and.
I mean it can look nice and.
sparkling and fiftiesey, and lots of pictures and.
No, that's right, yeah.
That's right.
You see, and then if, if, if, if, if sort of people are, you know, holiday makers come in, and it's an American theme, they expect it.
As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gon na come as a shock to them.
You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think.
And, and it wo n't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead of green, you'll paint that red and you've got the white pick out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet.
I do n't know.
I think we'll have to, I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.
And I'm gon na do er, you know, lots of promotions and stuff promotions on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We well what I think I'm gon na do is next Thur not this Thursday, we'll just have to live through this Thursday, but next Thursday, erm I'm gon na get get Stella back on, and I'm just gon na sell it as cost, whatever it is, sixty P a pint or whatever.
Yeah.
I mean, cos at the end of the day if you've got the, if you've got, if you can get er sixty people.
two fifty to come in, I do n't mind if I'm giving the booze away!
And er, as long you got the.
Well it does n't matter does it?
You know cos that's the only way we're gon na build Thursdays up.
No.
Je Jean's is it?
Right.
Get rid of it.
Jean's doing tonight.
Jean's doing tonight, and I'm doing Friday and Saturday.
So er.
She's away.
Yeah.
Er but, you know, I, I'd, as I say, I think er and then if we just, if we can just pick up like the odd I mean, I've, I've had a long chat with Anne, we've had a long, erm meeting with Anne yesterday about it, and she's gon na start pushing cos you know, she's really done the Royal upstairs, it's.
a really beautiful room, but it only holds about forty, fifty people, what she's gon na do is push the weddings, but she's gon na, and say look, you can use this place.
For any, any, anything bigger, you know, you've got.
you've got forty people, you want somewhere bigger, then fine.
Cos er, Mark last week said er, he'd been approached by a wedding to do a disco, he said well I ca n't it's a Saturday, and then he said well, you know, where are you having the reception, said well we're looking round at the moment.
Well ca n't, he said look have a word, and he said to me, you know, do you mind if we do like eight till eleven o'clock as a wedding party.
and then we just do the disco afterwards.
That's right.
So we just get them in, we open up our doors at ten o'clock.
And I mean, I wan na change the ten o'clock opening, it's bloody silly is that!
That's just bloody ridiculous that!
I mean, we may as well come in at twenty to ten, and, and have twenty minutes of you know because, nine thirty you know.
The only people you get in before nine thirty do n't drink anyway do they?
Just.
They did last when did they come in last week?
Is it Thursday they came in?
Yeah, they came in really early about four of them did n't they?
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
That's right.
Er, no I'll leave them.
Leave that, but er.
What?
Yeah, well you'll have to leave it anyway.
It's the wrong size actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then, and then you can shall I get a oh that's the other thing, I'm gon na get the toilets redone.
I'm getting the toilets.
What are they?
Oh, those.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh.
What I'm gon na do is get the toilets, I'm gon na get the toilets, the gents toilets, all the urinals ripped out and getting it troughed all the way around.
that L though and that's why.
I know.
We well we did, we looked at it when we first opened but it was like another grand to do that.
Yeah.
Nine hundred quid to just, just for the troughing.
No.
That's right.
That's right.
Well you pa yeah you certainly pay nine hundred pound a year out anyway, damage to the toilet seat and so you know, that'll pay itself back in a year and, you know.
And also, it's just the hassle.
And there's, er, I mean it was showing somebody round the other day and we were talking about it and, and erm they're saying, yeah I mean, you've got seven urinals there, so let's say you have a busy night, you're full, I mean that's when damage gets done when people.
are sat around waiting.
you know, and they're and sat on sinks and whatever else, so you know, you could, you could get twenty guys on that urinal that you can get for seven.
Erm well I'm obviously going on yeah, let's just I was saying just dump it all.
And er ah these.
Right, I've just got ta phone Alan upstairs so.
a couple of things.
He's looking at doing a me he's doing a menu of stuff for us so er will that go in, that'll go in the lift wo n't it?
Yeah it will.
Poor old Ossie Ardilles, eh?
Poor old Ossie Ardilles!
Bloody great innit?
You know, I mean.
Yeah.
I know.
I mean you'd really, you really need that do n't you?
Hey!
It's getting a bit wild in Belfast.
A bit wild in Belfast innit?
Yeah.
Well the last three days innit?
I mean it's just.
Yeah.

I know.
No.
Well no, I mean, a tha even tha that one the other day with the eight workers I mean it.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah I know.
Yeah.
I mean they do n't ask your religion when they go.
into action do they?
But er I mean, it must be wild.
Yeah.
I know.
Hey!
They're opening and Belfast ferry again.
Passenger.
This summer.
This summer.
It's er it's a long one.
sa I do n't know.
I I'm.
Ten hours, they've got it averaged at ten hours.
It's a long time.
It's two o'clock sailing so you get in at midnight.
So like.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It's gon na be a proper ferry.
It's gon na be a proper passenger car ferry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was about eight hours.
But it's a car one.
Erm i but surely it's a, i it's an awkward in a sense it's two o it's great, it's alright this end it's two o'clock sailing from here, but I mean that means.
No.
Two in the afternoon.
That means you're getting in.
that means you're getting in at midnight into.
Belfast, which is.
a bit of a pain.
Well it's not it really depends on how far away you are.
But I mean, you know but o okay you've got.
another two or three hours on a journey.
No.
Well you've got another two or three hours on the journey, but having said tha well if you get picked up at the other end it's not too bad.
Two or three hours on the journey, but on, having said that you got in time for the train fare, the and the.
dis I mean, it's a bloody long time that train innit?
Or else if you're driving up to Stranraer it's a, it's a good three and half hours ' drive plus your petrol.
Yeah.
Well that's right.
Well I've never had to do that.
I've normally caught a train that's gone thro straight through, there used to wo I do n't know whether there still is but there always used to be one.
But even so, I mean I took a, like a two or three year old on it and I mean it is it's a nightmare!
You know, you ca n't amuse them at that ta er can you?
You know, they wan na not for that, that you know, a couple of hours you keep a kid amused by well a.
you know after that they.
they wan na run around.
Yeah.
So er that's it.
So I mean you'll be there wo n't you?
Got er I just picked up er Mary once going to Dublin.
Ser Sergio's in erm London at half term with the Cubs for about four days, I said do you fancy a sort of two or three day break, said one of these short breaks?
She said I'm off to Dublin.
So I do n't think really, really train from Morecambe to Holyhead return.
Lancaster, Morecambe to Holyhead return Holyhead to Dub Dublin, the ferry.
Right.
return.
Yeah.
Two nights bed and breakfast in the Burlington, or one of the other four star ones.
I mean, they're good quality.
We've been in the Burlington years ago and it was like.
like hundred quid a night ten.
years ago.
Erm transfer from the ferry to the hotel and back again free bus tickets, free rail tickets in, in Dublin area.
Yeah.
Right.
Eighty seven quid.
No.
Good that innit?
Cos a full Irish hotel breakfast, you do n't need lunch do you?
You know.
No.
Oh no they're, no they're, they're in the brochure.
brochure.
Yeah.
Very good that.
And if you want to stay an extra day it's about twenty quid extra.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you just so, to get, actually you do need to stay the extra day cos it, cos th the sailings from Holyhead and get, yeah.
the sailings from Holyhead get you in at seven.
Yeah.
That's right.
Hundred, hundr hundred and seven quid for erm and you get a complete Saturday and Sunday then.
So you arrive Friday night at night, seven thirty so by the time you got your hotel and checked in, da da da, it's nine o'clock at night.
Well if you did i if you only did the two nights you'd be co and the sailing is on.
the sailing's first thing on.
That's right.
Well you have n't even got that cos the sailing's ten o'clock on the Sunday morning.
So you've only really got Saturday so, if you took the extra night, and then you've got a ten o'clock sailing Mon you're back in Lancaster.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Not in a, not in a prop you know a bed and breakfast in a.
four star hotel.
I mean they're good hotels those.
Cos as I say, I stayed in the Burlington.
I'm trying to talk Mary out of Burlington that's all cos that's where I had my honeymoon.
She does n't she does n't I ha you know I, I.
I said well she said, it looks lovely this.
I said, well it is, yes, I mean.
this is a really, this is more central, cos there's one on O'Connell Street you know, so you're right in the middle then.
are n't you?
I mean the Burlington's a little bit out.
So then she said.
go up to the Currane.
I'm going, oh God!
That's where I got marri married.
Well I.
Yeah.
I got married in Newbridge just a a little village on the Currane.
So er.
Yeah, sure.
Yep.
Good.
It is a great price innit?
If you, i i they, they got the brochures in A T Mays.
Yeah.
Er you know.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well er, there's erm.
Oh I know.
Well, there's, there's er there's one that Mary's lad took his girlfriend on, er two nights London Hilton and train fare thirty nine quid.
London Hilton!
No so no I think it, no sorry, sorry, not it's not, it's two days one night.
Sorry, it's one night.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
Oh yeah.
I mean, but your train fare alone will cost you, it'll cost you thirty quid.
Yeah.
You know when we, we, when we first opened from a dead start right?
The first fifty five weeks which is.
a year we did na on the bar did ninety thousand quid.
The next five months less than half a year af the next five months after that right?
Yeah.
Well, yeah, when whe er er a after that first year the next five months seventy nine thousand!
In five months.
So if we'd have carried on at that.
Yeah.
I mean tha th we, it, have been.
Well I think we'd have gone to two hundred thousand.
But that, at the end of that period was when Volks recalled the loan.
And.
Yeah.
But er, but when.
Yeah.
But when Volks recalled the loan we sort of give up.
I, we went two day week opening and not publicizing it, everything.
So if we'd have just carried on the way that was going, I mean, that got it from ninety thousand in just over a year to, to seventy nine thousand in five months.
Know what I mean, like we did n't want.
Well.
I think.
Yeah.
Right.
Looks like a motorbike handlebars you can stick it on the wall.
No, bung it.
Whoops.
Over there.
What on earth's that?
Right.
Er.
No.
Yeah.
I mean I'm, yeah you know, we're just gon na make a fresh start in here, we've zeroed all the tills for last week and everything so Jim's er, that's locked.
Erm.
Er, yeah alright.
That one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They can go as well.
We've got enough mop heads brush heads rather, we just have n't got any, not connected to the brushes.
Will that go in the bin?
We might as well carry it down.
Well.
no, just make, I'll just make a way through that's all I want.
Can you sort of give it a sweep?
Is Anne putting those out?
Putting those out?
Oh was there?
I was trying to kill the then?
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying we've still got that massive box of keys that goes in there.
that we had from the day we opened and we've never found them!
Yeah.
And we've never found where they're fitted.
Er may as well.
Mind you, I do n't know we got oh yeah keep it I suppose.
Might just miss it.
Want it mopped over in the morning.
What's that?
What's that?
They're teddy bears by the looks of it.
Flame retardant oh!
They're, they're the seats.
They're all the seats.
probably use that for.
I think you've destroyed it now have n't you?
What's this bit?
Yeah, if we give this a sweep out and that.
And hoo hoover that little area there where all that, I tipped.
all that rubbish because it's I mean the hoover's.
knackered anyway.
It needs.
Yeah.
For what?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, good idea.
Probably get, less chance of getting broken out there.
What's happened?
That, over there.
Have we got any screwdrivers around?
Not much good.
I suppose we could put that door back on again inside.
Oh wait!
I'm gon na fix that, no do I'll, yeah I'll bring some from home cos I wan I wan na nip home for er an hour and I'll er I've just seen Anne.
Erm American stuff for.
Yeah.
I'm gon na do like chillies and whatever, you know.
She, she can re do them and we just have, microwave them when, as and when.
I need somebody in to do that.
Ye oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos.
Cos even.
even ri I mean rice does really well in a microwave.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
I've just snapped the screwdriver!
No.
No, it's a my word!
Shit!
Why is it cleaner's rooms always end up like this?
Yeah.
See this was, this was the dance floor before.
er, where it follows this line.
And it was a sort of funny shaped thing.
Yeah.
Just to here.
And it was like, nothing, so we just extended all this out and made it into a stage come, a bigger dance floor cos the I do n't know why they wa always seem to have this trends that, they have these trends in the seventies and that was, and eighties of having small dance floors.
Right, that's and the disco console was open to the public so the public could just wander in and tap the D J on the back and tu change his records for him or whatever.
It's a stupid opera so we've fenced that in.
Erm but this is the area up here Anne, that I was sort of thinking that we could if we can, some kind of trellis or something around this raised area here you could actually open this bit as the, as a pub on a.
as a sort of pub, you know, on a Saturday and Sunday in the season.
Food and that.
You know, and with a big screen you can have like sport or Grandstand or.
ro music videos or whatever you wan na do.
Get satellite in and get M T V on.
Mind you, the satellite's gon na cost three hundred quid!
Roughly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, change all the, paint o pa paint all the, change all the green to sort of red.
Yeah.
Red, and then you got the white pick out.
and you got the blue seats, so you've got red, white and blue have n't you?
Yeah.
Oh no.
Nothing was cheap, I mean.
the seats are good, you know, these tables are bloody heavy!
And they've done a you know, they did a good job when they built it.
Erm I mean, you can see what he, what he intended doing was the plans were beautiful!
This was gon na be there's a piano there on that.
raised area there, so this was like a piano bar.
there was gon na be a big fountain in the middle there.
this was n't gon na be disco.
a big fountain in the middle there.
and an orange grow.
type affect, it was gon na be called the ora this was the blue one, so that was the orange.
purple, whatever.
The bar was a double-sided open.
Yeah.
And the other side.
which was gon na be a big glassed disco.
in there, and that was gon na be the disco, and this was the, you know, I mean it was a good idea, I do n't know why he pulled out with went half-cock.
Erm you know.
These are the things we were talking about yesterday these uprights.
I mean they just.
open for.
Yeah.
I mean they're very sort of vandal easy or whatever.
Vandal a fa er vandal friendly hooligan friendly are n't they?
Whatever!
You know, I mean we just got them cheap erm lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.
Yeah.
No you do n't.
That's right.
See, if you sort of somehow trellis that area, that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to.
sit in here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you got, you know, if you got a character behind the bar could er attract people by his own force of personality.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.
Cos I would n't lo I mean I actually do n't think you can do, if you're gon na do people are gon na eat I th I think you're gon na be pushed at more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred.
You know, depends on how you retail it first but.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, it depends a as you say, er yeah I mean it does depend that.
Cos if, if you, if you, if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor area tables and things, you know.
If you had that kind of function that you you know.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah it does.
No.
No.
What we did do.
very well.
erm we were we some of the jazz stuff, I mean.
it it, it never worked in a sense that it was n't commercially viable.
but things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had.
and we had like the ta trestle tables in all these alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal.
and, and, you had a meal and sat and watched the band and everything.
It wor i I mean for those it did work.
it did work.
But.
you can see everywhere.
And it did.
Yeah.
Mm.
Have you actually ever seen round this place properly?
No.
No, you ca n't that's one of the do you wan na sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a.
quick look in there.
Get your bearings.
It actually looks bigger looking that way than it does when you're up there looking back, I think.
Erm I'm thinking of atmosphere.
But if we if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos you can.
you can dance.
Well you get.
No.
Well i it's been down since it opened so that's.
got ta be eight or nine years.
It's done well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No you ca n't, no.
Like, so it's sort of self-contained in one.
sense.
Er.
And.
When Trish had a do in here, her fortieth she let.
er Trish had her fortieth birthday here.
She laid there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here really.
Erm.
Yeah.
She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end here.
But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we ca n't really we built that wall here and it's just a this is the back of the disco.
I mean al it's all, none of it's sort of.
determined walls, I mean, it's no no wall there at all.
I mean we put this up just.
to break that.
because this is the console bar.
It's for it's for the cellar, yeah.
Well it's not, I mean.
Not bad.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have, but er.
Fine.
Yeah.
Yeah, you do, yeah.
Yeah.
We've got erm somewhere, a pizza oven.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you wo n't need to do that now.
It's somewhere anyway, we've got.
pizza oven.
Ice making machine.
Glass washer, yeah.
We've got er.
No.
There's not.
No.
So basically they've got ta just tray it up.
tray it up here and then.
bang it straight in.
Erm.
Yeah.
We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff ca n't run away!
Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well you see, hardly anybody ever sa they do n't really sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit.
right at the end of the, you know.
when it's full they'll sit on those two tables.
Yeah.
I mean, everybody round here just stands or sits on those bar stools.
When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down.
O.
or they stand at the bar.
It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's only about half a dozen tables.
Which is, you know, at maximum you're gon na get twenty four people sat around there anyway.
So I think, in a way, it's erm a bit wasted carpeting it all.
Cos it's a big area.
to carpet.
I mean the quotes we had ranged from sort of.
eighteen to twenty seven.
Well yeah, and.
and it's getting past it to be honest.
I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license, they were n't gon na give us it because the carpet was lifting.
So I mean, not, were n't gon na give us it, but we had to do it for.
you know, at the time.
And you can see like like there can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.
There's one there.
I mean.
if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're you're stuck are n't you?
You know.
you've either got I mean, we've either got ta put a table on top of it or.
Yeah.

Erm or replace the whole damn carpet.
I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune!
Mm.
But it it's not a bad size room in the sense that.
in the sense that you can get three hundred in.
well we often get four hundred in if you're you know, I mean, just have the right.
party erm.
Three hundred.
But, you can get but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well.
You know, it.
Yeah.
No that's right.
That's right.
I mean.
that's the Carlton's problem innit?
You know, if it, unless it gets.
unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn aircraft hanger.
Mm.
Yeah.
It does.
It does, yeah.
So you would n't have to spend a fortune on, on, on I mean it's only a matter of most of it's a matter of paint, and then hanging a few things up is n't it?
Change the atmosphere.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
True.
Well there is no benefit.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it?
Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms?
Right.
Not Chelstons, right.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
No, that's very true.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Well you can do what, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Well.
You ca you're gon na, you're gon na cover it, I mean we've got to re.
we've got to re-cover that.
stage anyway.
So.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs.
All you do is just put them round there.
I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House.
they've got er actual flat floors.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you wan na sit in there rather than.
Oh.
Mm.

Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need a little, you could always bring a little stage in.
No.
No.
I mean.
I should think so.
They cost us a fortune!
Mm.
Mm.
Well I've, yo you need to redo the, the fixed seating.
I mean, some of it o you'll get away with, but generally you re you need to recover it, it's going all over the place and it.
Mm.
Yes, but it's dirt on it.
The trouble with the American red, it's a, it's, it's not a maroon it's a.
bright pillar box type.
red innit?
You know it's.
So if anybody, if anybody spills anything on it or whatever.
it's gon na show like a.
Mm.
But I thi.
Mm.
Well it's.
Yeah.
Alright.
I mean, if you've got a function you have n't got that much of bar trade.
in the sense that.
being busy have you?
You know.
Oh yeah.
No, I think you'd leave the D J's.
Oh yeah, well Jean keeps buying.
Jean keeps, Jean keeps buying these this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere!
Look at that!
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well on that you could do something stars and stripesey all round there could n't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Right.
Oh yes, I've heard of that.
Well Co, Miller and Bud are all American beer.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, the other thing on, on American of course, is you can do all that Cajun stuff ca n't you?
And New Orleans area, you know.
Oh.
Yeah.
No.
No.
True.
Yeah I mean this looks almost like a school but I mean.
Well nowadays, nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway do n't.
they?
I mean it's not like.
it used to be a.
everybody wanted warm.
Mm.
Yeah, I thi yeah I think you're right actually.
You need to get rid of that and it's and create a dance floor.
what, and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in.
no, those spots around.
there shining on the.
floor, put some round the back so.
you actually just use.
see, but I er, I think creative use of spotlights is better than, than specialized lighting effects, which A, cost a fortune, but B.
as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.
Cos they're only effective one time, that's the first time you see them.
After that, it's.
No.
No.
So erm I mean you can just use coloured spots it in, I mean, those at the moment are just literally stage spots, all they are i are on, and on dim.
then you can dim them up or whatever.
but they ca n't flash.
so what we need is a small unit in there and, and, I mean, it's only two or three hundred quid er, and a few erm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, marvellous!
Yeah it would, actually, thinking about it.
Yeah.
Yeah, course.
Yeah, I mean i it's keep on walking round till you get familiar with it.
In.
in there is staff toilets and your spirit store.
Food store in here.
And it's locked.
Cellar?
Down below the bottom.
Yeah.
It's a pain in the neck!
But it's er.
But, now, Volks actually looked at erm buildi putting a lift in and building a lift to it.
I mean but okay, well all it means is, you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty twos not elevens.
I mean.
And thirty sixes that's right.
But er we've got three stand up freezers and the.
In the chest freezer.
Chest those are, those are freezers.
That's.
that's a chest freezer.
So you got three standing, one chest, and a fridge.
Yeah.
That's the lift down into the cellar.
Yeah, it takes erm you can get half a dozen crates in you could get eleven gallon if you wanted.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
National Scutters.
That's er, from a rally.
Association of Rallies.
See the but er, this room drives me up the wall!
I mean I.
This is back of the stage.
This is the back this is, the D J is here.
Yes.
This is just a back wall that is.
Give it a bit more room.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah..
Yeah, could but.
Or you can do all these round here.
And you could have this for your preparation area if you want.
I do n't smoke.
Yeah, it's a big.
Mm.
I mean at the moment all the food is is protecting the license cos you've got to do food, food up to two o'clock.
You've got to have food available.
So I mean, we're just going through the motions at the moment, I mean, quite hone.
Yeah.
But I mean quite honestly we have n't.
No.
Mm.
Well that's where, I mean, you can make money on the food sometimes ca n't you?
And that's, that's where you've got.
No, no.
I mean, de a I, I think he does n't do a bad job on to be fair.
I mean he does the big functions and he does n't do a bad job.
he's better than he was a few years ago and.
and, and.
he's.
I tell you what amazes me, Mary, he takes, he can take a conference, when they have a big do he puts them there for the, you know for their dinner or whatever they.
got there.
And, he's, she s keeps on at him all the time, he's never taken a photograph of the place laid out for a big dinner.
So she keeps sort of saying well of course, er, you're taking an organizer round the disco are n't you?
You're like, you know, he's stood in the disco and you go to him.
well it's all laid.
out.
They've got ta imagine it, you ought to have like a pull.
a photograph and say oomph!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Again, this is look it's the same as this.
Shit!
That's the fire escape down to outside.
No you ca n't, no you ca n't, no.
But that's that area we were looking at.
Either side of the disco console.
That's the passageway we just walked down.
And that's the area you were banging.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah!
It's actually you know, if you took the time you make a tremendous, it'd make a tremendous big area would n't it?
No messing!
Yeah.
God knows what they'll get up to!

Yeah.
I, I think I ca I, once upon a time I did on the fixed seating for, for I think you could get about a hundred and twenty round.
there.
Yeah.
As it is.
But you see the other thing, the other thing that er that's worth, when you've had the smaller dos, you know.
sort of even, even like sixty, eighty people you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area.
which kills a lot.
of space in the club.
The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive empty space, if you have got.
sixty, seventy people you have to then.
Well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then you go back and sit up there.
Yeah.
Mm.
We got a lot, we got a, quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually.
surround the dance floors.
but we.
push, you know, push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway.
Mm.
Mm.
That's right.
Mm.
Mm.
We could use that chrome railing around.
area.
Mm.
Mm.
Now, wha what I was just thinking of.
is it, if you, if you're using, if you're gon na use it as a pub as well.
on a Saturday and a Sunday.
which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer season if you Americanize it and all that and, and just, well I mean, we, we did.
Yeah.
That's right.
Then, you know you wan na start from that and build back out bits.
you know.
cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar hundred and twenty people.
Well that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
No we have that closed and.
and try and sort.
of shutter it off in some.
way.
I mean maybe.
maybe even getting literally shutters rather than those grills.
And then you can.
I tell you what we had Laura, Jean's daughter had erm a nurses ' dinner here it was about, the they wanted to come on a, on a disco night but.
they wanted a meal beforehand.
so we did like a meal for, I think there was about thirty of them.
and we put them onto that area.
and er and I said to Laura, ah I know, I'll put so I'll, I'll, I'll put something on the big screen so you know, some videos whatever.
I said, ooh!
I'll tell you what, I've got Live Aid all taped on you know, from years ago.
so she said oh that'll be good!
So I put Live Aid on.
Course, I'm sat in the office like this, and they're all sitting down to their lovely fo five course meal and of course great!
First couple of bands on, then it stops and shows about quarter of an hour starving kids!
And I went, I went oh no!
I had to leave.
it off.
Yeah.
Or T V.
You can have, you can have normal T V on there.
or video.
Erm.
It all comes from, yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's controlled ba back in there, that's where.
it's connected from.
And you can actually see it from everywhere in the club except for that corner there.
No, I have n't been in there.
I mi ha I'll, I'll, you ought to go in.
Yeah.
Yeah, I must, I must have been, I have n't, no I have n't been.
I mean, I've been in there when it unless he's drastically altered it.
it only used to hold about a hundred people.
It was only licensed for a hundred people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do n't know what he's done inside, but yeah I like that.
I'm not sure.
Yeah.
Mi I'm not sure.
That's right.
Is he?
Is it this week?
I knew he was getting it.
No he's just come back from Tunisia on holiday so he'll need it.
Stupid he is!
No.
Having said that I, you know, I mean, i i i exc i if he's not gon na do that.
or even if he, even if he is doing that he's not gon na, he's not gon na.
do it very well.
Erm.
Carlton is far too big for the Abbey!
I mean, like our cricket club dinner, I mean we have it's usually between sort of eighty, and a hundred and twenty people, but.
I mean we must, they must spend twenty quid a head at the bar.
at least.
Yeah.
But we, but we go to the Carlton, well so.
I've been to.
I mean, we've been all round but the last three years we've stayed at Carlton.
I said, he's done a pretty good job.
But there's no reason why you do n't do you know.
Yeah.
Well the other thing that's really good is, cos you've all got that set up cos it is a disco.
you do n't have to upset people.
and.
bring gear in while they're eating and be setting.
up and.
testing the equipment and all that sort of stuff.
The D J.
plays background music while you're eating.
and then winds it up when you.
when you want, you know.
Mm.
Well these damn, these bloody tiles cost a fortune!
They say just I mean we, yo th there's bits and pieces of like you know.
like you have to redo some of tiles but a lot of them.
And even things like the cocktail side I mean, although you never use it, it's a bit of a joke, I mean it actually fits into American bit dunnit?
Oh I know you could, yeah.
Mm.
Whitecross?
Oh!
Oh, oh is it?
He's opened one in London at Heathrow Airport.
Is there?
Well that's.
That's the problem innit?
I mean, one, yo yo be you get good because of the reputation of doing something and, and the one person.
doing it and then because you're good everybody comes and you cease to do it, you're upstairs doing the books instead.
and you employ staff.
Ah.
No, but you know what I mean, I mean you get.
pulled away from the.
actual.
what you're good at.
onto other staff.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
Is it?
I know.
Yeah.
Hugh do you know Anne?
Anne.
Hughey.

Anne's just saying we erm ought to pull that whole sta dance floor out and have it all flat floored.
And you could then do something that's.
Yeah.
And, I mean you can create a dance floor by the tables and just lighting round it.
I mean that's all it, as I say, I do n't know why I did n't think of it cos in the she well I do know why I did n't think of.
Like the Alamo you mean?
The thing blows out of it?
Arrows stuck in it!
Are we erm.
No, no.
Yeah I know.
But as I say, if you took that out you create a massive empty space then.
then you can.
And then just lino the whole floor.
No.
No.
No.
I mean lin.
I me.
for the sake of, for the sake of a few bands that we do, I mean most of the bands on the local level are used to playing in pubs so they just had to play on the floor anyway and the rest of it.
And any, any major names you could always, if you need, if it was that big yo and important.
No, but.
No but I mean you could get a a stage in.
stage in from across the er across the way.
Just temporary.
staging that's put in and cast away.
Yeah.
I know!
Well, you know, once he, once he's once he's resigned himself to not getting this back.
No.
Not now, no not.
now, not Elliel.
Da I mean once he sort of re I mean that's why all the fuss with Jean stopped because that.
But once he's, once he's resigned himself to that, he's then got ta look at that operation next door and he must be losing money hand over fist for the amount of space it is.
He to take out all these walls out, right the way back.
and it's as big as this.
Back to that wall.
I mean it's a co it's almost a bloody conference centre to be honest!
You could, you could seat if you did, sort of classroom seating in there a, room this size in that, er, you could, you could probably seat six hundred people.
Not as many as the Dome.
Even, at six hundred.
Yeah.
I mean it's a Dome and a bit.
Oh did you?
Mention it.
Yeah, well, the tro he sa.
It's the lighting is n't it?
Need to get a whole batch of these ti.
we need to get a whole batch of these tiles get them all sorted out.
These tiles.
Cos they're.
multi.
Oh are you?
Hi.
Well we er.
And read their lips.

Erm, no we need, we need to get a whole load of ne er tiles cos the whole club wants re-tiling, not re-tiling but there's a whole area, areas and that.
And and, they're the wrong, you know, if you're gon na, if you're gon na redecorate the whole thing you need to erm you need to, you know.
You do n't need.
three diff four different kinds of blue in the roof and things like that.
Hughey does them, I do n't know.
How do you do them?
A man's only as good as the.
tools he's given.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I quite like that idea with them all like that.
Yeah.
Hello!
Yeah.
No, not yet, yeah.
Okay.
Oh right.
That's right.
Yes it is, three thirty.
Okay.
It's just a matter of er, i I mean all we need to do is, is, is sort out a sort of formal agreement with Elliel that, you know, and how, how the management company or the limited company's going to sort of manage the place and th then we'll er got to, you know, we've got two people who've got a, a very successful business they're actually drinks ' suppliers, Morecambe Bay Wines and Spirits er, who are gon na come in and have er they'll sign the cheque for the rent there and then, I mean it's er it's a matter of just th you know, all it is is, is they're saying well, you know what actually is the formal arrangement?
And we're sort of saying, we have n't actually got round to formalizing it yet.
Er Mm.
Right.
Right.
Yes.
Yeah.
Erm er, well Jean's got the exact figures, er, she's, she's done it all, she's got it all, all down for, for, for this afternoon.
Erm, I do n't know, I've written it down.
And th on the cherish you and whatever else and th erm, I mean we've already got a situation where we've got erm through Peter and David, the other two, I mean we've got erm erm two or three breweries who are quite willing to erm to give us quite a substantial amount of money not as loans, as write-offs against barrelage erm which means that we do n't have any repayments to make etcetera.
So they're effectively sort of grants and ye in, in that way.
Erm mm, no, you just play it, yo well, you he yes and no, I mean i er you, you, you were ge you were getting in pra i the equivalent of thirty pound a barrel discount erm, which is probably as much as you could er could get, er in, in in a free free house any, er except that you've got, you know, fifteen, twenty thousand pounds up front as a payment to you.
Erm the company is Morecambe Bay Wines and Spirits.
Erm and this is going to sound stupid but I do n't know their second names.
Peter and David are the two erm they're up to yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Erm it's just to two of them and er.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ve er, yeah, I mean it's, it's.
expensive, it is very expensive.
Mm.
It's just, just a little, a little sort of parquet.
flooring type of thing.
Yeah.
But it's only a tiny area.
is n't it?
But as I say, in the Sugar House so we I mean, we've ju we, all we did was, was we the mass the big central area we just literally sort of lino type floor and carpeted round the edges.
and into the bar area.
And it's a ma I mean you get four hundred people on the dance floor in the Sugar House.
Erm.
It's in erm.
behind Waring and Gillow.
Up, up the alleyway by the Yorkshire, you got Yorkshire House there.
Waring and Gillow, and it's up that alleyway there.
It's, it was the architects ' department erm, till they go like you know, till they Palatine Hall erm, it used to be the architects ' department.
We bought it off the city, well Michelin bought it off the city council and they gazumped us and erm but we, we have tables and chairs onto the dance floor on other nights and just pull them back when it's clear.
Saturday night there's gon na.
be a thousand people in.
That's how we used to do it.
So er can they get, yeah, they get eleven, twelve.
Er I think they le it's nine hundred.
is n't it?
Is the like, legal limit.
They've, they put like twelve, thirteen.
they've put twelve, thirteen hundred in.
But, when, when they can but you've ju i in the Empire if you, if you've I do n't know actually, i before they before they messed about with all the raised seating and everything, if it had been just left open like the Old Floral Hall, like it was you'd have got seventeen.
eighteen hundred in.
With a balcony.
Erm I mean as an ol as the Old Floral Hall they must have had.
they must have been putting two thousand in you know.
in those days.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I mean, they'll all be packed up in the bars upstairs would n't they, and everything.
you know, leaning over the balcony and all that sort of er.
But I'd er, I'd you know the way they've, the way they've got it now I do n't, I do n't know.
But, you know i I mean actually the other, the other aspect of it Anne if you, if you pull this out you could be talking about hosting small conferences and that.
could n't you?
Cos if you're looking at a two hundred capacity conference for er.
You.
probably need to.
get.
probably need to get Ken's per.
probably need to get Ken's permission!
Mr.
Structural alterations.
Mind you, act actually.

Actually th from the original structure, I mean, it's, it's, it was half that size anyway.
Well as I say, you can see where it was, it's that sort of diamond.
I think.
No.
I would n't.
Well he wo n't know I do n't I do n't think he dare show.
his face at moment, he had n't been anywhere round to, since all this happened before Christmas.
Yeah.
What, and that in there?
There's a massive room with twelve snooker, twelve snooker tables.
in.
It is the size.
of this.
It is the size of this, yeah.
Yeah.
And what they've, what they've got, they've got the bar in a far bottom corner.
I did.
Disco nights.
When we have a when we were talking to them and we had the door through and my snooker got really good.

Oh.
Mm.
What?
When you were at?
Yeah.
Might do in a minute.
Oh alright.
Okay.
Said a Ranch House from.

That's who we need to advise us do n't we?
We need Geoffrey along to advise us.
Geoffrey, how would you.
how do you Americanize this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Criticizing a scooterist.
Criticizing a scooterist do n't want them in town and then put functions on and cheap beer for them when they come.
We need lo we needs lots of piles of steaming horse manure and things do n't we around and.
stuff like that?
Got ta get it right.
Yeah definite.
That's right.
Yeah.
Cheers.
Eh!
Have you seen the new rules on er bar staff?
They're not allowed to smoke.
No, no, no.
Anywhere.
Not, you ca n't even wander outside.
That's right.
And, you've got ta wear gloves to use the till.
You ca n't ha you ca n't handle money and.
pull pints.
This is Health and Environment, it's a new.
Er er, I do n't know actually.
I've got it in Disco Club Mirror, it's the front page out the.
Grantham.
They're treating ba.
they're treating alcohol as food.
So all the hygiene things on food apply to alcohol.
So you ca n't handle, you ca n't handle.

Well you.
Yeah, you know like.
you know like it is.

Or nuclear license opens.
Mind you, one.
Vo Volks Volks took them.
Volks took them into, not Volks, er what they called?
Somebody took me to see one of their pubs in Liverpool it was wonderful!
Where the shutters are.
all, just hardboard like that, with just a little O like that and you, you, you shout a pint of beer and you pushed your money through and then a beer ca came out the other side!
It was rough!
Yeah!
It was a bit of a rough area.
No, and a pint of sherry!
Yeah!
Great!
I mean, the only way you could do that would be if you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and exchanged.
it for drink.
That's the only way you could actually make that work at all.
Ah!
It'd be unbelievable!
Yeah, but it's somebody sitting in an office innit deciding this!
Sitting in a suit in a nice office saying, wo!
This is a good idea.
You know they do n't serve behind the bar on a Saturday night.
Yeah.
What?
Actually tomorrow night's not a good id well.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean it's all light and smoke and all the tables and chairs are out and.
And you wo n't be able to see anything.
Yeah.
Erm I mean Saturday night would be be better Anne.
Bye.
There's another there's a orifice down there.
I know.
I know.
That's er, that's our.
Yeah.
That's ours as well there.
That's ours as well down there.
Yeah.
It's er cleaner's room, two dressing rooms and toilets down there.
Well this is the area that you'll have to do something about is the if you're gon na knock it into the Winter Gardens this is the area that knocks into the Winter Gardens.
Well, along that corridor is.
Mm.
I mean, what, what we initially, this was a cloakroom this, this area.
was n't here, i this.
was the door and there was a little cloakroom.
but er, our customers do n't take their jackets off anyway.
Erm.
No.
But more in, but what it was we when I was in here, sort of five days a week, nine to five job.
it was getting depres it was getting oppressive in that little office down there.
So we were gon na move an office up to here with some natural light in it.
Cos there's nothing worse than there being a room with no natural light in, really.
I did n't realize it at the time but I think it wants.
Yeah.
So.
It's oppressive.
Course, the other thing you've got ta invest in is tables and well you do n't need chairs, but tables, I mean as you can see we've got two hundred of those poly-cotton chairs in there which is erm can be used.
Mm.
Tables are quite expensive though.
Well, true.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
I tell you what make i trestle tables are so expensive are n't they?
Incredible price!
You ca n't, you ca n't get either, you know, proper.
you know, big wooden.
trestle tables you just ca n't get anywhere.
There's another wasted area.
There's incredible wasted areas in this place!
Terrible innit?
Mm.
It's all foyers and things.
Alright.
Speak to you later.
Cheers.
Bye!
Great!
What is it?
I know.
What's on it?
What?
No.
The erm you know that bottle of bleach in the cellar was it bleach?
Did n't smell very strong the top's been off it.
I just brought it up with some er, just in case cos we do n't, we do n't really wan na use that for like these.
Er I've taken all the rubbish down except for that long box in.
Yeah.
About forty quid's worth of empty cases.
Yeah.
I know.
Have you been to put a bet on?
I guessed.
What on one race or.
Well they said about, what?
Who?
Elliel?
Half past three.
Yeah.
She said sh sh sh she said she'd be here about half two.
She's been to a funeral.
I do n't know.
Some, somebody on the County Council.
He's probably been dead for about two years, they have n't noticed!
In that case, if this Thursday ge get anything like the other Thursdays we've got enough to last.
Er Webb, Webb missed the first one blasted it over the top and Giggs missed one at the end.
They scored all theirs and Giggs had to score his.
to make them.
Yeah.
I mean.
Well, yeah, but it's the police's fault innit?
You know, I mean it it's bloody outrageous that the police can dictate you know, something F A Cup's been there for.
hundreds of years and police can dictate the what you're gon na do.
Yeah.
May as well.
So they're a bit sticky.
Nearly broke my neck on one, pulling one, one of those crates out.
Yeah!
Oh, actually you can smell the bleach now ca n't you?
Are you gon na do them all?
May as well.
Probably forgotten pi the line cleaners.
I did write it down for her in the list.
All this thing in the press and on the T V about Kevin Keagan being a folk hero in Newcastle, He.
He.
he only played there two years!
Yeah.
Two seasons.
I mean, I ca n't believe that he's I mean.
Oh yeah.
I know.
That's awful!
No, they've put them down in third division now.
Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, how long's he, when did he get the job, May or something, last year?
I mean he's hardly you know, he's had.
half a season, I mean that's ridiculous!
Oh God!
I know.
Every time they do it, do n't they, you know?
Yeah.
He er especially when the chairman says he's got every faith in him.
You know you're gon na a er a telegram the next morning.
Outrageous that!
Yeah.
Oh I, I remember that, I did n't watch it, I refused to watch it.
Singing whose, Keagan's praises?
That's a that was difference yo you end up voting, you end up actually voting who's the nicest human being, not.
really.
not the best footballer.
Yeah.
But I mean, he, he was n't.
particularly was he?
I mean, he went to Liverpool, Liverpool made him.
from Scunthorpe and then, I mean, he, he went after mega bucks in, in erm.
Hamburg, then you know, so being a big fish in a small pond at Southampton and then.
last couple of years a quick I mean, his contract with Newcastle worth, worth a fortune was n't it?
Cos it was one of those first ones that was sponsored by.
the.
the brewery.
was n't it?
No.
It was er, erm was n't it Newcey brown ale went and sponsored Newcastle?
But anyway, I mean, they er they ended up, instead of paying the club a sponsorship they ended up paying him, you know, like erm.
like the car phone company did with.
Ian Botham to go to Worcestershire.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
He was n't a.
he was n't a very skilful player.
Yeah.
He had a, he had a, he had a, a lot, he had a he was quite nippy and he had a good scu you know, good goal.
scoring sense.
sometimes, but I mean that was all.
He was a good player but I but I think he's always looked after himself, I mean he's he's.
he's probably one of.
the richest British footballers.
Yeah.
No.
No.
I mean it, it no, he was one of the first with the shrewd sort of business sense.
and all that.
Is he?
Yeah.
Did n't he used to be in scrap metal is what Francis was.
telling me?
Is it?
Oh.
Did you see erm This Is Your Life last night?
It was Alan Bleasdale.
Ah.
Yeah.
And they had, they had er Kenny Dalgleish and Graham Souness, and er.
Yeah.
And they had er tt erm Reed.
Yeah.
Cos he used to Alan Bleasdale used to be Peter Reed's teacher at school and the.
Yeah.
A and erm he, he coached the football te.
he coached the football team the, the.
the Kirby Boys and they won the national competition or something or other with the, with them.
No, th the till man said we have to keep erm you know the receipt one.
I know.
But we need to keep er a, a receipt in it.
Because.
Yeah.
So th there's a switch inside on, off.
He said fa because erm one of the keys is damaged erm the bot you know when the, you know the printout.
when it prints out the bottom of like the noughts and, the bottom of the figure is missing, you can read it, it's not important, but it's done because the one, it wo it's punching onto, onto metal because that paper's not on our till receipt.
No that was, that was our er that was our accounts for the year.
Yeah.
I think Volks just wanted out of the area to be honest.
Do n't care.
Mm.
Well they've got the depot at Rochdale which services up to Blackpool and this was out on a limb.
Cos, i it Kendal's done from Newcastle.
Yeah.
Up to there.
and then Rochdale up towards Blackpool and we're stuck right in the bloody middle so the er, they were a, like we were one delivery that's all it, and we were n't that big an account, you know even doing a reasonable trade you're not.
for one pub.
Yeah.
Now d'ya know how dirty those shelves get?
Mind you, the cra crates are fairly dirty are n't they at times.
Yeah, you sometimes get them some of them look as if there's, I dunno vinta vintage Newcastle Brown you know cobwebs and dust on them int there and spiders ' webs on them.
I hope Saturday's as good as last Saturday it was quite a good night that.
Did n't have enough people in to do anything else.
We'd have had, they'd have had to spent about five quid a head.
Yeah.
I'll have a look.
Well, which one's Alison?
Aha.
She's just though, she's fucking outrageous!
She does n't know what she's doing half the time!
Like you go, even saying I did serve quite a bit faster than her, which I do like, you know she still should o i if the bar done seven fifty she should have, she should have done what two, three and a half?
Oh yeah.
Mm.
No.
No.
Er.
twenty, twenty quid's worth maybe at the end.
Not much.
If it's gon na be like that we do need a glass collector do n't we?
We need somebody on to collect glasses.
Yeah, but Ka Katrin was n't, Katrin was n't.
You know.
Yeah.
No.
Well that's right, I mean, you know, two or, two or three drinks to us is only costing like a quid, well it's only a quid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I mean, they're gon na have to be from now on cos we're not gon na be, you know, we're gon na be responsible to.
somebody else, not just ourselves, you know.
Okay, if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then that's our business you know but er but when you're, when you're actually erm.
Yeah.
Present accounts to somebody else you ca n't do it like that can you?
You know water's looking disgusting!
What other results were there last night?
The.
Oh did they?
That do n't sound right.
Sunderland won, who were they playing?
Not many first division teams left is there?
About nine is there?
Oh!
Were n't they?
Did n't they play well?
I thought they played.
Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful young lads have n't they?
They're only like nineteen and twenty.
and I mean that young fullback looked brilliant!
That lef.
Yeah.
It's a funny law that er clear chance at goal job innit?
I mean it's a funny definition.
I must admit I, I if you could stop that deliberate foul it's I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean if you're gon na do it.
do it, do it, do it.
consistently.
Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score?
It's not that often actually.
I mean, okay, somebody like Besty.
you could bet on.
nine times out of ten, but.
Yeah.
Yeah, I would, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know, th th the player could let him, could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because it's, it's gon na.
be at least a fifty fifty.
chance that the goalkeeper's gon na save it innit?
Mm.
No.
No, that's right.
It's.
incredibly passed.
That's right.
United have got a strange side at the moment though.
I mean I do n't think you can it's alright having all these players but if you he does n't seem.
he does n't seem to.
have an idea of what he wants.
Cos I mean.
every week he's got a different sort of format.
Well he had him.
Yeah.
He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes.
And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather hamstring.
you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit?
Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and, and.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the best at holding a ball you know.
on his own.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The crowd were getting at them last night.
The first goal was dreadful!
My did you see it?
Yeah.
Did you see this goal?
It was a long.
it was a it was full pass inside to two fullbacks er, for the Southampton player that was running on this fullback shaded it away you know, guiding him out of it, he's running to the e sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area but he was like right on the edge as the player was coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off got it instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he was actually in the area but like he was right on the edge and he took a step back.
and stopped it with his foot.
Yeah.
Mm.
As long they, as long as they win the league I do I do n't mind.
Been a long time.
Mind you.
Leeds are still bloody doing well though.
Yeah.
Oh every week they putting it together, scoring the goals.
Are they?
Yeah.
Would n't be a bad that actually, cos if it did.
They played last year did n't they?
Yeah.
I mean they're, they ended up about what were they, about fifth or something were n't they?
And they bought er players did n't they?
They put, you know, started to buy a few you know, like Dorego and things like that.
Wallace not a bad buy.
Mm.
Yeah.
It was an awful goal that United gave away were n't it?
We I mean, it was only Palaster in, in that half.
And where the hell the fullbacks were!
Yeah.
What?
No I never.
No I never.
No it was n't.
It were n't me.
It were n't me, I never played.
I dunno where he is.
Yes.
It's meant to be a tenner.
What a tenner between ya?
Yeah.


What's he got playing like this.
Do him you wanker!
I know.
Pass!
, but someone's already told him.
Oh it's on there.
