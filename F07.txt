Oh I like that one.
The longer one.

But they're not comfortable after a while.
All fuddy duddy.
Yeah.

No.
I would n't leave them.

so when we walk round.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's no point in it.
What?
You do n't know whether.
No.
I know there was a baby one, you know that, erm pile with all different cards.
I'm sure there was, I'll go and have a look.
I'm sure there's one there.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
what shall we do with that then?
It wo n't fit round the neck.
Well no what did I do with that one for erm Ian and Diane?
When I did that one for Ian, we just tied it in at the back did n't we?
And had that.
Yeah.
No, well, it's like Nina's name, I ca n't remember it, Anastasia or something like that.
Yeah, how they got Nina out of it, it is something like Anastasia, but it's.
Well I believe er, her sisters used to call her Neen.
some something like that and they used to call her Neen.
and she said I do n't like that call me Nina.
and it stuck at.
Yeah.
Mm, nobody calls her, whatever it is.
Annalise.
Yeah.
It's funny you know, if you give them a long name.
they get very shortened.
Is it?
Yeah.
Well it's the oldy-worldy.
but I do n't know why Hayley and Ian are called theirs Jack?
Oh yes, but er.
Well the girl was gon na be Layla.
if they had a girl it was Layla.
Yeah.
Fleetwood Mac song.
Mm.
went mad on it, on Fleetwood Mac.
Yeah.
and Eugene.
I have n't heard any Eugenes.
Is it?
I.
If there are any.
no, I do n't think they'll have any more now.
No, but they do n't seem a happy couple at the moment do they?
Yeah, but there again the.
would n't give out or let that out.
if there were n't a certain amount of truth.
oh yeah.
Caroline.
Oh you know that erm course that erm cookery.
for German.
well there's a holiday one, it's a holiday.
one at, at.
Ten weeks but that would probably only be sort of erm.
Yeah.
yeah.
Well it's starting earlier than that, but I wonder whether to leave it until because I might already know most of.
Just got to get to get the sentences, oh I know quite a few words.
Yeah, I think I'll wait until September and.
May.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh I wo n't pack up at my swimming.
No, what I think I'll do swimming-wise is go down to seven fifteen.
She is n't supposed to, well if you're, you're working though are n't you?
That's right, yeah, I do n't mind.
Yeah.
Well let me just check me diary, I know.
Yeah.
You ca n't the cooker man.
Mm.
I'll take it.
Yeah.
Oh it'll stop me.
Oh I'm not thinking about it.
I'm not even bothered to think about it.
Er nine thirty to five thirty so I wo n't get in till.
I wo n't get in till I do n't know when.
get on the bus and that.
No.
Oh he'd pick me up at night, I see.

Yeah.
well really it's not that much further forward.
Hopefully if I do get it, there's somebody there, that's going from Andover.
No.
Do you?
Woolworth's.
No.
Long way?
Well it'd have to be somewhere.
Yeah.
yeah.
Places.
Yeah.
Yeah.
well for all that time.
I wo n't.
they wo n't be there.

I do n't know.
I had a feeling that it's six weeks.
Well then I'd have to stop the Income Support.
I'll have a temporary job.
I'll have a temporary job.
Yeah, we seem to get held up everywhere we go.
I could n't believe it when.
Yeah.
Oh I'll try a pair of yours on.
Yeah.
They bag.
No.
Yes.
Like a pin stripe sort of thing.

Mm.
A bit dodgy.

Yeah.
I think there's enough.
I would n't bother.
eh?
Oh no.
Mm.
We've seen them.

Make sure that hip's on the side then.
Oh I've done that for many a year.
You're not happy with it are you?

But if you're tired you can go to sleep anywhere.
He post it.
Yeah.
No.
yeah I would, I've got to write to Dot tomorrow.
cos I think it's only fair.
I'll probably have to see them anyway.
I'll probably have to go up to them.
Yeah.
Well I'll pop up there first then.
even if I'm not.
Yeah.
Why?
No I'll just say I'll pop down some time.
Yeah, whoops big.
oh big foot.
Yeah, I could.
I wonder whether how long it's gon na take Martin to fit that gear if Martin can do it.
Mm.
Oh I'd.
well we ai n't had lots and lots.
No is there a girl up this road called Rachel?
Two er, two kiddies, er there's that, that one then, it's got ta be.

You know.

And pretty.
It was very hard to turn on when I was.

Yes please.
Yeah.

Right.
Less than an hour now.
You do n't mean it though.

Mm, what about a nice long walk go and pick up Jesse and.
I heard.
Yeah.
Young still.
You do n't want to start anything off like that.
Well you could n't.
No, she'd have all those.
Alright mother I'll go and get ready.
We might as well get a bag of chips.
we might as well, yeah, what is a bag of chips.
split three ways?
No right if I'll go and get me clothes then erm er well I'm gon na have a cup of tea.
and then that'll have to be it.
because I'll be going.
Did n't seem that long last time.
Yeah.
Do n't go any.
Yeah.
Oh which one?
Oh yeah.
Oh.
They were gon na hold something here.
Oh dear.
Yeah.
Convention hall.
I'm going to get my clothes.
Yeah, I think so.
yeah.
I do n't know.
Well we did n't do any.
we did n't do anything in that erm bob sleigh, four man bob sleigh.
Yeah.
It's not surprising they do n't come anywhere, they've got so much erm hype and pressure.
Hankies.
Oh I'll have one then.
if you've got it.
Thank you.
I should of wet my hair down.
Mm, can you see with me sitting in the middle?
Yeah me, it made me late on Friday.
Yeah.
I had to scoot round Church Lane.
and I left twenty to.
Down here and trying to get past to get into Crick Laid.
because you never know whether they're going to turn.
They do n't use their indicators any more.
er, if they're, er far, not too far away from the other car.
they'll come round on his indicator.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah but I was coming out at half past nine.
yeah, well quarter to, twenty to ten.
There were lorries, cars, the lot.
taxis and one thing I know is they scoot round Church Lane.
and it was busy, but that's beside the point.
Yeah.
These are like buying bad old crisps, the other one's there.
Yeah.
Very, very friendly, but he had his shirt tail hanging out the lot.
I thought you little devil.
Big one?
Big bus.
Aah.
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No you're not in a car.
Have you got?
Have you?
Yeah.
up there.
Mm.
I think right.
if we ever thought to ourselves what we're doing.
you might there, it drops you right.
ai n't you?
Who?
Yeah.
Mm.
Very good.
Very good.
No.
Oh that illuminist.
Yeah it was terrific.
Tired now, yeah.
No.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.
Tired.
Tired now.
Chippendales.
I know, it'll be worth suffering.
it'll be worth suffering Chippendales.
Chippendales on Thursday.
Yes.
I know they do n't.
Yeah, going home it does.
Yeah.
No.
I do n't know, is there skittles somewhere?
Well he normally gives a little er.
So, right here.
Eh?
Well people do go out to restaurants.
I think it's marvellous they go out to a restaurant.
but.
really, have you?
Of course you can.
oh I know, please.
stuck, he's stuck again is n't he?
oh you might get him interested in different things.
you never know.
you're never too old to change.
Oh well oh dear.
It's brilliant.
Yeah.
more for the show.
It brought you to the place and then.
and then it just it.
erupted.
My feet are aching now, I've got thick tights on.
shoes.
That's not a brilliant idea.
Yes.
I think.
Then I can sew it up and I've only got the.
one sleeve.
I hope so.
When it gets the toggles on it should be okay.
When it gets the toggles on it should be okay.
I do n't know what one to do next really.
I think I'll do another plain one, but this one, some were plain.
but.
erm, that chunky one.
it's not just plain, there's so many stitches erm stocking stitch and so many rib.
so.
it'll have some pattern but not.
a terrific.
cos it has two bands of rib.
Then you can help me unpick it.
No it had n't been knitted up too long.
that's what I do n't want for it to er.
crinkle too quickly.
Oh yeah.
No but as you, I'll use that what's not a.
Yeah, oh if I can undo that one then I can do the sleeve.
cos that'll be quite.
that will be quite intra intricate.
Yeah.
I think there's quite a lot of plum and.
I think it was two balls.
and you've got two, well what was in them?
You would of got two cos you would of been a big one wo n't you?
Just that colour.
Body.
Two black feet.
Yeah.
can do one like that with that mustard up the top shelf.
with the black.
Yeah.
I saw your Andrew the other day.
I would think Andrew doing some.
three pound balls and three pound thirty, er three pound twenty seven.
Or then you'd do like the four, four, four flares.
flat back.
Yeah.
No what, what you normally do with those is er, say one half black and one half yellow and you have a yellow sleeve that side.
and a black sleeve that side.
Well it would.
Of course it does.
have n't we?
I know.
Well I shall use the mohair next.
There is.
Well what I want is the black and the cerise.
because I'm not sure whether to put all different colours in.
or the black and the cerise and all the jacquards.
because that could be quite effective.
Yeah, that's why I think if I did all the jacquard in the cerise.
that would show up beautiful.
because what they've done on that pattern, why they've got so many different colours, where it mixes so you've got your red and your.
green, they've got like an orangey.
you know where it crosses.
you know like that one of Howard's jumper.
well they've got it so that the colours in the middle.
mingle.
and like you've sort of got a yellow and a green, they've put like an olive in that, an olive colour, but I have n't got colours that I can.
mix like that.
No, that's the thing.
Oh I know.
Yeah, but I do n't know it'll be quite effective.
Yeah.
unless I go up that shop, top shop and have a look at those gramme balls, yellow, oranges.
red and got those to put in the black.
but there again my er.
Ninety nine P.
No but there again.
Well I'd put in the cerise and have all the jacquard colours, it, it would look very effective.
No, no it does n't how many black ones are there?
Two.
No just one.
Yeah.
Well I.
Mm.
Erm.
I wonder if I've seen one of those.
but they want seven and I want to put that big bit at the bottom.
No.
Or was it seventy five ball?
No.
Oh.
Yeah.
We wan na look at shoes.
But then again it's not a brilliant idea going on a.
for wool when we've got so many.
cos we'll come back loaded up.
I do n't know.
Well you see the trouble is when we're buying it over there right.
we buy six hundred.
which is two hundred per person.
Well that's four pound, four pound.
Forty.
Four pound thirty six where you'd pay two pounds, four pounds for two hundred grammes.
But there again it's better wool that you're buying from the.
Yeah.
yeah.
Well the trouble is we go over there and we buy a good buy.
but it might not be the colours that we're actually looking for.
And I said the mustard.
Yeah.
Er, yeah.
Yeah.
It's very silly.
Yeah.
See, that's what I've bought patterns now.
What I want to find one is one without a well.
Yeah, so it can hang over trousers.
A long one.
Yeah, yeah.
We know that one, that woman was wearing that white one.
now something like that, that can go over a skirt.
Yeah.
Yeah.
but then again it'll take me longer to find that one this morning.
Yeah.
it caught my eye and I thought well.
Yeah and then again you do n't always wan na, erm start all along, with them do you?
And then you've got different colours that do n't really go with that, but.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Probably do now.
Yeah.
Yeah, but there again you see they're, you're not going into a shop saying oh they look nice.
Yeah.
It must be easier to find wider.
Yeah.
Well we could even, oh dear we could even go.
do n't we?
If we're gon na spend money you might as well go to Littlewoods or.
somewhere where it's decent.
Yeah.
I had a doggy bag the other day.
doggy bag when their.
in the end they do.
No I forgot I was downstairs were n't I so?
Yeah.
They're smart are n't they?
But they've got to be long enough in the leg for me.
Yeah.
Cord ones are beautiful.
Everybody does.
They are very stylish.
Eh?
Say?
yeah it's strange innit coming back?
Yeah but it's a clearer road as well.
Well yes they're all sort of bubbly to get out there.
We've seen it now were tired.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I think cos they're packed up and they're all fresh and.
put the lettuce in and put the tomato in.
and then.
No they were very nice.
but I, I could n't of ate before we came out.
Yes.
Oh yes oh yeah.
Probably do a.
or something.
cos that'll fill wo n't it?
You wo n't have as much.
Oh yeah.
Have my cake?
Well it can stay in there.
No I do n't think you'll have both.
Eat it in the evening?
No.
Yeah but that, that makes it large, large.
That looked a bit scrumptious that.
Eh, start thinking about as much as.
I guess I'll give him a kick up the arse if he.
Oh he wo n't say no to me.
Not very often anyway.
erm.
yet?
No.
Well we'll soon know if he snores.
Well he was.
nodding.
Oh I do n't know, I do n't know.
It is, I make it a couple of minutes past.
Oh, we'll be in well before twelve.
Is n't it clever how they changed the co costumes, er like that pink.
With the black, you know it had the black bit as well.
or something.
Yes, always worthwhile getting one.
That was at the front.
yeah.
Velcro.
Yeah, that was her favourite one that was.
I think that was very clever, very, very clever.
Well they are.
She was brilliant.
I think that, which one was the other one that was.
Yeah.
They look ever so perfect.
Yeah.
They're ever so heavy them are n't they?
Well they'll last for a long time.
I think.
I'd be surprised if she never get erm, her mansion in her.
her sort of own mansion.
Yeah that one.
Do n't matter, must of had it done.
I think she's had it highlighted.
If you look at her face she had quite a pointed nose.
she's in Washington.
Seattle.
Oh this one Jane Taylor.
A bella blo, blonde from Whitney Bay.
cos they do, but when.
The top trainers at home and abroad, Claire Hurst, the National and International Championships, I've seen her on ice on the.
Oh when I had this one it went over to.
did n't it?
Unfortunately it went.
We should of got two really should n't we?
We learn a lot of things but then again as I say.
Yeah, have some good times.
Mm.
Yes I like that that one.
that's brilliantly, very brilliant.
Yeah.
They remind me of Liquorice All Sorts.
I do n't really know.
Choreography.
Yeah.
that must be a high point in a career you know, when you first see them go out.
of who thought it all up, the opening night.
Switzerland, oh.
oh that's.
Caroline, Alison.
They do n't give you pictures of everybody.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah I think it was Caroline.
That's the one is n't it?
That she.
Well it has to give the effect.
it has to give you that effect I thought it was marvellous.
I thought it was marvellous.
Oh yeah.
Exactly.
It's thirteen fifty a ticket, it's erm, I do n't think you can moan at a night out for that, especially a night out like that.
Anyway nobody's gon na want to get up tomorrow.
Nobody's gon na want to get up tomorrow.
I did n't want to get up this morning so.
But not really.
Yeah.
Yeah got lettuce to eat.
so we've got to get some Oh we'll have to go somewhere snazzy cos I've got that black dress to wear have n't I?
Eh?
Ca n't wear that again.
Yeah.

Oh yeah.

Er.
Oh I do n't know, you got.
Yes.
Do n't let me swim on my back on Thursday.
If I swim on my back I do n't do my front.
I cheat when I swim on my back.
Oh I know.
That's what puts me off, when we have those two.
and we went on that other side.
That annoys me when I get.
people like that.
But there's the lanes, there are nights when it's just even lanes.
so they just have.
Oh he's a right pain.
Yeah, but he's not a bad swimmer.
he just do n't like going down to the deep end.
Yeah, they're going for a swim.

Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen twenty two.

Oh yeah, that's good!
And this'll be your easier one to sew up cos it's blue.
No?
Yeah.
Well it's been a very cold, cold winter.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Should n't do.
Yeah.
No ho.
Yeah.
You've got to have it?
It's like cling film but it's microwave.
Must have it do you?
Cover it with a lid.
I would imagine it's doing exactly the same.
Christ, it's only up, microwave film only just come out!
It ai n't been out that long.
Bring in your Microwave Know How.
Oh well.
It's probably cold enough out there to be the fridge.
I said it's probably cold enough out there.
Ah?
Yeah.
Bring me the little book, that might have it as well.
No, the little one.
It says here.
Cover and wrapping, wrapping food.
Ah?
Yeah.
By covering the food during microwave cooking you can speed up the cooking procedure.
This also prevents splattering and juices all over the cooker wall.
That's the gravy.
It would be, yeah.
There are several ways of covering food.
use a tight fit lid.
to a dish.
or use a saucer or plate to cover.
Use cooking bag cooking bags or roaster bag.
for vegetables and meat.
Remember to replace the metal ties provided with elastic band.
or string.
Cling film, plastic wrap is inva, invaluable to all microwave users.
But do remember to puncture holes.
So I would imagine as long as you put a lid on it.
it's doing exactly the same.
No.
Because it cooks at the top and then cooks inwards.
I would n't bother!

Plates in the.
Yeah.
I really would n't bother.
Right.
Just say I've popped down to see the.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a.
Alright?
Asked her if she's signed on at Trevalle.
Trevalle.
Job Spot?

Oh yeah.

So that'll be alright for tomorrow.

got woken up last night.
Sort of somebody's put the the road.
If somebody wanted to get out quickly.
and could n't.
and they went to the wrong door and said is this car anything.
Because say Gail and Keith go got woken up at three o'clock in the morning.
