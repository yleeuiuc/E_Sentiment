
On the remote control, he wanted to do it.
Yes, you can switch it off if you want to.
We can switch it on again later on so there's no worry.
Are we going to do these fish?
Well I'll come and help you Tim cos we do n't want it falling all over the place.
Whoops.
Careful careful.
Oh that's the empty one.
That's alright.
Here's the full one.
Ooh!
Hallo Bertie.
How are you?
Do fishes like people?
Do n't know, what do you think?
Hallo Bertie Edward.
Do you like us?
Yeah?
You want to have your sleeves rolled up?
Yeah well we'll just undo the cuff.
And roll it up.
And there we are.
And this one.
Well that's we need Christopher to do it as well do n't we?
Now whatever you do do n't drip it all over me stereo.
Okay?
Who's gon na get the weed out?
Well you could perhaps do it together but be careful.
Mind the fish.
Whoops.
If you drop it into this one with the clean water in.
Whoops, look out cos it's dripping.
Right, it's Christopher's turn then, you've had one turn.
Oh he has n't got his sleeves done up yet look.
Two what?
True.
You'd look funny with four would n't you?
Just let me go and get the cups from the kitchen.
Tim is making you what?
Drop the mm.
That's it.
Whoops.
Well as they're Christopher's fish we'll let Christopher do the fish d sorry do the bridge.
Go on then.
Whoops.
Got it.
Okay now then when we pu whoops that's it.
Now I think we'll, that needs washing out does n't it, that bridge?
It's pretty mucky.
Right, put the dirty water in this bucket then with the bridge.
What the jug?
I think you'd be better with a cup myself.
No come on cos he might go and get the fish in the jug and then we'll be in a mess.
Be careful because they do n't want to be in a thunder storm.
Hello fish.
Are you alright in there?
Yes thank you.
Oh good.
Right.
Well just take all the, it's pretty dirty, look at the stones.
Mm.
Okay.
We need to leave them some to swim in before we catch them.
Just a little bit more.
Gently Tim.
Well what do you think would happen to the poor things if left them in that water?
Do you know that fish ca n't breathe unless they're in water?
So if they're out of the water they die just like if we're under the water too long we die.
Right, I think we should stop now and get them out of there.
Stop Tim.
Can I borrow this, this cup now to fish these fish out.
Fish the fish.
Come on fish.
Here you come.
Are you Edward or Bertie?
Oh Chris was the expert.
He knows.
Whoops.
Right Edward, come on.
Come on Edward.
In here please.
Thank you.
Right into the water.
Whoops.
Bertie's disappearing.
Come on Bertie, in this cup.
Aha caught you.
There we are.
Now then I'll take those over there.
You do n't need to do that now look cos I can just carry the thing into the kitchen.
Come and help me with the stones in the kitchen.
No no.
Do n't get the stones out you dilly What a noggin!
Right, let's take this into the kitchen and clean it up.
Can you bring the bridge.
Yeah we need the bridge but do n't tip the.
Try not to drip it everywhere though Tim.
Mm.
Pardon?
Yeah.
We've already got some water.
Ugh look, it's horrible.
Ugh!
Think we shall have to scrub these cos it's so horrid today.
Mummy what?
Oh my goodness.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
I thought you were just bringing the bridge.
Did n't realize you were bringing the whole thing.
There we go.
When we've what?
Yeah, if you want to.
We've actually got clean water in there cos that's clean water that's in the bucket that the fish are swimming in now.
Hello.
I've lost the brush.
We need a brush for this.
Oh here we are.
Right.
Is it your favourite dinner?
Do you know what it is?
It's meant to be cottage pie but I've put some.
I've put some breadcrumbs on the top instead of cheese.
Because we seem to like that at the moment do n't we?
It needs to go in the oven really.
It needs to go in the oven really.
Pardon?
What did you say?
Really tatty?
What?
Oh you mean the stones.
Yeah.
It's quite it's quite erm.
It's a long time, no no no, it's a long time we since we er cleaned them.
It's just dirty really rather than tatty.
Whoops.
Pardon?
Tim, what are you doing?
Can you come in here Tim so I can see you please.
Tim.
Let's go and see what he's up to.
Come on.
What are you doing?
You're not throwing water are you?
No we'll all get wet if you do.
Cos we're not, we do n't want a bath.
Why what?
Cos they're cos they're messy.
Look you can see it's all brown.
Ugh.
If we just wipe round the outside of the tank though, I think that will help.
Cos it's gone all funny inside, can you see?
Whoops.
Ugh look at that.
I think it's the kind of food we're using cos it's different food from the food that we had at the beginning.
It did n't seem to get as bad as this at the beginning.
I do n't know.
It just did n't.
Pardon?
Yes we used the little pot and then we bought that box.
Hello.
What's your problem?
You alright?
You want to put water in?
Well we'll just give them one more swish.
What little pot?
The fish food you mean?
Well the thing was, because we bought a box and the box was a bit flimsy, I thought we would put the new fish food into the old pot, you see.
So the old pot has still got some in but it's really the new food.
Do you see?
There's still some food in there as well.
Right, okay.
If you want to put your jug of water in now, this is your moment.
Do you want to get a jug full.
Do you want to get some from the tap?
You can if you want to.
Because it'll probably need more than what's in the bucket anyway.
Tim, do you want to carry this?
Do you want to carry this?
This tank.
Can you manage?
Do n't drop it will you?
Shall I hold the cup.
Do n't drop it whatever you do.
Fill it up to the number one there look.
That means one pint.
What?
Okay.
There we are.
Put the dinner in.
Ooh.
Oh well done.
Right, away you go, see if you can get it in the.
Oops.
I think you're doing it a bit roughly Tim.
Can you do it more gently so the stones do n't move.
Put, tip it on to the bridge and then you wo n't make a hole cos the bridge will be in the way.
Oop!
What a dilly.
Ah no.
If you're gon na do it like that we're gon na have to stop you from doing it.
Come on.
Mind the fish.
Poor things.
That's better Tim.
Oh no!
Disaster.
Move the video quick.
Make sure it's dried.
Oh!
Now just watch it with those fish please while I get a cloth.
Yeah.
So is our room look.
It's a good job it's just water and not orange squash.
Oh Christopher be careful.
That was quite clever really.
As long as you did n't hurt him.
There you go mister fish you can go for a swim now.
Now look we've got a fish in there and a fish in there Tim so we must be careful now because otherwise we're gon na hurt them.
I think I'd better fish that one out do you?
Yeah.
So when you pour the water do n't go tipping it.
on top of him cos he'll get a shock.
Let's have this weed out.
You gon na help the weed?
Whoops.
Alright.
Woo er alright wait a minute now cos mummy's gon na fish this fish out.
Oh look at all the bits in there.
I do n't know how you caught it love.
It was rather clever really.
You've just got to be careful because.
if you're not careful you'll hurt them you see because if you touch their tails or their fins or something.
There we are.
Right now when you're tipping it in now I should use a cup now Christopher cos the jug will be too much water for them.
Alright?
Now just gently now.
Well watch where you're pouring Tim.
Not on top of the fish please.
Go on then.
Whoops.
Oh look, next door's got a new car.
Unless it's a visitor.
What do you think?
Got a white one look.
Er bit more I think.
Gently does it.
That was a good one Tim, well done.
See if you can tip it without the bits going in then.
Whoop whoop.
What?
Oh well.
Never mind.
It will come out next week.
Well er I think those bits that are in there are really just bits of weed.
I do n't think it's anything too awful.
What's this thing?
Ooh.
That's a funny thing.
I should think so.
Just a little bit.
I think we've nearly got enough now do n't you?
Well if we have too much more we shall.
have it overflowing.
Mm?
I think we must stop before we get right to the top.
No.
Whoops.
I'll tell you what look.
You hold the cup and I'll tip the bucket, right?
I'll hold your cup.
There you go.
All done.
Right, we need a cloth now to wipe up the bits round the edges.
What are you doing?
Well look why do n't you have one of these then you can do it properly.
Well you're a silly billy you are.
It's the edges you've got to do look, not inside it.
Yeah, we need the roof on do n't we?
Mm.
Do you want to pick up the top, the lid please.
Except if we're gon na put food in we did n't ought to put it on just yet did we?
Oh we could put food through there.
No you want dry hands cos if you touch the food with wet hands guess what happens?
Can you guess?
It sticks to your fingers.
Yeah, just make sure, oh look at your trousers!
Soaked.
When did you do that?
Okay well just dry.
your fingers first.
Well you did the I poured your, the water into your cup so it's Christopher's turn to feed them.
Well you do n't need the box love cos the box's got some food in but the that's got the rest of it in.
Well it's okay about washing them, it's the dryness that matters.
Are they dry, your hands?
Yeah?
Go on then.
No not too much.
You watch underneath Tim, see if they come up to the top.
Are they coming?
I should think so.
Go on then.
Just a little spot.

Well they're probably a bit shocked now cos they've got clean water.
Not quite.
Was it?
Oh it does n't matter.
Good.
That's that done.
I do n't know.
I'm never sure if they eat this weed cos it does n't look as if it's going anywhere.
Can you watch what?
The video?
What do you want to watch?
Pardon?
There is n't anything new, no.
I have n't got round to videoing today cos I was out teaching this afternoon.
Er I was out at Tesco's this morning.
In fact I went to wave goodbye to grandma.
I took her to the train.
You'll never guess, when we got to the train station.
when we got to the train station, guess what erm grandma had to catch?
A bus.
Because the trains were n't running.
They're erm electrifying the line.
You know they're putting up the electric lines.
overhead?
Well, they've got to have a bus to get to Barnet Green I think.
Er no.
I think it's nineteen ninety three before it opens.
It's nineteen ninety two.
Next year.
Er yes I suppose it will be.
When you're seven.
Cos you'll be six this year wo n't you?
And seven next year.
When you're seven it'll be finished.
That's a long time innit?
No.
Be a while.
Actually it is.
It'll be about.
It's fifty two weeks, fifty two weeks in a year.
Oh Tim.
the microphone.
You just pulled it down, it's supposed to sit on there.
Well a man came earlier on today and he said please would we record conversations that we have all the time.
So you do n't have to touch it, you just have to talk to me and just leave it sitting there.
It does n't matter.
Yes?
Mm.
It just picks up your voice.
You know like in church?
You know when we go to church and you have a microphone on, and it makes your voice go round all the church?
Well it's a bit like that but instead of making it go round all the church it goes on to the tape.
So it records.
Yes.
There's there's a tape in my pocket look.
In there.
We'll have a look at it later on.
Oh very, very tuneful Tim.
Because there are some people that want to listen to what we say in our house, and what we say to each other.
And then they can think about language and how people use language.
In France?
No, it wo n't pick up our voices in France.
But in France if they did the same thing they would be talking in French down their machine.
Hello.
Ooh, what a lovely tune.
Mm.
It is a funny one.
Now it's five o'clock.
What time do you think daddy is going to get home today?
Shall we guess?
Sixty one.
That will be a funny time.
There's no such time as sixty one.
In sixty one minutes?
That will be another hour and one minute, which will make it one minute past six.
It's five o'clock at the moment and I do n't know time he's coming.
Cos he's supposed to come home early today but then he was in Pontepool yesterday so he might not be.
You want to watch the telly.
What do you want to watch on the telly?
Think about bones again?
Oh!
You like that one do n't you?
I'll tell you what, when I was in school yesterday I went into a classroom and there, hanging in a classroom, was a skeleton made out of cardboard.
And all the children had made all the different bones and it was all hanging together.
It looked really funny.
Hello.
Are you worrying?
Why are you why are you worrying?
No no no.
It's just a microphone dear.
I've been having one of my little do's again with men on the doorstep.
We have to record all our conversations for a week, okay?
Off and on.
And then away they go to erm.
I'll get you the letter dear so you can read it.
. You can switch it off.
if you want to say anything too personal dear. amp;;.
00010; Just hold on.
Anyway, did you have a good shop?
You what?
What do you mean tut?
Do n't you think it's fun?
I told him you would think it was fun dear.
You'll soon get used to it wo n't worry you.
Yes, it's the bones.
Mhm.
Think About it's a science programme.
It's got bones on.
Erm are you ready for your tea dear?
Well tea's ready for you.
Why is there a high speed on there?
What is it?
Oh.
No.
Oh.
I do n't remember that.
When?
Did we go across there?
Oh of course cos we went on the train did n't we.
down to Exeter.
Wherever that is.
It is really teatime Tim.
We're just watching this cos daddy's excited.
Have we recorded this then?
Oh I know what this is.
This had started this morning before erm Rosie and Jim.
No, only me.
Yeah.
Just told him.
Well I do n't particularly want one but it was just interesting.
And if I did n't s.
Oh that's the headphones if you want to listen back.
Yes Timothy.
Have you not been to the toilet yet?
Oh right.
Come on then, I'll come with you.
Before I get the dinner out, and then when I come down it'll be dinner time.
I'll just switch the oven off.
I've just switched the oven off.
No not all night.
We sleep with them on do n't we?
What did you do?
Hit your fingers on the door?
Yeah.
Here.
You hurt yourself on a big stick?
Ian gave you a prickly stick and you hurt yourself?
Oh that was silly.
I do n't suppose he thought it was prickly.
He probably was k feeling kind because he thought he was giving you a nice stick.
Right, let's go and get this dinner out.
Did Ian get pricked?
I do n't know.
Did Ian get pricked Tim?
No.
Just you.
I expect he had a smooth stick for himself did he?
Ian had a smooth stick.
I expect it was one of these walks you know, and Ian found a stick and then he thought Tim would like one.
Do n't touch it Tim.
Tim?
Ho how did Ian not get pricked?
When he picked the stick up you mean?
I do n't know.
Perhaps he just picked it up in the right place.
Who?
Ian did n't?
No.
Well I expect he just handed it to Tim and Tim picked it up thinking it was smooth.
Turned out turned out to be prickly.
Go on.
Oh, could be.
Do n't know.
How many.
sprouts can you cope with, two?
None, you're joking, you've got ta have one.
I'll just leave one on there.
Mhm.
It is a tiny one.
They're all pretty tiny.
I would n't touch that if I were you cos it's very very hot.
Taste alright?
Excuse me mister fingers.
Oh good.
Is that too much for you Tim?
Will that be okay?
You choose it.
Right, there you are then.
This is very hot Tim, so do n't touch whatever you do else you'll be crying.
This is you now coming up.
Mm.
Er.
In the washing up.
Careful do n't tip it off.
Carry it straight.
Mind your hands!
That's for daddy.
Is that alright for you daddy?
There you go.
got it.
I put your bib on Tim?
It does, but it'll do for now.
I've been thinking it's needed some more in for the last few meals.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Can you sit down properly please.
We're starting now so could you sit down on your on your bottom.
No, I want you sitting down now before we begin.
Come on.
Well why do you think?
Yeah.
Good grief.
This family's falling to pieces.
The family.
No we're not really.
Yeah.
So, how's your day been then?
Have you caught up with everything?
I do n't know.
I was n't there.
Julie?
She's been with you, has n't she?
In school all day.
Or.
whenever.
Do n't know what she is actually, she's sort of attached.
Maybe she's gon na be erm you know like erm community.
community service or something.
On one of these schemes.
You know these schemes?
Oh is she?
Gon na be a nurse in a hospital?
Oh well well then.
So what was she doing with you then?

No.
She'll be going soon, perhaps.
And meanwhile sh yeah, meanwhile she's got to do something.
But who was n't there today?
Pardon?
Mrs.
It is our back door yeah.
It's been banging all day because I ca n't be bothered to go out there and shut it.
Are n't I hopeless?
Waking them up?
Come on, if they're asleep during the day they ought to be woken up.
Do you want to go out there and do it then, now?
Oh!
Okay, I'm guilty.
Actually mine's not too bad either.
He's gone to shut the back gate cos mummy could n't be bothered.
She should have done it ages ago.
It keeps banging in the wind.
Mm.
Were you out in the playground in the wind?
There was a rainbow today.
Did you see the rainbow?
Oh.
Did you?
Mm.
Where was it?
Mm.
Oh.
But the one I saw was about half past two.
I must have missed the one that you saw.
You saw a rainbow with Ann?
That would be the same rainbow as I saw I think.
Mm.
Guess what I've been doing today?
Mm.
Just half a day.
Yeah.
No.
And Ian.
Apparently he had a.
had a bit of a do did n't you, together?
Did you keep hitting each other or something?
Oh.
What happened with the Postman Pat and the what was it, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam or something?
And you did n't get on very well did you?
Ann said they kept both wanting the same thing at the same time.
A bit traumatic I think.
Probably two afternoons in one week was a little bit too much.
Mm.
Well Miss rang me up about twenty to nine and said could I come in for the day and I said you've had it for the day though consider the afternoon.
So.
No.
I was n't in his class.
It, that's why she was panicking I think because she'd got Mrs off and she'd got June off.
Mm.
Mm.
So I think because I'd done her class once before she thought I'll her in again.
Apparently she's been off all week.
Mm.
June.
Which is interesting because I think I saw her on Wednesday night.
Oh no, it was the week, a week last Wednesday was n't it?
Mm.
Yeah it was quite nice in her classroom today because.
Four of the erm.
four of the problems had erm disappeared off with Mrs.
You what?
I wo n't finish first on pudding?
I might do.
And Tim has been to nursery today.
And?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because he had it for breakfast.
I do n't know, you read it.
What did it say?
You'll have to read it to daddy after tea.
Ah that's right.
She said you're gon na ask the duck or something to lay another egg for you.
Yeah.
She's got three ducks and a drake apparently.
A male duck.
You know like there's mummies and daddies, ladies and gentlemen?
Well ducks and drakes are just the same.
Drakes are the gentlemen.
Not at Holly Cottage, no.
Good question.
Do n't know.
Apparently they're laying profusely at the moment.
But they have n't had any success with ducklings.
We got a painting today.
Yes we have n't him that have we?
What's in it?
Counting things is it?
You have lots and lots of books?
Oh yes.
At school you do.
Tim has one book at nursery do n't you?
And a work book.
What?
It's not at nursery any more.
It's at home is n't it?
Because you finished it.
You've got a new one now at nursery?
Mm.
Cos we've got the old one at home have n't we?
did n't get it.
Who runs out of numbers?
I do n't think it matters, does it?
Do n't think it matters.
It's not like your maths books where you have one two three four five six seven and so on.
She just makes it up as she goes along.
She draws him pictures.
Oh she wo n't run out of books, cos she'll make some new ones.
She makes her own.
There is a little bit more.
There's a little bit more to eat dad, if you're interested.
Right.
Children?
No?
Good gracious.
Oh alright then.
Tim?
Do you want some more?
No what, love?
No carrots and no tomato.
I'll try that and see what, oh I ca n't do it like that.
It's hardly worth it.
I've done me best.
How's that?
You've had the.
Well I'm sorry.
It's a bit difficult to get the tomato out cos it's all chopped in with the mince you see.
I'm sorry it's not cordon bleu dear like you've been having at Pontepool.
Hour?
Why, what happened?
I do n't think so.
Mm.
I've been doing it.
I was very good at it was n't I last night, do n't you think?
Mm?
Well, we're not supposed to do exercises after we've just had our tea so we'll see.
Since who was here?
We have.
Oh perhaps you have n't.
Perhaps.
Anyway, you were telling me about meals.
Mm.
At Pontepool.
Taking a long time.
I do n't know.
A place.
It's like that place with that cow pie.
I thought that was the most boring meal I.
Trying to be totally different and failing miserably.
Anyway, go on.
Did it take a long time?
Was it any good?
When it came?
And this was n't the hotel or anything.
Well obviously it was a restaurant.
Oh.
Could n't afford a hotel meal.
What do you fancy dear?
Oh!
That's Tim's.
What do n't you want?
What?
Oh Tim!
Do n't.
What do n't you want?
The fruit?
Well you'll have to have some fruit.
I'm sorry.
He does n't want cherries.
Last time we had a I remember having a row about this before.
It is n't too much at all.
Now daddy, what do you want on this?
Well just keep quiet and we'll talk about it in a minute.
Yeah.
Did he?
Lucky you.
Right Christopher.
You're er just happy to have anything are you?
You have n't got anything in there yet Tim.
Just hold on.
Do you want another cherry daddy as erm?
Will you be wanting a cherry?
No.
I did n't think so.
Right.
You've got loads of cherries, do n't worry.
So's Christopher.
Now then.
Ice-cream or yogurt Christopher?
Ice-cream or yogurt dear?
Just a minute.
We're not ready yet for you.
Pardon?
I know.
Now listen, to have yogurt and ice-cream you have to have some fruit okay.
And what's more.
and what's more you have to have more than that Tim.
Look.
I've put some banana in for you.
There.
That one there?
Right.
Is that alright now?
Are you happy with that?
Ice-cream.
There you go.
Satisfied? all that fuss for.
Well it's all called tea really.
You have a first course and a second course and could call it all I do n't know what you call it really, I never do know what to call it all.
That's confusing.
Right.
We'll sit down and eat soon.
Ah.
Well it was a bit hectic cos of having this phone call to say I've got to teach in the afternoon.
I thought I'd better do all my jobs which I thought was going to be spread across the d the day.
So I went to Tesco's first thing straight back from the nursery and guess what I forgot to do?
Take me list with me.
No I'd got me money, but not the list.
Mm.
And anything might happen.
I checked it off when I got back and it's not too bad.
Forgot about three or four things.
The juice.
And then, after I'd gone round to Tesco's I went to see to collect grandma to take her to the train.
Which was n't a train, it was a bus.
Mm.
There was one.
Mm.
She's going to Manchester.
To see Irene.
Do you remember Irene?
Mm.
She'll still be in Manchester.
Mm.
It'll be funny wo n't it?
Yes, we were.
I do n't know.
We have n't really decided that but yes, I suppose we could.
You think we'll go to grandma's house?
Mm.
We'll see what she says when she comes back.
Anyway, arrived at the station and there was this great coach standing there waiting to take them all to.
It was blocking the whole of the car park.
So this car that was trying to get out was sitting there waiting and there was no driver in sight and people were rushing about all over the station trying to find the driver.
Anyway it did n't worry us cos we were behind the coach.
But I did feel sorry for the man who was trying to get out cos he must have been in there for ages.
I suppose they thought that there would n't be anybody trying to get out cos the train.
was n't due out.
So I just left her getting on the bus.
I did n't sort of wait till the bus had gone or anything.
I finally managed to get a a card for the wedding in Tesco's.
You know, I sent them a card, Mark and Trish.
Mark and Trish.
You know grandma's going to go to a wedding when she goes away?
That's why she's gone away.
Well that's where the wedding is.
Beg your pardon?
When you get to the station to catch the train?
What do you mean?
Mm.
Grandma went to the station to catch a train to get to Birmingham.
Yeah?
And then she got another train in Birmingham.
Except she did n't get a train to Birmingham, she got a bus.
Well, she got a bus to Barn Green And a train at Barn Green to Birmingham.

So she can play with them for a little bit.
Oh yes.
They will be all ready.


Is it on the floor somewhere?
On the settee.
You had it on the settee a bit ago.
On the floor under the settee?
Do n't know.
That looks like it.
Very posh paper.
Do n't know why you were shouting at me.
What?
I hope she can talk duck language.
Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack.
She wo n't really.
I think she's just pretending.
Well you can try.
Well I always I always try quacking at ducks and they seem to quack back.

You're juggling?
Mm.
Brilliant.
Now you need to do it with two.
There's another one on the floor down there.

This will be interesting, see whether he can do it.
Go on.
Whoa, missed.

Would you like to pass your bowl over.

Tim are you wanting any fruit?
Are you wanting any fruit?
Tim?
Are you sure?
It's the same ice-cream that we had before, yeah.
At least it would be if I could get into it.
It's beginning to melt.
Mhm.
Do you want some?
I do n't think so, I think you've had enough really.
You had loads the first time round.
Pop goes Christopher and Tim.
Are we supposed to take anything for this do tonight?
Well I do n't know really.
Well it's a course that erm Alan's.
There's a what love?
And where is that paper?
No idea where it is, do you?
It's in the drawer, down there.

And me.
On Saturdays.
What now?
Yeah okay.
Here it is.
Here you are.
You ca n't cope?
Do you need a rest?
Do you want to go and shimmy off while I get them ready for bed?
That would be a.
sort of job.
Just do n't make yourself sick.
explain what there was that went on.
But it'll be different wo n't it?
I mean somebody's talking to you about something different.
So long as what?
You're awake.
Is it going to be a two hour lecture?
Oy!
Stop.
Well it wo n't be will it?
Because there will be.
Pardon?
Tim, please stop cos I ca n't hear daddy think let alone hear him talk.
I think this meal is finished, do you?
Ellie?
She's done old telephone number.
She said she'd the family.
Yeah, there's four of them, so.
No.
You missed.
I think you're throwing it too high, that's your trouble.
Fourteen.
Fourteen.

Well, that's what we'll tell her to do..
And we'll give her a phone number.

Wonderful.
It's tomorrow so that's okay.
What these two?
No.
No.
I've seen those hands.
No the back one's messy.
Well there's still some dirt there look.
Yeah?
Is n't it?
What's that then?
That's a spot.
Mm.
Dry your face then cos your face is a mess.
Yes I have.
But none that you can juggle with inside here.
Because balls are for outside.
I think you need to go to the toilet the way you're jiggling around.
Go to the toilet.
Yeah you could make balls with newspaper if you wanted.
But these need folding up and putting away.
Surprise surprise.
Good gracious.
Right, one pair of pyjamas for you.
Right, who's gon na get ready first then?
Well Tim's half ready.
Whoops a daisy.
Are you alright?
I think you did fall off your bed.
Can you get your socks off?
. Oh look at these patches.
They're coming off already.
Tut oh that's.
Go on?
Oh he's not!
Would you tell him that I've carefully s did those on.
And I do n't want them pulled off thank you very much, tell him.
Because if he if he pulls those off, there's gon na be a hole underneath there, and then we're gon na have holy trousers again.
What?
And what did you say?
Yeah.
Oh.
Was this during story time or something?
Was this during story time or something?
Well please tell him that your mummy says please would you not do that again.
Cos I know it's bad bad enough having patches let alone having somebody pull them off.
Mm.
You're doing well there Tim.
I think you are.
You've done most of the buttons.
Shall I do your top one for you?
Do you think it's going to be a cold night tonight or a hot night?
Alright, you keep it on.
You want yours off?
Ca n't find the trousers.
Well I ca n't find Tim's trousers at all.
There you are.
Well you try and get those on while I just put these on the right way round.
I should sit down to the job Tim and you wo n't fall over.
That's good.
And the other one in.
You're trying to put them in the same leg darling.
Try again.
There you are.
Whoops.
Do your teeth next.
You've got more teeth than Christopher at the moment have n't you?
Ah, ca n't you get him his toothbrush you rotten thing?
You're a bit mingy.
Ooh.
That's a bit mingy.
How are you doing Tim?
Right.
Whoops, in the dark.
Put the light on.
Has anybody had a wash?
Has anybody had a wash?
Well you look a bit mucky.
Was it a wash without any water?
I'll give you a quickie round the face.
There you go.
Whoops.
Just wait a minute.
Well I've got to make you look respectable for going to bed with, have n't I?
Who knows what you might meet in the night.
There you go.
What about you?
What do you look like?
Breakfast in the morning, yes.
No, it's just kind of warmish.
Have you been to the toilet?
Yes no yes no yes no, no?
Come here.
This is called a towel.
We dry ourselves on a towel.
Right.
I'm gon na run you over on your.
I do n't think he will.
He's just pretending.
An aeroplane's coming down the stairs?
Come on then.
Listen I do n't think that's too good an idea cos of the duvet.
I think you'll be going to bed in that soon and if you mess it up then you'll never sleep.
Come on, it's all very well in the mornings but not now I do n't think.
Because when you get into bed it will be all out.
Cos I have to erm change your sheets and things.
Because if you start messing your duvet up at night times it means that you do n't want to sleep underneath it cos it goes all scrunchy and horrible, and all the duvet bit comes out of the cover.
It's not a good idea.
Oop, here comes Ellie now.
Right.
Are you going to let them in, whoever they are?
Hello!
Is it Ellie?
It is Ellie.
Come in Ellie.
That's okay.
We've got to go and collect Dianne as well.
By the way.
Dianne rang up just now, you've got to go erm and collect her please cos er Barry's not gon na come home till half seven.
He's gon na come in the car and she does n't fancy walking in the night.
Have you got all that?
You ca n't touch me can you cos of my wires.
Yes?
It's all in there.
Do n't worry.
Mm.
One day you can.
You what?
Just let's think what we're doing first.
Let's tell Ellie what she's got ta do and what she's not gon na do.
Basically they go to bed about half seven, if you're lucky.
Well you know.
And erm they've done their teeth and they've had a wash and they've done everything really so all you've got to do is get them in there.
They usually they usually have a prayer before they go to sleep, right?
They usually do one and you do one as well.
And then and then erm, what happens then?
That's it then.
Oh the stories.
I forgot about stories.
We have the stories first usually before you and they're allowed two stories each and if they have any more then it's up to you.
. But they choose their own stories so you And if you, it looks like it's going to be an exceedingly long story you can.

Yeah, we can get started on that anyway, sort of thing before we Erm should the house go up in smoke, Theresa across the road run to her.
Otherwise if erm if you desperately need us sort of thing if you ring the vicarage and then you can erm Alison or somebody will probably be in and come round for.
You what?
Have I been breaking that?
Probably.
I did n't mean to.
It just sort of happened.
Okay, there's your emergency phone number if you're desperate.
As long as there's somebody in.
Where shall I put it?
Stick it up here.
Television works as it works.
Coffee pot works as it works.
Help yourself to the books and everything else as you like, yeah, in case you get bored.
Just do your own thing.
What wo n't work?
Well there's probably something catching on it.
There's probably something catching on it.
Right, what did I need to take with me?
Bible.
Andy can you bring my bible downstairs.
The blue one near the bed.
Figures.
Yeah.
I should go and get the other box and then you've got all the other bits and pieces as well.
Near the window.
Oh one where the toys are.
I think they're gon na be perfectly happy there.
I should n't worry about stories and stuff.
I think they will just get on and get themselves she can just lay the law down.
Cos it wo n't matter if they're not in bed till late will it, tonight?
Thing is we could do with a lie in in the morning.
What else do we need?
Been having fun?
You have.
Tell her again cos she were n't listening.
It's good this is n't it?
You can do it, you do n't have to do it in a great long line, you can do it in a sort of cube or something.
Oh right.
Yeah that'd be good that cos I I think I've only ever made that once and it was sort of a bit peculiar when you make it.
Oh no.
I do n't think I got that on the top like that.
Did I?
You making a mess?
Just a gentle sort of mess.
You know what I mean?
Tim's idea of a mess is to put his hands in it and got shooooo.
with it on the way.
Yeah look that that's a good idea look.
Not a good idea.
Erm I'd better get you biscuits and coffee and stuff like that out had n't I, to ply you with?
Do n't you keep away.
Tim, can I put this on you before we go.
Tim, just come with me up to the toilet for a minute.
Just leave that, cos she'll save it for you.
Well no, Ellie could oh, he's taking it with him.
Do you need to wee at all, Tim?
Right well just lie down here so we can put your nappy on before we go to bed.
Well done.
Come here.
So far so good.
We've got to pick up Diana as well.
On our on our travels.
Well, I am nearly.
She seems alright I think.
It's alright is n't it?
I know.
Think it was with a bit of Ellie's assistance that it got made like that.
Christopher's very good at doing the flat ones but not so good at the three D ones.
Right then.
We're all ready for off?
Have a nice time.
Yeah we're supposed to be back sort of, well we do n't know do we really?
Half nine it finishes so we're supposed to be back by tennish I should think by the time we're finished.
Oh have you?
With Martin?
Ignore her.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Is this the new neighbours?
Oh that's nice is n't it?
Martin does.
Oh.
Right then we'll see you.
Night night.
Do you want a kiss?
Do you want a kiss Tim?
Does he like it?
Does he?
Ah.
I've already given him one actually.
No, you do n't want another one from me do you?
Night night.
Have a nice time.
Yeah, it was nice.
Oh look, the moon.
Oh, you gon na wave us off?
Right.
Have I got my keys?
Yes.
Allow me madam.
Of course.
Ooh All aboard.
Who put down the side down there look?
Oh no, it's.
What's he doing look?
Looks like a.
You mean the children?
Oh yes, I think they will.
If erm oh yes I forgot about Ellie not looking happy.
Well I just kind of was running round the shop because I was.
I had to go and collect grandma you see to take her to the station, and I did n't have an awful lot of time so I just sort of ran round and collected whatever I got.
What, miss the train?
She'd have to get the next one.
Mm?
Daddy's got the marge.
Mm our daffodils are coming out nicely.
I hope the wind does n't blow them over.
Be a pity.
Oh where?
Oh yeah.
We'll have to go and collect it, put it in a vase on the side.
There look.
Mm.
The others seem to have stood up quite well over on the other side.
Which one's dead?
Mm.
See what you mean.
It is.
Looks as if it and the wind's got it again.
No.
Still, we can always pick them and bring them inside.
Mm.
It will be dead by now.
You're talking about last year are n't you?
Last year's flowers are n't around now.
These are the same bulbs though that have made a new flower this year.
They do it, well they do it every year.
The daffodils over there in that little bed seem to be a bit later than all the others, I do n't know.
I'd of thought they would have got just as much sun and rain as everything else.
Mm.
Very posh.
Candles.
What do you want me to do?
Oh good.
What do you want?
Do you want some er marmite on it?
Mm.
Gone a funny shape.
True.
Lot of things daddy has n't seen.
Inspector Morse.
No.
. We'll have to have another one next Wednesday.
Are they on every week or are they once a fortnight?
Mm.
Rosie and Jim mm.
They go to Stratford.
It was quite good actually.
Pardon?
The skin?
Is he?
I do n't know.
I did n't watch it that closely.
Have some more tea.
Mhm.
No.
They were in the audience shouting and cheering from what I saw.
Then they went round the back though did n't they?
Did they?
Nobody mentioned that they were puppets themselves.
Mm.
It was nice to see Stratford.
I wonder if that they filmed that at the time when the boat was in Stratford.
Do you remember when we went to.
we nearly went to see it but we missed.
Cos it had moved by the time we got there.
Mm.
It could well have been.
Well it's always takes a long time.
They they do these things months beforehand.
And then it comes on the television later on.
Mm.
Oh yes, that's right.
He was.
Oh.
He was certainly into canals in a big way.
Mm.
You'll have to get to know i is he in your?
Oh Solihull.
What was he called?
Jonathan.
He was a pleasant chap I thought.
As these chaps go.
Oh right.
How's Julia?
Well, it's not.
surprising.
Did you tell her?
Oh.
Well since someone else switched it off I should think.
When?
Oh.
No, cos it's not got the aerial it would do.
It would do.
It's not got the aerial in.
Should n't.
Oh.
What's on the video?
Yeah.
Right.
Right.

Well it might as well stay there.
Well it can hear us all then.
No, just remembered and rushed off and ge to get it.
The fridge made some really weird noises yesterday.
I thought oh what's going on.
Can I see you?
There's a little bit more just there.
Yeah.
Is it knocking on something?
Oh.
On the top.
On the top.
In other words mummy, clean your fridge.
Right.
Hands now.
Let me have a look.
That's that's not bad.
Other one.
That looks a bit sticky that one, at the back, does it?
No?
You're going to watch Rosie and Jim dear.
That's alright.
I'll wash up.
It's PC Pinkerton anyway, it's not even Rosie and Jim.
Oh.
Well wind it back ten minutes.
Can you do that, do you know how to do that?
Well I ca n't now it's too late.
Something weird is happening there.
How are you anyway?
Tired, yeah.
That figures.
You looked a bit gormless last night.
We all looked so over.
I know.
I know.
I did n't want to just sit and.
I know.
Well normally everybody chats.
I know.
At least we'd arrived.
What?
I can play.
What do you want me to do?
What, what have I got to do?
I do n't mind.
It's the morning, I can cope..
Oh alright.
Yes, fine.
What are we tinkling?
I'll cope, do n't worry.
I do n't feel worried.
I do n't feel worried.
I'm in friends.
I've never seen you in a suit before Barry.
Oh.
I must say when I got up this morning I did n't feel much better than when I went to bed last night but there we are.
I feel a bit more with it now.
It's since I've met people you know, they all seem jolly.
It's a shame that, is n't it?
Have to change your job again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you could just bring it here.
Yeah.
Like if you came straight out, what sort of time would you get home then?
You know, if it was sort of five minute's stroll down the road?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh here he is look.
We're alright.
Nothing personal twice.
I need paper.
Oh.
This is n't a very good piece of paper.
What are we singing then?
Oh.
What is it that we do n't know?
What do n't we know?
Six o one?
Oh right.
Wait a minute.
Oh I bet it's five nine eight.
I do n't know.
I'm just guessing.
That would seem to be the sort of thing he was humming.
But then Geoff would know that would n't he?
Yes.
Where's Philip?
Is he with us?
Oh.
Is he working?
Oh no.
Is he in work then?
All night?
Oh right.
At least somebody's got some work to do.
That's good innit?
Oh right.
So he had to go and clear up.
That's a good one.
That will do Geoff, for our singing.
You are.
There must be one that set you up.
Oh.
Wrong again.
Why ca n't I have an egg?
Yes.
Well that's okay, and that's Christopher's.
I'll have an egg without an egg cup.
Well I can have it and just peel it.
I mean take the take the skin off it.
Why do n't you come in the sitting room with me away from daddy?
And leave Christopher doing a bit of drawing.
Have you had a nice time this morning?
What did you do?
Alright then.
Shall we do it together?
This is nice actually.
It's like when you.
Why?
Alright then.
Hello.
Which shelf?
Right.
I'll see what I can do.
These ones?
Well you can have them all and put the black in when you need it.
Oh excuse me.
I'm coming.
I ca n't be in two places at once.
Cut the paper off.
It seems a shame to break it up does n't it, when it's so good.
Who made this one?
Oh yeah.
Was it la.
last night when you went to bed?
That was nice.
Did you enjoy that?
Did you like it?
This one?
It's a bit stiff.
There you are.
Do n't know, you have to sort of wobble them.
When you wobble them they come off.
Oop.
Oh.
There we are.
Right.
What shall we make this time?
How shall we start?
A house?
Right.
Is that the floor?
Have you got a story?
Oh.
The foundations.
That one about building the house?
Oh.
Right.
How's that?
We need some more walls.
Oh that's a good one.
A big tall one.
Let's try that shall we?
Shall we put a roof on?
How do you do the roof?
That way do you think?
Then we'll make it come down now this side.
Are you doing some more whoops a daisy.
If you're going to make it go out that way then you'll have to make it go out that way at the bottom otherwise it wo n't fit when you try to put the other wall up.
And the problem with that one is is it's not sort of fitting the edge there.
Then this comes down the side look.
Oh no, that's not right.
Look at that it's got things sticking out.
Do you think you've got to have it down the edge there, have n't you?
This time.
And how do we fix this on now?
And could we take this yellow one off we'll find it fits in like a wall, like that look.
try that.
That's good.
Oh.
Oops.
There you are.
Now what are we gon na do with this yellow piece?
Wonder if we can put that on the bottom, ca n't we somewhere?
Yeah.
This does n't feel quite right here somehow.
It's all wobbly.
Shall we, just let's see if we can turn this round so it makes it.
When Ellie did it it did n't seem to fall to pieces like ours is Timothy.
Think the eggs probably are but I do n't think the whole lunch is yet.
Are you hungry?
I think we might manage that.
I do n't mind burnt toast.
Adds to the flavour.
Mm.
Me mum and dad seem to have had trouble with their toaster do n't they?
Judging by their letter.
Mm.
It was a new one.
Where they had it?
Why they had it.
Well we had it in the evening.
You know when I used to have my.
toast and marmalade and.
But that was where the trouble was because it did n't toast properly.
Because you turned it up to number five and it was pale.
And turn it down to number one and it.
I have n't had either.
They're planning on taking it back so.
It's called Edam.
We do n't usually have Edam do we?
He's got cream cheese on there dear.
Right, what's on the agenda for this afternoon then?
It looks like a sandwich going up and down to me.
Oh.
I dunno really.
My body feels inactive, but my mind feels fed up,.
Potter about.
And that dozen in our garden ca n't decide which way to face.
Have you noticed?
Cos in the morning they get the sun from that direction, then they do n't see the sun again for a bit and then it turns up suddenly from over there.
They do n't know whether to face over there or over there.
Hello.
Did you?
I do n't know why.
Monday? questions.
Questions on Monday.
Well they were meant to go in a chicken but it never happened.
I was going to do chicken a l'orange.
But you were n't here so I thought ooh, blow this for a lark.
Mm.
Good idea.
One each?
They're huge.
We'll be having half each.
Mm.
Because they're rather large.
Do you want to peel them?
Okay.
Mm?
Your friend am I?
That's nice.
We're all friendly together.
Oh that's friendly family.
I do like everyone, yes.
I like everybody very much.
Those satsumas we had or whatever they were clementines were they were quite nice for tea all this week.
Have you had one?
Oh.
Oh no we've never had that problem.
Did you have one at school with lots of pips in?
Oh.
Beg your pardon.
Very wise.
I would think the oranges will have pips in wo n't they?
Usually do.
Mm.
Orange pips are slightly bigger than satsuma pips so you can see them.
That's alright.
You spit it out again did you?
Do other people get satsumas at school?
Yeah.
No?
What do they have?
Just check there's no pips Tim.
Just as well innit?
Seeing's you've eaten it.
Whoops careful.
Just go slowly Tim.
Cos they're big slices, it's not like satsumas.
Do n't they?
Mhm.
They leave the skin on?
You do n't have to eat the skin, surely?
And you have to suck it out?
Oh.
That's probably cos it would take them too long to peel everybody's oranges would n't it?
Oh.
Do you have Mrs and Mrs then with your class? mm just Mrs.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Ah I see, right.
So two classes come together and you all, each have a dinner lady?
And yours is Mrs.
Theirs is Mrs.
Got it now.
Mm.
Well put it that bit then in there.
And mine.
Nice taste.
It is.
Got more faff.
What else is there?
You might find some biscuits in the biscuit tin.
Oh.
See what daddy finds.
Mum I did n't like did I?
I did n't have a home made one because I had a very funny tummy did n't I?
But I have n't had one once and it tasted really nice.
Cloth by the sound of the water.
We're going to have a cloth by the sound of the water.
Can you pass me a cup please?
Thank you.
Where's he going?
Toilet?
He's only had three drinks.
You definitely pay the penalty do n't you, for leaving your children?
Cos other people say you do n't do things your way.
It must be a problem if people sort of leave their children in nurseries all the time cos it's nice for a short time but for a long long time they're just not yours are they any more?
Yeah.
It seems a pity but it's not for very long.
He has yeah.
That's why I'm feeling as if I ought to stay in tonight really.
What do you think?
Think I'm just chickening out?
I am chickening out cos I do n't feel as if I've learnt an awful lot.
Well do you want to chicken out?
Instead.
Why?
Why?
You've said you'll go.
Just because you've said you'll go or because you think?
And do you think I ought to go then?
Well I mean there might well be something.
gripping and of interest but at the same time my priorities at this moment.
It does n't seem very fair.
Him.
You alright?
Oh it's here it's wet.
I wondered what that was there.
Must be the oranges do you think? tipped out of your.
Mm.
It is with this one.
I have n't seen him for two days.
I might feel differently by five o'clock mind you.
That's true.
You've had six million biscuits already.
Good gracious.
What is Rosemary thinking of?
And I'll be telling Rosemary what I think of her biscuit trips.
Why, what happened yesterday?
Oh yes, she gave you a lolly did n't she?
And your teeth will be dropping out.
Mm.
Was n't that what it was?
Did n't you get a l a chewy lolly or something on a stick?
From that girl that he's had.
Was n't that what you came home with?
No?
What treat?
Was there another one then?
Oh, Ellie.
Well she did n't give you anything to eat.
She gave you a drink did she before you went to bed?
Oh.
No wonder they were soaked of a night.
Yeah, go on.
Oh.
We've run short of blackcurrant.
Thank you mister tom tom player.
You know when these people came to school and played instruments, how many of them were there?
Hard work.
No not quite.
No, cheeks there.
There's loads on your cheeks.
I do n't know what it is.
Eight.
A lot of them then?
Gosh.
Eight people came?
Oh goodness.
I did n't realize that many.
I thought it would be just two or three people.
Right that cheek's fine.
Now try the other cheek Tim.
A cello.
No, bit more.
Clarinet?
Bit more.
Erm here.
Oh right.
Was anybody on a drum?
Or anything like that?
A little you know.
Listen you're not even tidied up yet.
Come round here and I'll sort that cheek out for you cos you've still missed it.
Scrub it hard.
No, you're still missing it.
Bit further nearer your ea that's it.
Go on now try, no too far back.
That's it, try there.
Better.
What are your hands like?
Okay.
Can you take your bib off then?
Can you take that in the kitchen please cos it is biscuits, actually.
Correct.
Timothy!
Timothy, that is not a drum, that is a biscuit barrel.
Please take it in the kitchen.
Thank you.
What sort of paper?
What for?
To draw on?
I'll see what we can find.
With felt tip?
I think you're gon na get the felt tip on your hands.
We can find some dressing up things.
That's it.
And where shall we sign it again?
Erm yes I should think so.
I should think this is her friend, do n't you think?
Oop oh look at.
Hat.
Look at the.
Well you've got le- and you've got li-.
That's it.
Look at this lovely hat.
What's she trying on?
That's it.
Shoes.
Look at my shoes.
Ha looks funny now.
Pretty.
Beads.
Mhm.
Look at these lovely beads.
What are those things in your ears, do you know?
Earrings.

Princess.
I do n't know.
Just a princess.
You look like a princess.
So she looks like a princess and she looks like her mum.
Mm.
Oh here comes dad.
I do n't know really.
I think the idea is that you just, they show you who's doing the speaking by putting it in that little bubble from the person and then they write it again at the bottom.
I do n't know why.
You do n't have to say it twice if you do n't want to.
You can just read this bit if you like.
We're.
Tamla.
Liz is.
You are.

Oh, that's it.
Well that was fun.
Now let's see if we can do these.
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
If you look at that bit, you know who that is do n't you?
That's you.
Middle name.
Market.
Did you?
Oh right.
Fine, market.
And what's that's the number two remember.
Well done.
I think you know all those do n't you?
I'll pick any one of these, see if you can read it to me are you ready?
This one.
I think you'll know those do n't you, when Mrs asks you?
Hopefully she'll be back in school on Monday.
She was n't there on Monday was she?
What else have we got in here?
We've got some plastic bags.
A very fine acrobat.
It needs a bit of sellotape there does n't it?
Do you want to sellotape him up?
I like this bit.
Oh I like his mouth.
That's good.
How did you do that?
Mm.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh yes I see.
Yeah.
We could do.
If you get it st erm stuck down properly we can.
How did you get this stick then?
Did you have to saw this stick?
That's good innit?
Which end did you saw?
This bit?
Mm.
I thought it would be that one cos you'd be a bit wobbly would n't you with your sawing?
Or were you straight with your sawing?
Right.
You clamped it down did you?
You need some sellotape just there round that arm.
On that hand.
Away you go.
See what you can do.
No that one's alright, that one's stuck.
It's just this one.
Mm very good.
We can hang it up.
We could hang it over the stairs instead of that fish.
We'll take the fish down put the clown up instead.
Whoops.
Oh, beg his pardon.
The acrobat up instead.
No, not really.
Ooh!
It would be better if he was stuck on properly.
Then we could swing him over.
Another sticking session.
I've lost my cup of coffee.
What did I do with it?
It was when you were playing with it with your fingers, do you remember?
Anyway it wo n't matter.
We can use some pliers or something to bend it back.
Hello hello hello hello.
Yes.
For for the chilly days.
Well in the summer you wo n't need jumpers will you like this?
Hopefully.
If we have a good summer.
Mind you in the evening, if it gets quite chilly in the evenings so it might be a good jumper to wear in the evenings when we go for our evening walks by the sea.
Oh what a lovely thought daddy.
Next time we go to the sea.
Oh it's the clip.
He's been playing with it, he's bent it out so it.
It's on at the moment though.
I tried doing it with my fingers but.
Thank you dear.
Very helpful.
Very helpful.
Oh.
Giving who something?
What do you mean?
Go on.
Give you what?
Why?
Oh I see.
Oh right.
No no.
Nothing to do with biscuits.
Er, I think we should.
Come on.
I think we should have chips, do n't you?
Erm I do n't know.
Have you got some money?
It's alright.
I've got loads of money somewhere.
It's just a matter of.
Oh well I saw that on Friday.
In fact yesterday we said I wonder if he's got a new car or whether he's got visitors.
Very posh is n't it?
Is it new?
I mean.
It's J reg is it?
I I I I told you to.
Will it fit in the garage?
Oh that's a point.
That's a bit tricky.
Well we think that that might be a new car.
We're not nearly there.
We have n't even started.
I did.
I was absolutely whacked out.
Well I have n't.
You've done all the meals.
Would n't be too bad cos you'd go down by the Jolly Farmer.
You'd have to walk like Gemma walks to school would n't you?
Gemma lives Oakenshaw.
She does actually.
Wonder if she goes to MacDonalds every night for her tea?
She could.
Mm.
Ooh there's a lot of cars.
There's not normally that many people there are there?
Oh it looks crowded.
Perhaps there's a party.
That's true.
I ca n't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to MacDonalds too often.
Everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is.
Let's got to MacDonalds for our tea.
Mm it is quite full though.
Course we are.
I've never known it that full before.
Well just keep going round.
There was some space at the other end actually.
I do n't think we did Tim.
No.
I think there's one just over here.
Oh.
There.
That's the one I saw when I was coming in.
Do n't know if you're meant to use it.
Are those erm queuing up though?
Oh.
Why?

See Ronald MacDonald in person here on Sunday the twenty second of March.
Appearances at noon and three PM.
I thought the man was dead.
Ronald MacDonald.
Is n't he dead, Ronald MacDonald?
Or perhaps it's sort of some dressed up character.
Okay.
Are you coming Christopher or are you going to sit here to have your meal?
Just wait Tim cos there's lots of cars.
Well just go and stand on that path there cos there's another another car then.
Stay on the path.
Wait! just there.
On that path, go on.
Right stay there, do n't move.
Yes.
Okay, right.
Away you go.
Yeah sit down.
Come on.
How many what?
I do n't know.
Yeah.
Twenty chicken nuggets please.
And er yeah tomato ketchup and sweet and sour please.
I can have two of each ca n't I?
And french fries.
Yeah two large.
And two teas two teas two oranges.
Erm that's it.
Would you not shout at me.
Do n't shout at me.
I do n't want a straw, no.
Right.
Thank you.
Yes, just go and sit with daddy please.
Now stop.
No.
No thanks.
Just milk.
Can you two go and sit down with daddy please cos this is getting silly.
No.
Go and sit with daddy.
Go and sit with daddy.
No cos you keep shouting at me.
Now go away, please.
Now please.
Go.
Go on please.
No.
I shall just say I'm sorry we do n't want this meal and we'll go away.
Go and sit down with daddy please.
french fries.
Say how many Smarties come in a thing.
I should n't imagine you were.
I should think there would be about dunno thirty normally.
It has has n't it?
Yeah it's got loads of holes.
Er you could do with something to hold it with or else you're gon na get into a terrible terrible mess.
Where did you put all the paper?
Right.
Well just have this round it.
I do n't know.
Depends how long you want for it to take.
Do you want a cup of tea daddy?
Another cup of tea, or a coffee?
It's not been on, no, I've just switched it on.
I think everything on this erm, machine is to do with food, do n't you?
You need to sort of stop and talk when you have food.
Yes please cup of tea are making it then? good!
I did manage to sort out the food for tomorrow and.
Well I thought.
Yeah.
I mean pinched one of for starters, that makes a difference.
No!
A pathetic film on, I do n't.
know what it was about, but it was pathetic!
Mm.
What's happening tomorrow?
Well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and things.
What is it tomorrow morning and evening, and what are we going to do in the afternoon without?
I know we'll cope but what are you going to do?
Are we inviting anyone?
I know we're not inviting anybody for lunch Christmas day could n't cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon ca n't cope with the people!
Well that's what I was thinking, perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere.
You know, like by a canal or something.
Perhaps, well if it's snowing it wo n't be quite the same.
Conducive to tripping about!
But if it's quite nice weather, it would be nice to invite somebody along I expect.
Stratford?
Is it six weeks since we saw the last one then?
Mm.
That's Mother's Day twenty second.
Is it?
No.
Twenty ninth.
Yeah they want a party piece on Tuesday.
It's alright you do n't have to, of cake.
If I do n't bake them now my mother.
Yeah I will.
And it better be a nice one!
Pop into Marks and Spencers they have some amazing shapes in Marks and Spencers that the children will enjoy.
Mind you it might be expensive.
Tesco's are probably cheaper.
You remember that Tom and Jerry I got for Tim?
Because I could n't be bothered to cook it.
Thank you dear.
Yeah.
And I'll just make the rest of the with salad in.
I've told you what we're gon na for Christopher have n't I?
Yeah.
Is that naughty?
Thursday morning.
You what?
On Monday?
Where are you going Monday?
Oh right the big housewife!
like cooking this week.
Ah, I'm having Jane for a piano lesson, are n't I?
Monday.
So that fits in quite well I could n't remember what I was doing on Monday but we said, sort of tentatively Monday would be probably quite a good day I think.
Better than Thursday anyway.
So could Tuesday night be Inspector Morse night?
Oh right can we not take her home?
Well she'll.
have been here all day, wo n't she?
So she might want to go home!
Could you tell her we're going to watch Inspector Morse!
I do n't think she watches it normally.
I bet she would, she loves anything like that!
Bit of a body!
Mind you, it might be too complicated!
Right.
If it was not Bradley Hall, it ca n't be Bradley Hall again, they're always going in there!
Mm.
And how did.
they get permission then?
Where is it?
Oh!
They do n't know where?
Oh.
So.
this was about last week's episode?
Oh.
We seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched before Wednesday.
Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow.
your dad.
Erm not it was n't about your dad, it was about my birthday cos.
he'd realized that it was my birthday, and wha, what did I want?
So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.
And last week cos she's quite generous is n't she?
No, I did n't say anything.
So your dad sent a cheque.
Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad, and she has heard from your dad apparently on Friday he went to the consultant.
and next week he's got his first well she did n't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now.
I do n't know how long it's going to go on for, or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see.
But at least things have moved, and at least they've gone round.
So I'm pleased really, are you?
Interesting that they've done it so quickly is n't it?
After seeing him, because he thought that once he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that.
Yeah.
Got ta get moving.
And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him has had tha, upset that thrombosis again.
I do n't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's too late tonight now.
Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up?
Well they love talking to them on the phone do n't they?
We could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they do n't get moaned down or something!
Bogged down!
I do n't know she just said.
a few times a week and I think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything.
Well I hope not I mean no he wo n't be able to drive.
but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere.
so I do n't see why they ca n't drive him!
I'm sure they will.
cos they're very good are n't they?
I mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church.
It would nice if we lived there but we ca n't so.
And write as well.
Double dose.
Well it's sort of pulled out, but at least it's.
And it's hard as well.
We've been paying anyway, so it must of you know.
What does erm you see er Eileen's and she's having chemotherapy is n't she?
By me, by medication, is.
that right?
That's right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then.
And that makes her feel what?
She's not in pain is she?
More sort of dopey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Difficult to know.
Oh yes, that was it!
I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we do n't really know how bad it is do we?
Perhaps he will be able to say, you know?
But whether he'd tell us over the telephone, you think ask.
I think he would would n't he?
Are you feeling alright before you sort of?
Oh I see.
Try again Tim!
Why should daddy have to go?
No get me up for it.
That bad is it?
Oh no we're not gon na take another tape off!
Sunday today.
It's a different.
Where do we normally go on Sunday?
Where do we normally go on Sunday?
There's scramblers today.
Mm have you seen your scrambler pads?
Cos I ca n't find it.
Mm.
Chris is going all weekend.
Get that.
You've done a lot of shouting today Chris!
Pardon?
You want a coat, why did n't use a coat, what you're wearing put it on Why do n't you get dressed?
You're not cold you just want to be cuddled.
Have you been to.
the toilet recently?
Try it!
Helps you feel better.
Oh good!
That's probably the trouble if you've been eating too much.
I think so.
If he does that.
Oh Good morning dear!
So nice to see you this morning.
Are you tired?
Well it's there!
Well I think you should get dressed rather than do that.
And then you can have, be covered up when you're dressed.
Cos then you'll be warmer, especially round your feet.
Go on then.
How have you managed to Marmite round your eye?
Mm look.
Did he look ill before he started on his breakfast daddy?
Oh!
Good!
No you did n't, or this week.

Whoops a daisy!
Rice Krispies on the floor!
If you suddenly feel sick, there's the bowl okay?
No, just leave it on the edge, he does n't want it up his nose!
That's it.

What's the matter?
Your jumper goes in, not the bottom drawer but the next drawer up.
You found it?
Oh good.

Put it in this one, that's the jumper drawer.

Oops!
Jumpers in that one, and then the bottoms in that one.
There's some more pyjamas where will they go?
Mhm.
I think there might be more pyjamas, I'll go and se.
Ca n't you?
If you leave that drawer open, I think there's more pyjamas to come so I'll get them for you.
There you are, there's the tops to the pyjamas.
Right.
Right, the same drawer that you put the jumper in that one goes in.
Mm.
Right, now then wait a minute!
The sock can go wi, the same as the jumper again.

Those are daddy's, okay?
Daddy's socks.

No that's the trousers that's it!
There's much there.
Yeah that's cos the drawers are a bit peculiar!
Right good I think we've done it now.
I think we have.
The rest is all ironing so we take that down to the ironing basket.
Alright?
Let's go and leave daddy in peace.
There's some paper in your.
bedroom.
There's some on the floor there look why do n't you take that downstairs, and use it.
On the floor.
Your boating one.
I do n't know which is your boati, oh I know, it's in my bedroom cos you were making mummies all over it.
Are you coming downstairs now?
You wan na lift what?
I'm not giving you a lift downstairs, come off it.
Why do n't you.
sit down, and bump down like you usually do.
when you want to go fast?
Oh!
Hello!
Are you still feeling pathetic!
I thought you might have recovered by now.
I thought you might have recovered by now.
Are you hurting?
Or are you just tired?
You're hurting.
Well I'm not coming up the steps, and lift you down the steps!
You're perfectly capable of coming down yourself!
Sit down on your bottom and I'll catch you at the bottom, right you ready?
On your marks get set bump! be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp be domp, got you!
Well done!
Aha aha!
You got a?
Daddy's note book ooh I should n't lose that!
Has that come out of his pocket?
It's probably got in it all his train numbers.
It's probably got all his train numbers in.
I do n't think these trees are gon na grow, do you?
Oh yes, I can see one little seed!
Hey look at this!
In here there's one very, very tiny little a sort of seedling coming up, can you see a little spark of green just there?
Just one.
Oh look there's another one!
Two.
Do n't know if you'll see it over there, I think you might have to be in the light.
Here look inside here it's meant to be bonsai trees but I do n't know whether I'll ever remem materialize.
Somebody gave us one for Christmas.
Can you see?
If you look very carefully you can just see a couple of little green shoots starting to come.
Oh.
I can see one in a big lump.
One in a big lot?
Hello!
Okay, can I feed the fish first, cos these poor fish have n't been fed yet.
I will!
I'll sit down, I'll sit down, just hold on!
Finish doing the jobs.
Well.
it's meant to be a bonsai tree which looks like a tree but it's only very small like that high.
But at the moment I think there's lots and lots of seeds.
I think there could be about fifteen trees in there, so far.
That fish came zooming up to the top then, to see what you were doing.
Now then Tim, not too much, alright?
These are fish, not sharks.
Go on.
Wah hey, look at that one, it must feel hungry!
Oh it's not too bad.
Only a tiny bit now, yeah.
That's it, go on then.
That's it, lovely!
Put the top on.
No, just put the top on.
What's the matter with you?
Why do n't we take that to the kitchen then, it'll be out of the way.
Mm.
Looks rather funny that, I think that lid's a little bit large do you?
The lid, do you think it's a bit large?
Oh, you think it's alright?
Yeah, hold on these poor fish are gon na be able to jump out of there if they need if they want to.
Ooh ah ah ah!
Mm, they're probably used to it by now!
Come on.
Ow!
My toe!
Right, what are we drawing?
I think you need to go to the toilet do n't you?
Yes oh dear, if.
it's not one thing it's another!
It's just damp actually.
No, I just think.
it's just sort of started.
Well let's wee first shall we?
Right.
It was a good job I noticed, was n't it?
Would you of noticed?
Mm?
Orgh!
Got you!
I like sitting on this one.
You can bring it here I've got sat down now, I ca n't cope, I'm too old!
Go on.
You're not going to draw first, no?
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, your aeroplane's upstairs.
Do you want to do it?
Off you go then.
What, make the aeroplane?
That's it.
A cooker!
Colour, right okay.
Are you going to get some pencil crayons to do.
it with?
So instead.
of getting ordinary crayons because.
I think you should just get pencil crayons cos otherwise we'll never be able to use them.
Pardon?
Rosemary's got some Lego?
Oh that's nice.
Oh lovely!
Actually.
those wo n't be any use will they Tim?
Can you see those up there in the those will be the best.
Shall I come and help you cos I do n't think you ought to s.
Ca n't reach there.
Oh right.
Or even better look, these ones these will be best for our job.
Shall we do it at the table?
Do you want to go and get your aeroplane, cos I can sit at the table and colour with one hand, and make aeroplanes with the other.
No, his aeroplane.
Right, are we ready?
Here's somebody going to the dentist in this book.
Do you darling?
Oh dear!
Are you coming Tim?
What you doing?
Ca n't hear you properly, do n't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I'm not listening properly.
I ca n't hear you love, you'll have to come and talk to me in here.
Cos Tim's talking to me as well, and I'm not being that clever.
That's broken that one.
Tell me again, tell me about Christopher in the playground.
You were in.
the playground.
Oh right.
On purpose!
Well I do n't, I presume it was n't.
Mind you, if you were going the same way as he wanted go, and he was going the way you wanted to go.
and nobody wanted to move, then you would bang, and it.
would be both people's fault.
You do need a bin, you're right, it's over there.
Well that's.
what he was doing too.
I'll look after those.
And while you're at it with the bin get yourself a tissue as well, to wipe your nose.
The trouble is, you see, if Christopher's doing what he wants to do, you're doing what you all want to do and then both both of you crash in the middle it's nobody's fault particularly is it?
Well what you've got to do, you've both got to learn.
You've both got to learn.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh there we go.
I suspect that one day, you'll both learn to look where you're going and both move out of the way.
So nobody is to back.
Are you going to get that aeroplane?
Ah you've already wiped your nose, you've wiped it over your cheek!
Yuk!
Urgh, what a mess!
Right, what are we doing now, sharpening this?
Shall I help you?
Cos I do n't.
think you're getting very far are you?
Did you put it back in his pocket?
No.
I think you should, do you?
Hello dear.
Are you sorted?
What books?
Well no, cos they're all in the pile love somewhere.
Did n't did n't include what?
Oh it does n't what you.
what you mean the.
I do n't care what it was, it was just kind of, you know, a story that they might know.
just happened to be the children's, that's all.
I suppose as long as you bring them back, it wo n't matter.
As long as they do n't want to borrow them.
Cos I thought it was n't very fair to lend out the children's stuff.
I suppose for hours cos I had loads from when I was teaching so wi that, I've donated those cos our own children would never get to mark them.
Oh well ma, we were considering ooh we got a green Jesus here!
Is little girl still in bed, oh well we'll make her food up shall we?
blue, are they?
Actually I do n't think they are really you know!
Do I look blue?
We have blue clothes sometimes.
do n't you?
You do n't usually have a blue.
Cos you do n't usually have a blue face!
Still, when you're drawing, you can draw anything really.
Might have a red dress oh it's pyjamas I suppose, if they're in bed or a nightie?
Try and give her a red nightie.
No, that's supposed to be what he's thinking look he's got little blobs coming from his head.
Cos he's thinking about Jesus.
I think he's going to the dentist or something, and he's a bit frightened so he thinks, he thinks of that.
What's the matter Christopher?
No.
That's fair enough.
Do want some lemonade then?
Daddy!
Yep.
Hello do you want to come and join us?
Do you need the toilet?
Do you want to switch the telly off then?
I should stay lying down if I were you.
Dizzy?
Well lie down.
Do you?
I would of thought you'd of been better if you just well just sit down then love.
Shall I switch this to go?
Still there.
There you go.
Just drink it gently now.
Do you think you're gon na be sick again?
I'll and get you a box.
I did n't realize they had got so one of these, I should bought some more should n't I?
Ah?
Open.
It's a good job grandma's away really is n't it?
Cos she'll be.
happy to see you being sick!
What have you done all morning then?
I suppose it was n't really that much of a morning by the time you got home again.
What?
You're not having a earlier?
Oh they have it early in the morning, about half nine or something.
Must of been desperate!
How to keep them happy.
Well our little group of six was very nice.
Very clever.
Erm a new girl called Jadie.
and Samantha.
Samantha do n't worry and Paul Paula who was very sweet, and told us about when her parents split up Reece who was also very sweet and erm Paula.
who turned out to be able to read quite a lot.
Mm cos we decided it was n't worth splitting into two groups, everybody else.
Mm.
I had her anyway, just in case.
No.
She's quite happy.
We just did what we were supposed to do really ha ha we actually read the first one of the quests together, so it was good you know, we decided what to do how to do it.
They all one kind or another.
Well.
There's plenty of adult books that can be used, still.
But seems a pity does n't it?
On that.
Well, eat up eat up the broccoli then.
No I do n't want you.
Oh!
Put that down please, and cut it into pieces.
Timothy, that is disgusting!
There's too much when you do that.
Well it's only horrible cos you've put too much of it in your mouth at once.
Just have little pieces of it.
Looks as though there's gon na be no pudding unless you do!
I think you're just being a bit too silly with your food!
Eat that bit.
There.
And eat it properly this time!
There was only two of them in scramblers.
Mm very.
low day today.
No they.
But no, no there was a lot of adults there but obviously not families.
And one or two had farmed on their children out over there, like you know, the.
and made a family.
They seemed to be a there in it's entirety and erm Graham and Kirsty, they were away with their gran.
Oh very jolly, yes, they enjoyed that.
What, sat.
next to them, yeah?
Erm he was speaking and I think she was singing!
No.
Everybody seemed alive this morning.
you know, sometimes people, sort of, look as if they've just got out of bed!
Probably they had!
They seemed sort of keen and enthusiastic today.
That's nice.
it sort of inspires everybody to be keen and enthusiastic then.
There seem to be large quantities of path finders going up and down like those.
Mm.
Well, I asked them you know, and they said.
oh yes, it went very jollily.
Well I'm not surprised when it's been in your mouth, and then you threw it out again!
You were a bit silly to put it all in at once, were n't you really?
Keep, your legs, what love?
Your legs are hurting you?
Where is it hurting, just your legs?
Do you think you ought to go back to bed?
Does your head hurt?
Your head, ache.
You cold?
He's sweltered actually!
He's got a temperature.
Well some of us have got spoons here.
Here.
Christopher does n't need one.
Have a good cough, see if you can spit it up, whatever's.
If it comes out of your mouth spit it out, rather than let it go back down to your tummy.
Right get them out.
Thank you.
Going places?
Where you going?
Let me switch this thing off, it seems.
a bit silly having it on when we're trying to.
Is there?
There's supposed to be two there!
Oh a bit worrying, there's only one, we must of lost one.
What?
I thought you only got one?
Oh I see, you got two yellows.
You can have those yellows if you like.
Right can you pass the not being very well.
Okay.
I do n't think it will take much to count mine!
One, two, three.
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
I'm gon na guess, I'm gon na use the.
I'm gon na guess it's thirty two.
Forty two!
Oh must of mis, misread it then there's probably sixty in the pack, not fifty!
Forty two!
I think you've won.
No.
Ooh no no he ca n't cope!
Shall we.
Stay here.
I'll put those back.
in the bag.
Do you want another game of caterpillars, or a different game?
Another game of that.
True!
The bag's behind you there.
Right.
You need a tissue.
! I'm just kind of, stuck here!
Mm?
Yeah.
I guessed thirty two cos I thought there was in the pack.
Cor that's a good blow, you're getting good.
at blowing your nose, yeah, screw it all up and wipe the rest of your nose clean now.
That no.
that's not a good place!
Either stick it in your pocket for later.
yes it's working away.
Either.
stick it in your pocket for next time or put it in the bin.
Good question actually.
Aha!
He was gon na record the.
Right daddy, are you coming down to play or are you at least you've got the table.
Think I could do with a table cos this one's really.
Thanks.
I think so.

circle.
Are you going to play Tim?
No, he's not gon na play just wants to sit with.
We'd better bring the contraption with us.
That's fixed up.
Hang on a sec, take the microphone as well there.
Who does?
Alright Tim, we'll just sit him down again in a different place.
Oh that's better got some pins and needles in my knees.
Can we sit down like that Tim?
Oh very well then, like that.
What have we got?
Blue and red.
You ca n't wake up be too tired!
Tired.
I'm red okay?
I do n't know that's the way you should do.
Ah oh!
It does n't matter does it?
No I would n't, cos I might have picked up a different thing.
That's funny!
I'll get to do those.
that will be even better!
Blue.
Blue and red.
Thank you.
Mhm.
Green.
Could this be it daddy?
Could I be pinching yours?
Red.
No, wrong way round Oh it's brightening up the weather a bit now.
Pity we could n't go for a romp round a canal is n't it?
I just fancied a romp round the canals today!
Yeah would of been alright.
Are you trying to tell me I would n't of liked it if I'd gone?
Red and green daddy that's.
Makes a change from the caterpillar eating our flowers!
No, I do n't think they are.
at the moment.
Well, I found hundreds.
and hundreds of, you know baby things lurking under the leaves.
But they've all gone cos every time you rake up the leaves you throw away another fifty.
Particularly at the front, there were hundreds!
Little grubs, you know?
still covered blue.
red do one red please?
Oh no, it's the other way round, yes do a red please?
Ca n't reach what love?
Yellow and blue daddy oh no, it's the other way round yes it is.
Red and blue?
That's not very clever if you do n't mind me saying so!
This one seems to be perking up a bit,.
He'll probably collapse bedside I hope this does n't mean we're gon na have a se, a week of this!
Could do with a good faith if it's not one it's in the last.
place is it?
Have you?
Where are you off to, to the office?
I know you for dinner.
To do what?
Eight o'clock!
That's a bit anti-social, seven.

Why do they want to make a meeting at eight o'clock?
What is it for?
Oh look at that!
Red, green red, green, red, green, red green, daddy there's no.
caterpillar left on mine!
Look at that, I've only got four left!
You wait, I'll get to you and then you'll be sniggering the other side of your face!
Ha!
A blue, there's blue.

Could be getting the.
Oh daddy!
I consider that very anti-social!
I know I'm back to four little pieces!
Mhm.
Not a red!
Please!
Aha!
It's ages since we played this game, I'd forgotten how clever at it he can be particularly when you're not!
Yes, they do that.
He's very hard to actually know what they're supposed be like certainly around, but not round my ears.
Blue and red has somebody got blue and red, daddy?
What's that one there, is that, oh it's just green.

Ah that's looking a bit better!
No!
Mm mm Why do n't you just.

Right do n't get anything for me please, green and red.

Ooh!

Whoops a daisy!
That's made a mess of table!
The caterpillar's going into the microphone!
Excuse me microphone, could you just move!
Green and blue there, you can have one of mine if you like.
Just make it twist round at the side and then it wo n't touch it.
Daddy, has got the shortest!
Is it me now?
Ca n't be many left can there?
Yellow and green.
Only one from you dear just seems like a lot.
cos there's not much of your caterpillar left!
I'll move these as well.
Pinch dad's, pinch the tail off yours as well you have n't got much to arrange anyway!
Bit of long one, but it might all disappear in one foul swoop when somebody takes these out of here your go please darling?

Is it?.
If you've got your as what?
Oh I see yeah.
Bad results and redundancies.
But I mean if you're puking up everywhere you ca n't obviously go into work can you?
It's not as if you can stagger in like when you've got a heavy cold, at least.

Well, you'll have to be very better tomorrow before we went swimming.

I'll leave you to it.

Hello!
We're here again!
It's alright do n't worry about it.
It's all to do with language in the nineteen nineties Jean.
And this man came to the door, and he went to get the hold belt, that should just have a tape recorder on conversation just throughout the week so it's getting all sorts of rubbish going in there,.
and it's all do with erm you know people and the erm wives and language of the nineties.
So I get a free twenty five pound worth of Marks and Spencers erm gift vouchers which.
Yeah.
I'll do anything for money and chocolate!
What have you got?
Actually it must be quite interesting looking at the development of language as time goes on.
It'll be interesting in the year two thousand and ninety to look back and see what we used to do in the nineteen nineties.
Well you wo n't.
be around but it'll be fascinating cos you'll be recorded for life June!
And I'll.
Oh!
Say something sensible.

Alright.
It varies considerably you can have eight you can up to fourteen except fifteen why, how many do you want in?
Right.
Invite.
Getting a bit long?
I'd invite them.
old! of having it!
It's more cosy!
And at home.
If she wants her sister,.
When is it?
Can we go?
I know that, but will you make it stick.
No,!

But I'll find them, and you wo n't have any bother.
Actually it's quite a cosy group, so they probably know each other by.
now then.
Looks a bit agitated!
Telling everyone about her mum and dad when they and erm how she talked to her mum about that, and it helped her.
Are they moving to to be with someone else or.
Well.

I hate being sick and one thing another well, it turned out.
Sophie was supposed to be doing the chorus so I grabbed Mary, and said come with me on the half way through, called Sophie why are you doing all the talking Dot and not Mary!
Cos she's supposed to be Andy!
So, Sarah had a job to do, but it was n't, sort of, till the end, and we're gon na finish too quickly because normally we have it like Paul and Helen being really with it and look there's sort of upward.
and then down below there's Helen you know Christopher and.
then Laura's with him.
But none of them turned up to today so.
Mm cos she'll see you there.
Who else is there with her in there?
They're all.
Why not!
Well I'm glad of that my children cos all.
mine are like that,.
and it does mean that they can relax you know about work and everything.
cos you know they're a million times ahead.
Yeah have n't got to worry.
No!
But friends means such a lot do n't they, at that age?
Oh right yeah.
We've got, we've still not got it yet!
Well we had, we had it two weeks ago.
They were away.
But when she gets back.
I do n't know, I must talk to Marilyn about it.
Shame really.
There again it's if we give.
we'll give.
we're giving it to her.
Oh yes, I do n't feel she's despised in any way.
Your clothes are in here some of them.
Seem to have clothes scattered everywhere in this house at the moment!
It is a busy.
What's exactly?
Yeah we do n't need that today, you do n't need that till Friday, so it's okay.
How are you doing love, have you been to the toilet Christopher?
No.
No, it's a bit difficult for you that one.
But I expect we could try.
We could try to.
one day when you play with me and we'll play against Christopher.
Right this minute now cos it's quarter to nine already, we need to be getting going to school considering we were n't going five minutes ago and now we are!
Do you feel alright still?
Does it?
Do you think it might be best if we stayed at home.
today?
What.
what do you think Christopher?
I know you do!
You're fine are n't you?
Ooh we have n't got you any socks!
Ah!
Nip upstairs and get you some socks.
If you're feeling okay look, you have a, get started on those and I'll help you get a quick quick change.
Pardon?
Your tummy hurts.

Pardon?
Not you, what?
Have a day off?
I know, cos you're alright are n't you?
Yeah is that okay?
And we'll.

That's true do n't want to on his birthday.
So did I.
Mm, right come on then.
Oh right.
Do n't tell me any secrets will you?
Alright well do n't tell me.
He I do, and, ah he's talking about bags in drawers so far, so that's alright.
You've been very good.
You're still hurting, oh dear!
I think we'll have a quiet day today between us.
What about this library story time?
Are you capable of getting to the library Christopher?
So we take Chri, Timothy to the story time and then you stay with me and we'll potter around the shops and the little library.
Actually that'll be quite good cos that'd be nice to see whether you can get out and about without keeling over!
And then you can come home and have a rest when you've been.
Yeah.
To school you mean?
I thought we might just keep an eye open for Margaret and Beth.
walking up the road, we can tell them.
If we see her walking up the road we can tell her, and if we do n't, we'll give them a ring later on.
There you go, arm in.
Is it? if it was James to give them a message at school.
Certainly somebody singing and dancing.
Mhm.

Did you, where?
Oh where is it then?
Be on the floor somewhere, it usually is!
Come on pop an arm in here.
I do n't think we'd lost it had we?
Cor!
Mm.
Well we took erm mums and toddler erm what's it's?
Tea towels innit, on Thursday.
Yes you did, that was yesterday when we went to church and scramblers, but Christopher did n't go to cos he was n't very well was he?
Yeah, we did n't want you being sick in.
You did did n't you?
Good and then you went fe, worse again in the afternoon did n't you?
I think we'll just have a nice quiet day today erm there's a little bit of a snag because I do n't quite know what we're going to do about all these children that like to go to the library.
We usually have them all in the car.
I do n't know where your plectrum is, I expect it's on the floor somewhere waiting for my hoover to get it!
Well it's alright I'll keep my eyes open and if I see it I'll pick it up.
Right, have you done your teeth this morning sunshine?
You have n't, right well go and do yours then, then we'll know it's done.
Yes he has, he's just been up there to do them cos he thought he might be going to school now he's decided he's not so we'll put the school clothes away again.
It's all very tricky to know is n't it?
Whether to go or not.
It's and it's a bit of a an exhausting day if you do n't feel too well.
I did n't.
these are yesterday's.
Yesterdays from erm, when you laid down on.
Have we seen Margaret coming along yet?
No, I have n't either.
You keep your eyes open, see if you can see her.
Will you see her from down there?
Tim would you like to come and do your teeth?
Please.
Well that's her name, ha!
I expect her mum called it her, when she was a little baby.
Right Tim, watch my lips please could you go upstairs and clean your teeth?
Come on love.
What do you mean no?
Well do you need me upstairs, or can you manage?
Cos I've got the brush down for you.
No!
Down off the holder it's on the sink ready with the the toothpaste on it.
Can you manage?
You need me do you?
Up we go then.
Lift you?
That's pathetic!
I'll hold your hand.
There you go.
Wrong way!
Yes.
I know, you're as scatty as mummy you are!
You need to go to the toilet?
Well then let's go there.
Okay, do a wee.
What a nuisance!
That's it do it up again.
You did yes.
Good!
Right can we get your teeth done now do you think?
What's that then?
Everything hurts in our family at the moment does n't it?
It's just the pocket really let's turn you round a bit see if it hurts it's just the way it is I'm afraid see if we can open it up and spread it out a bit.
How's that?
See if there's any rubbish in the bins shall we?
Oh must of emptied these fairly recently, it's not too bad is there lots in that one?
Tip that one into there.
There we are.
Hello.
And what's fallen off?
Well not all trees lose their leaves.
Well they just sort of drop off when they die and then grow some new ones but they do n't drop them all off like all some of the other trees do in the Autumn.
They do n't, sort of, do it all together.
I know.
Yeah.
That's true and it looks very fresh in the spring.
Hello.
You ca n't walk?
You hold my hand, it'll help.
You do n't want to hold my hand?
Oh!
I like your teddy see if he can walk.
Is he asleep?
Oh yeah.
You'll have to have a look on the way down and then pass the buds they should be coming now cos it's nearly spring well it is spring really.
Well it's supposed to be officially winter until the twenty first which is soon.
Fifteenth at the moment six days but spring is really just when new things begin to grow and they're definitely beginning to grow now.
Mm.
I like it when it's people's birthday too.
Does n't matter when it's yours or somebody elses, it's just fun is n't it?
Right.
I quite like it when it's somebody elses, I must say.
Mind you, I shall enjoy mine tomorrow.
Yes.
Go on then.
That's it.
I'm sure you'll get a bag at my party tomorrow.
Well they're for the dustbin men.
Is teddy sad?
Oh dear!
Oh he does look sad does n't he?
Have to cheer him up a bit!
It is a dustbin man but he's not come to our road yet.
Oh a ladybird Chri, Tim!
Christopher's found a ladybird look walking along the fence.
Sweet is n't she?
How.
many legs?
There's supposed to be six I think three at each side and then there's some feelers and things knocking about a bit there.
How many spots then?
Seven spots?
Do n't know.
She'll walk up your nose if you get that close!
It's a lady.
Morning!
Ladybird.
is what the excitement's about!
The ladybird is what the excitement's about.
Come on!
It's quite warm out is n't it?
Oh dear!
Yeah.
No, not everyone only the people who are foolish enough to save up.
Yes.
Oh look, somebody's chopped a daffodil head off!
Here look.
Is n't that sad!
Can you see it in the grass.
Oh, I think somebody's picked it and thrown it down.
Mhm.
Yep.
Why is water there and not here?
Well probably it's not dried up over there.
but it has here.
Well lots of things dry up water do n't they?
The sunshine dries it up and sometimes it depends on what it's use how deep it is as to whether it dries up.
Oh ha!
Boo!
Oh here's the dustbin men doing their bit.
Here.
He's collecting all the rubbish bags into a big pile.
No love, it's not lunch time.
Are you hungry?
I think you must be getting better, myself.
Well you did n't eat anything yesterday did you, except half a hot cross bun which is a funny thing to eat, but never mind!
You fell asleep!

You did, you went were fast asleep!
You ate your hot cross bun and then you fell fast asleep on the settee.
Your head hurts?
Oh dear!
I thought that might happen.
as we got a bit nearer to the library.
Well not to worry cos we're nearly there so we can have a sit down.
You sit down and have a rest, and we'll pop in the chemist and get some Calpol, cos we're running out.
And a dose of Calpol will sort you out and a nice rest when we get home.
Good job.
we did n't go to school after all, is n't it?
Good job we did n't go to school after all, cos you'd of run round in the playground, you'd of been shattered! oops, too late!
I do n't know it's a bin!
I do n't know, it looks as if it's got some grit in it for when it gets icy I suppose you have to put he grit down there.
Mm.
Teddy's still sad?
I do n't know what you're gon na do to cheer him up.
You'll have to give him lots of love.
Mhm.
Did you?
Another dream?
What was that?
A funny one this time, or a scary one?
Mrs!
Well what did Mrs say?
Oh I see!
And what did she do?
Was it a nice day?
Everything go funny?
Sometimes in dreams everything goes most peculiar does n't it?
No, it was a pleasant dream.
Sometimes dreams are quite pleasant, you think, ooh I like that dream, I'd like that one again.
It never quite works out like that.
Oh yeah.
that's right.
Yeah!
Mm mm.
Well I do n't think they come true really it just sort of feels real.
Sometimes you can wake up and you think, ooh that was very real and then when you think about it.
you think, ooh that was most.
odd!
Could n't possibly of been real!
I think the night was full of dreams for all sorts of people.
But really you were in bed.
Mm mm.
But sometimes when you're not very well and you get very very hot you get funny dreams, I think you had a very funny dream in the middle of last night did n't you?
Do you remember?
You were very frightened, we had to get you up read you a story have a cuddle put the light on.
It was something like half past two in the morning!
Anyway it did n't matter cos you were very good, and you went back to sleep again in the end then you did n't wake up till after daddy had gone to work this morning!
Oh right.
Aha.
Did n't matter, we were glad you had a good long sleep, cos it makes you.
feel better when you sleep.
Now what is Timothy doing.
may we ask?
Oh dear!
Come on or else you'll miss the story, it's nearly time.
Only two minutes to go!
Right, come on.
then.
What you doing?
Well walk round!
Well you did it the other day but then you did n't have a teddy in your hand did you?
I'll hold the teddy.
And down we go.
Alright there?
There you go.
I know, I do n't know what they're doing there, do you?
Well they're digging everywhere round here at the moment.
They're supposed to be giving us a face lift of..
Do n't know.
We'll just give our library books in.
Oh dear, I think he's got a bit sad!
There does n't seem to be anybody here now.
Alright, shall I hold this?
You want me to hold the teddy?
Gon na take your coat off?
Mhm.
I do n't know where they all are must of all disappeared!
Why does it say what?
I do n't know.
Oh right then.
Here you go look, with Rosie she's ready look.
We'll worry about our books in a minute.
You take the teddy.
You can cheer him up, there you are, have a finger.
Oh, there's the other lady look!
Have a nice time.
Do n't forget to cheer that teddy up, it's all sad.
Morning!
I've got a big poorly boy.
Well he was poorly yesterday, he was a little sick and we do n't know whether he was going.
to make it or not today but he's half with us today!
I thought we'd come for a little walk and.
down the road.
Says he's got a headache so we'll have go and to stock up.
on the Calpol and then we'll be, er.
Oh did you?
Oh Mark's oh yes.
Ian.
Was he, did he go hot and.
Oh well it was the same thing then.
Oh that's encouraging!
Oh course granddad knows all about these things does n't he?
Oh!
Yeah, Christopher said everything was hurting basically.
so we just dosed him up on Calpol.
and he slept most of yesterday afternoon.
Mm.
And in night we're all.
we're all with ridiculous dreams and goodness knows what!
Oh.
He was absolutely terrified at.
half past two in the morning, we had to have a story and.
relax!
!
No, we have that, and from Tim, we have.
something about blue machines with Tim.
Most odd!
Yeah.
But.
he has n't been sick.
so.
And it costs a bomb to have your.
duvet dry cleaned so Oh thank you very much!
Sorry, we're just standing here talking!
Now, do you think we can make it to the post box let's go and have a try shall we?
I thought we'd do it in the fresh air rather than in the car, cos it just means.
Oh yes, attached to it, and you've just had yourself taped by the way.
A little man turned up Friday afternoon, after they got home you know how we're very susceptible to these market research types?
And erm it's all to do with language in the nineteen nineties to go to be transcribed for posterity and used to see the change and development of languages.
and the dictionary people so I have to tape myself conversing with people.
for a week.
Which is all very entertaining!
And sometimes I, sort of.
things like that, but I'm sure they'll sort it out.
I presume that's why it's for a week, you know?
Out of twenty tapes surely they'll be one that.
would n't will!
Oh dear!
We'll make our way down to the post box first, and then we'll come back and get bits and pieces on the way Christopher.
Goes through phases of being quite quite boisterous.
and then other times of being.
pathetic!
But that's probably due to.
yesterday.
Yeah.
Tim's only been you know, it sounds like it's it's mi, erm Ian's had.
the full works, and we've had.
semi-works, followed.
by just a pathetic little effort.
really, for me, I suppose.
But Martin's been alright has he then?
Yeah.
I wonder what it was?
Did granddad have.
any er.
on the matter?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
We just sort of stuck cold flannels all over them.
and cooled them down.
Seemed to be the only thing to do to them.
Yep.
Bye!
Erm usually they leave the dog tied up somewhere.
Right, in we go, Rice Krispies we need.
I'm not sure what else, I'll have a look on the list.
Yep.
There's lots of spare batteries at home.
Which ones are you thinking of?
Where?
Yeah, well there's gon na be lots of batteries in the little bedroom because this this machine needs lots of batteries.
Ooh, we in a traffic jam!
People jam!
We need some Ribena thank you.
Can you manage that?
We have have n't we?
Yep.
Erm have we got the Rice Krispies, I ca n't remember?
Used to be here.

Ooh it's huge that one!
It's got a with it?
Oh!
What we could really do with is an Easter egg with an egg cup with it.
Cos we've broken our egg cups the other day, do you remember?
We're a bit short on egg cups at home.
Can you guess what mummy's done?
Who's forgotten the list then?
Me!
Just check my pockets.
Oh, here we are all is not lost!
Oh we only need Rice Krispies in here then, then the rest of the things in the green grocers.
Mm.
Do you know where they keep the Ri, oh it's down here look, there.
Should n't keep changing everything round.
Forgotten now.
Well it looks like there's one box of Rice Krispies here.
I think the Rice Krispies are up there are n't they, in that, box there?
Have a look in here.
Ca n't reach that lot.
so we'll have to find somebody to help us.
And what's.
Dunno, but it says, it said about at the Rice Krispies.
Mm, that was useful hang onto that.
Right, we need a Rice Krispie box.
Yeah but he was a shopper so person in charge let's go and see if we can find someone.
A shopper a person like us shopping.

I ca n't see a soul today!
Somebody's apart from the till people.
Pardon?
Yep, they're down.

We can see them up the top but.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's me that's the problem I, ha ha.
Grey doors?
I do n't there's anybody in here either.
I know.
Oh, service with a smile, he's probably gone out for a coffee!
Let's g let's go back to the cashier and see what we can do.
Otherwise I think we'll do without our Rice Krispies!
I think we'll do without our Rice Krispies, if we ca n't manage to get some.
I said, we'll have to do without our Rice Krispies, if we ca n't manage to get any.
No joy!
Thank you.
No.
They've all skived off!
Come over here love, cos we're not in the queue.

And we decided to get lots of copies for all our friends that we have n't seen for a long long time so I asked if they could do them for me but I thought they would be back by now, well they should of been back ages ago actually!
But they're not yet!
Go and see if we can get some tomatoes from here.
Kiwi fruits do n't you like kiwi fruits.
No?
Well you always say you do n't but I do n't know whether you've ever tried it properly, really I think it's just the thought of it that you do n't like.
Oh right.
Pineapple it was, that you had as a drink, that you did n't like.
Some cucumber.
Yes, we do need some tomatoes.
Would you like to.
get me some?
Pop them in there.
You're looking for nice well I do n't need bananas in one.
Tomatoes need to go in a bag or else they'll roll about all the over the place see if you can spot, the small-ish ones, but not like that, see cos that's got a mark on it, we do n't want that one.
Er no, cos of that there look, see look for the nice healthy ones very small.

Amusing little incident in Quick Saver!
We wanted our Rice Krispies, and.
there was only one on a sort of opened pack and we could.

Eventually this dear girl gets herself off the cash desk right and where does she find them?
Another box were on the floor, I could of helped myself!

Just fun really.

Oh what a pity, I've read all those ones.
Is it important?
Not really, just sort of helps you know what you what you're picking up off the shelf.
What does what say?
Wainwright.
Probably because he's an author or she's an author.
He, it says John Wainwright, there we are if you want to pick them up by John Wainwright, that's where they are.
Mm different signs on different shelves.
Oh that's probably because they want you to look for yourself.
Ca n't remember if I've read this one or not.
These go there.
Oh dear!
Sounds like Martin.
Actually you're right, it does sound like Ian!
Do you want to choose a book today?

Seems to be wandering about all over the place!
Yeah!
Sometimes you long for half an hours.
run do n't you?
But I mean, you know, sort of walk.
Have you seen anything of Sarah this weekend, is she alright?
Oh well done! if that was on Friday afternoon.
when I s, when I saw you?
I thought we'd better get out the way there!

a choc ice and pear, going down when I had her.
Dear!
Wednesday night.
And that's all she's had all week!
Oh dear!
Well it is.
silly is n't it?
And she must know that it's silly.
So did you tell her?
Did you lay into her?
No!
It did n't.
No.
No.
Well I think we ought to say.
What did she say to that?
Did n't care!
I think we should of done really.
because otherwise.
it's just gon na go from bad to worse is n't.
it?
Well at least he'll have been here this weekend to find.
out, wo n't he?
But the trouble is he's gon na be so bogged down with his job problems.
He'll think her, eats yeah.
No that's what I gathered.
Yeah.
The thing with doing this recording I've noticed that the.
the time we really sit we down and talk is at.
meal times.
Particularly as a family here with the children.
what we've done and.
Oh!
I know.
Yeah.
On Saturday, well I produced this.
cottage pie, expecting her to join in, unless.
she was going out you know.
which is fair enough.
and she obviously was, sort of, most surprised that we were all gon na sit round the table and eat it!
Oh!
We're looking!
Mark can do, Mark's bigger.
Older anyway.
You what?
Yeah.
James's mum said to me, and she does n't know her from Adam, she said.
that lady is on, been on the corner, standing there talking for the last twenty minutes which must mean that Mark was late to school this morning so then.
she must be going to High Down Hill.
Or is he not going to school this morning?
Ah right.
They said they were setting off at nine o'clock as if to go.
to school.
I mean, you know, it was ten to nine or whatever.
Saw them at ten to nine, and then she passed them again at ten past nine.
Well I dunno.
I mean this was just, James's.
mum had said.
But she did n't know her, you know.
And I thought, oh no Sarah do n't do it!
Because just everything seems to be going to pot!
That sounds like the best idea!
What's the problem dear?
Why are we all worrying?
Oh go on with you!
We've got Cider with us again.
No problem.
Oh is it today?
You feel you want to do something, but I just do n't what you can do.
really, beyond, like you say, telling Simon and seeing what he can do but.
cos we ca n't just stand by and watch her fade away can we?
Rather it stop now than.
another two months and then the woman's in hospital and goodness knows what and.
No ouch tha!
Yeah.
And me and I go all wobbly and.
When I was pregnant I was really.
Used to have to eat all sorts of things at different times I used to try and eat apples as opposed to, you know, sort of, something fairly healthy but.
I would go qui, quite wobbly and sometimes have to.
lie down for a bit!
That sounded like.
That's a good one!

I expect they're going home.
Perhaps they've been for their walk, this one looks as if he's so old he can hardly!
No, he's going.
home!
Mm.
Oh did he?
Cos he did n't know her!
Well I mean, he does know her but I mean he, perhaps.
he did n't, does n't realise the.
state of the girl!
Oh dear!
You'd think they'd notice at work would n't you?
Perhaps well I do n't suppose they would.
Yeah.
She must be eating something, to keep going surely?
No, not quite!
Hope thi.
Good.
We'll do another one, or do you want to do something different?
Right.
It's back on the shelf there I think.
Mm.
On my bookshelf, just there.
Shall I get it for you?
While mast.
while mastermind is doing his maths.
Over here.
Where are we?
Number one.
Here.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
How are we doing?
You just dropped a pencil.
Have you just dropped your pencil?
I should n't just leave it on the floor look cos we sha n't find it again and then when the hoover tries to pick it up it will have a fit.
hoover up a pencil do we?
No we do n't.
Do n't know where the is yet do we?
Mm.
Could be.
True.
I bet there's a lot of things behind there.
Such as.
We had to get most of them out.
I tried to get most of them out.
Good.
There's not supposed to be.
I do try and get most of the things out from behind there it's this this bookcase I have terrible trouble with.
Come on.
Let's be getting going.
Are we having this story?
Are you ready?
Timmy the catcher mouse was a little black cat.
Timmy the catcher mouse was a very long name for a very little cat so everyone called him Tim.
Tim lived in a hole under the steps of a very old house.
He lived there with his mother and his sister Tessa.
That does n't say Tessa.
That one says.
Tim.
That's right.
His mother's name was Peggity but everyone called her Pegs.
And what does this bit say?
That's right.
One day Pegs was going out.
You can play in the garden while I'm away she said.
But remember this.
A magician lives in the house everyone says that he's very grumpy so if you meet the magician you must be very polite.
I'll remember said Tim.
Tim and.
That's right.
Pegs went out.
She ran across the garden to the old iron gate.
She crept under the gate and out into the lane.
No, it says Pegs went out.
That's right.
Again.
That's right.
There's the word went look, and there's the word out.
Pegs went out.
That's right.
Well you can see it there.
There's Pegs.
There's went.
And that's out.
It is, yes.
Mhm.
You do, you're right.
Tim looked at his sister.
She was fast asleep.
Tim jumped on her to wake her up but she only said go away, and went back to sleep again.
What does this bit say?
Do you remember?
Jumped.
That one bit says Tim and that bit there says jumped.
Tim jumped.
Yes.
Whoops, we've missed, I lost our page there.
Tim got out of the hole.
The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
Tim went out into the garden.
Hold on.
You've got to say this bit first.
Very good.
That was a bit clever.
Tim saw a tree well er they look all done to me.
That's right.
The tree was growing near the house.
Do you want to try that one?
It's a bit like what we've been doing before where you've got to look at the money.
It said how much for both?
Tick the money you will need.
You have to tick off.
It's going to be nine p and one p.
That makes ten p altogether and you have to tick off the ten pence by doing a five and a five.
So you have to add this bit up first.
Three p and five p and write down what it comes to.
What will that be?
Wait a minute.
Well find that first of all.
Three p and five p makes?
Jus can I just show Christopher what to do with this page?
Cos once he's got going he can get on with it himself then.
That's right.
So put your eight p down there.
And then you have to work out the coins that you'll need for eight p.
or three p and five p.
So which ones will you need?
Just tick them off, the bits that you'll need.
Nearly.
Tim ran to the tree.
Will you need what love?
Two two and one.
That would make five.
And then you need another three.
Why do n't you have the fi look for the three p first and tick that off and then look for the five p next and tick that off.
Mm.
Cos you know that five p and three p are gon na make eight p do n't you?
Just hold on Tim while I just sort him out.
Cos if.
That's right.
That's five p and now you need.
No you ca n't really.
That's better.
Well make a big tick sticking out like there's does.
That's it, now That's it there, now what else makes eight p?
Tim climbed to the very top of the tree.
He looked down and saw the house.
The roof of the house was very close to the top of the tree.
Looked.
Down.
That's it.
Tim looked down.
You've got four p there.
Do you know what you're doing on that that that's for that one.
You're up here.
Mm.
You've ticked the wrong things but it does n't matter cos we can probably use those anyway.
It's a good try.
It actually says Tim saw the window.
Tim jumped on to the roof of the house.
There was a window in the roof.
Tim saw the window.
The window was open.
Saw.
the.
window.
That's it.
That's it.
Well done.
Now you have to do this one.
Tricky are n't they, these?
Tim ran up the roof to the window.
He looked down into the room below.
He saw an old man sitting in a chair.
The old man had long white hair and a white beard.
He must be a magician.
Tim said to himself.
That's it.
The magician.
Well done.
Mhm.
The magician was fast asleep.
Tim leaned over to have a good look at him, but his foot slipped and he fell in.
He landed right on the magician's knee.
Tim dug in his claws and held on.
Well done.
The magician woke up with a yell of pain.
He saw Tim standing on his knee.
Where on earth did you come from?
He asked.
I fell in said Tim.
Then you'd better fall out again said the magician.
Take your claws out of my knee and go away.
The.
woke.
That's it.
Tim pulled out his claws.
He looked up at the.
window.
I ca n't get up there by myself he said.
Looked.
up.
It is it.
You're right.
We'll soon see about that said the magician.
One two three and you're back.
in the tree.
And he snapped his fingers.
This one says one two three.
That's it.
That's it.
Very good.
Tim felt himself flying up in the air.
A moment later he found himself back in the top of the tree.
And.
Yeah.
And.
was in the.
Very good.
You're good at this book are n't you Tim?
Tim climbed down the tree just as Pegs came back into the garden.
Tim ran to ni to meet her.
Tim cried Pegs.
Where have you been?
Ran.
Well it should say Tim ran home.
It does n't, it just says Tim ran.
It would make more sense if it said Tim ran home.
He has.
I've been to see the magician said Tim.
It was very exciting.
I expect it was said Pegs but you better be careful Tim.
Magicians can work magic.
I know they can said Tim.
The magician did work magic.
I flew up into the tree.
It was very exciting but I shall be very careful next time.
That's it.
Tim and Pegs.
It's cos they're both on the picture.
And that's the end of the book.
You were very good at that were n't you?
Oh good gracious.
Two nines.
Oh that's.
easy then.
You'll be able to use the same coins.
That's only seven.
Two and five is only seven.
You need another two.
That's it.
Mm.
You do n't have to.
If you want to you can give up now and we'll do some reading next.
Do you want to have a go at My Mum's a Window Cleaner?
And then after that we'll go in the garden.
I said after that we'll go in the garden before it rains.
We'll also have to ring grandma and tell her that we wo n't be coming to her house today cos we wo n't be going swimming.
Cos although you're much better now.
I do n't think you should be going to erm I do n't think we'll read another one just right this minute lovey.
Cos I'm going to read with Christopher.
now.
It's Christopher's turn to read.
You feel really better?
Well that's nice?
He's not going swimming, no.
Would you like to go and get a card out of there look, and do some drawing?
Yeah.
We're playing schools now.
My mum's a window cleaner.
After this we're gon na play gardens.
You have to dig up all the weeds that are poking through.
Tidy it up a bit and if we get time.
We have n't got felt tips love.
Just use these ones.
The felt tips are too far away.
My mum's a window cleaner.
Drive.
They are actually.
There are one or two women that drive buses but not that many.
But my mum's a.
Ladder.
Cos if you walk under her ladder she might drop the water all over your head.
Some people say it's unlucky to walk under ladders.
I think it's a lot of rubbish.
Mm.
Well there you are.
That's why it would be unlucky, cos she'll drop water all over you.
No I do n't.
I think it's silly to say that.
It's just a bit of a joke really.
But some people think it's serious.
You have to be careful when you walk under a ladder or.
Sh.
That's it.
Now then.
Do the sounds for that one cos you'll get there in the end.
swings.
That's it.
You duck.
When she swings her ladder round you duck.
Do you know what it means to duck?
You go like this bob your head down quick.
Otherwise she might clout you round the earhole with her ladder.
Yeah.
Look at all those birds floating about in our erm all these pigeons in our garden.
There's four.
What do you think they're eating?
Worms.
Mm.
Mm that one's just got a bright juicy one.
I just watched it go down its mouth.
Look they must be having their lunch.
Right where were we?
Sometimes.
Cleans.
Yeah.
It's all about my mum being a window cleaner, this book.
Scared.
Well read it and you'll find out.
With.
That's it.
A.
Mhm.
Having.
No.
Having a?
Bath.
Even.
They must have all been in the house in the fire.
She got them all out.
Everybody.
Cheered.
Arrived.
Gave.
Helmet.
Bigger.
Does n't.

That was a good story was n't it?
I enjoyed that one.
We picked a good one from the library there.
Did you enjoy that one Tim?
Did you think that was good?
No we thought it was a window cleaning book.
It's really a fire engine book.
That was more of a fire engine book than it is a window cleaning book is n't it?
That's a very nice picture now.
Oh we could read it or we could go in the garden.
What do you think?
We've had a story each now.
Oh!
We've got to ring grandma.
Would you like to help talk to grandma on the phone?
Go on then.
Right but.
One of you hold the receiver and the other one do the numbers.
Do you know what to do for the numbers?
Well hold on cos it's no good until you Pardon?
Yes she should be back at her house.
Just wait Tim cos you've got to wait till you've got the receiver picked up before you start dialling anything.
And then you've got to dial the right numbers or else you wo n't get grandma, you'll get somebody else.
Are you gon na talk Christopher?
Right there you go.
You pick the receiver up.
Okay Tim, number six.
You say hello for starters.
Go on, right round Tim.
That's it.
I'll tell you in a minute.
That one there.
nine.
Say we're not going to come swimming today.
Seven whoops two.
and this one.
Right round.
Whoops.
That should be it.
Is it ringing?
Tell her it's Christopher to start with.
She might not know who you are.
Oh we're all well.
Yes they're definitely erm alright now.
Sunshine over there'll be going to school tomorrow, no problem.
Well it does at the moment but.
he's not been quiet all day.
He's probably tired by now I should think.
He read that to me daddy.
He was very good.
He'll have to read it to you next.
Thought we'd have a reading session so we had a reading book and we had some maths.
Yes the tea is ready.
You need to wee so perhaps when daddy goes up to.
get changed.
Yeah.
You go with daddy cos he's going up there anyway.
Shall I start dishing it out?
I mean it's that that.
near to being ready.
Two minutes.
Hello.
No.
I'm just giving dishing out the, the dinner love.
It's the beef left over from yesterday and broccoli and carrots and sprouts.
I've only given you one sprout so you're alright.
Yeah.
Mummy and daddy like sprouts so we've got lots.
You've just got one sprout Christopher.
I'm not giving you much at all.
Just a little bit of everything.
To see how you go.
No, it's not er filled up yet.
I've not put any what's.
Mm.
I'm going to make some gravy for you.
Cos mummy and daddy have got mushrooms and tomatoes cos we like those.
frowning at me for?
Are you not feeling too hungry now?
Well it's alright.
Do n't worry, I'm not expecting you to eat much, just a little bit.
Cos if you eat biscuits and stuff all day long, I do n't expect you to eat meals as well.
Yeah that's you.
I do n't think it'll kill you do you, to eat that?
Okay?
Is that alright for you?
Here love, that's yours.
Okay chatterboxes, let's have it.
How was your day then love?
Oh.
impressive.
That's you Tim.
And we'll chop your meat up before we go much further.
There's you.
And what else have do you notice dear?
Well half a clean tidy garden.
We have.
And we've put a bit of seed on that bit so it's.
Seems like an appropriate thing to do when one's stuck at home.
Tim sit.
Properly please.
four huge pigeons sitting in the on the grass earlier on.
There used to be two but there's four now.
Do you think they've.
You did bang the drum.
Anybody want any of this?
No Tim.
Well if you stop crying and ask for it properly and you do n't mind if mummy or daddy do it for you that's fine.
No.
Do you want me to do it or not?
Right.
You just want to pick it out?
You're not going to shake it over your dinner?
Thank you.
Right, here you are.
That's that one done.
Thank you.
Right.
Good gracious me.
What a carry on.
Welcome home dear.
It's been comparatively peaceful today.
They all sort of surfaced.
I think I'd had I finished my breakfast when, no I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal.
It was about quarter to eight before everybody, well after that.
What time did you get up?
What time did you go?
Mm.
It was about ten to eight when Christopher got up.
But Tim was still asleep till about quarter past eight.
Which is unheard of.
Yes you did shout for daddy.
There was no daddy.
He'd gone to work already.
So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school.
And I decided he was, should stay at home.
Mm.
He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day but he's been.
fine since.
Nursery.

We did go down to the library.
Cos I thought it would, it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk see if he was alright.
Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops.
But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit.
Mhm.
Yeah I rang up and said I was n't gon na go the children.
Anyway it turned out we met Ann and erm both Martin and Ian are been having a similar trauma.
Mm.
Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and.
delirious and hot hot.
fever.
So.
Mm.
Must be.
And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic.
A bit like these two really.
But Ian had been sick as well.
I should think so.
Although Christopher did n't really see much of them did he?
Oh he did on Thursday did n't he?
I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from contact erm wise.
These things do n't work like that do they?
Mm.
Yeah.
Well it certainly did in both these cases.
Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos not the way back from school, way back from the library.
And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling under the weather.
So I do n't know what that's in aid of.
Was she?
Oh dear.
What's the matter with her?
What's the matter with her?
You do n't want the meat?
You usually like meat.
Mm.
Let's chop it for you.
Tim listen.
I'm going to chop you.
I'm going to chop you one piece of meat okay?
We'll take away the other piece.
Yeah.
There you go.
It'll be nice now.
Nice and tasty.
Well done Christopher.
You alright?
Well it has really.
It's been a bit sort of muggy this afternoon but we went out in the garden and we sort of just pottled around you know?
Yeah.
Mm.
It's certainly very wet out there.
Apart from her sore throat was Julie okay?
Mm?
Oh.
Where are they all?
Mm.
Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove yeah.
Mm.
What do they do?
Mm.
I did not.
I certainly did n't give you lots of meat.
Oh that's alright.
You do n't need to have anything else.
Oh no.
If you're full you wo n't need pudding.
Well that's okay.
You can leave it but you just do n't get pudding as well.
Getting potatoes in your eyes.
That's a funny place to put potato.
Mm broccoli does n't want to come on the fork.
Come here broccoli.
We rang grandma of course to say we would n't be swimming.
There's a lot of things we're not doing is n't there at the moment?
Yes.
She's fine.

Oh that's it really.
And zom zombieness in between.
No.
It all passed along did n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
We did n't watch much video this morning at all really.
until lunchtime.
He tells me.
Oh, right.
I think that was a different boat to the one that they showed you on the telly.
Mm.
He showed me what it was.
But I could n't tell that it was the Queen Mary at the time because he'd already cut it out.
Mm.
That's the same is n't it?
Well done Tim.
What was Walt Disney doing with it may we ask?
Was it a restaurant or something?
Why?
Oh.
Yes we know that Tim but you're just going to have to wait until we've all finished.
Ooh daddy!
Right.
You'll have to put the exercise video on dear and.
Mm.
A new Rosie and Jim.
They go to a shire horse centre near Stratford on Avon.
Do you know where that is?
I did n't know there was one.
Yes.
Let's just cut the pa.
Thank you.
Okay.
I'll just go round the other side and get the ice-cream.
Are you?
You did finish all your dinner in the end did n't you after moaning on.
Yes, did n't you notice?
He finished the lot.
Typical.
Right.
That's that's daddy's.
Do you want to take that to daddy?
That's Christopher's.
And that's that's you.

Cos I just fancy them at the moment.
I sort of.
Do you?
Oh have some too if you want.
It's certainly much improved on yesterday I tell you.
A very jolly day really.
It was a bit of a trial weekend.
In many respects.
I had actually porridge on Saturday.
Mm.
Why ca n't I have it on Saturday?
I did.
Neither did you.
Oh did n't I?
Beg pardon.
I'd forgotten that one.
Oh that was what I was remembering.
And the Saturday before that none of us had it cos you were gallivanting up and down the country with the.
the railways.
No we just rang her up.
Very briefly.
We've never had the car out all day.
What?
I thought it was more sensible to walk to the library rather than go in the car cos.
I thought it was good for us.
Mm.
So do I.
I think it says somewhere in the in the writing you've got to have done at least two days.
Who gave me what?
What?
A man.
It's only it's only on loan.
Oh that will make a nice birthday present.
A little Walkman.

Friday.
Why?
Because it's his anyway.
He's only just lent it to me to to use during this week.
Oh I do n't suppose it's his but.
Just this week.
Well Friday to Friday.
One week.
Mm it's been very thrilling so far has n't it?
Everybody being sick.
In the.
A jolly little incident in Kwiksave that you would have been amused at dear.
We wanted to get some Rice Crispies okay?
And we thought a good place to get Rice Crispies at Kwiksave.
cos they're cheaper than Tesco's.
They were we found the Rice Crispies.
place did n't we?
And there was just one sort of half opened, half scattered packet sitting there.
So we looked around and there was erm a box full of them right up high, yeah?
So we thought oh well, go and get an assistant.
So it caused chaos.
you know trying to find an assistant cos there was n't one walking about cos there was some at the tills but there were n't any walking around and it was very busy, there were lots of people going through the tills.
So anyway this girl eventually she said she was, it was her coffee break but she would come er in passing and sort us out.
So she came down, it was so embarrassing.
I explained about the Rice Crispies she said ah.
I think there must be some in here.
There was another great big box but instead of being up high it was down below and I could easily.
have helped myself to it.
Well they must have been just well they must have I did n't see them.
They must have been unpacking Rice Crispies.
They were a bit away from the Rice Crispie hole type of thing but if I'd have used my eyes I would have noticed where they were.
Yes Timothy.
You do n't know what to say now you've you've shouted at me.
Come on.
Let's hear it.
Or something about going to the library?
Who do you take to the library with you?
No.
Well he did but we did n't sort of take Christopher.
He just came.
Who did you take to the library with you?
In your hand, who did you have?
You took teddy did n't you?
We had n't actually heard anything about this library experience but when I asked him he would n't say anything.
We do n't quite know what happened.
What did you do with them when you got in there?
You had a biscuit?
Mm.
We saw the biscuit.
a picnic!
You had a picnic?
Well well.
A pretend picnic?
Mm.
He came out with a a a biscuit covered in desiccated coconut.
Which he did n't like to eat so Cider ate it in the end.
Cider the dog.

However we still do n't know what happened.
Did you have some stories with this teddy?
Mm.
Stories about teddies?
A teddy went in the dump?
Oh dear.
Did they get him out again?
Mm.
Oh.
No.
He went in a van?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm could have been that one.
Did you have any more stories about teddies?
Mm.
What else did you have?

Teddy what?
A teddy with an owl?
And what happened with a teddy and an owl?
He fell?
The teddy fell down?
Did the owl catch him?
Oh.
And the boy came back.
What was the boy called?
It was n't Christopher Robin was it?
No.
Trying my best.
Wrong again.
Thursday.
Only we ca n't take him on Thursday cos we're busy on Thursday.
So we shall have to miss a week, and go the week after.
Mm.
I presume so.
Well they did n't tell us why.
Just said it was n't.
I think they're just a bit shortstaffed because the girl that's usually in there has n't been in there for weeks, Josie.
They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday during the week.
Perhaps she's ill.
I said there's normally a different lady in the in the library.
On a Monday.
The lady that was in there today not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there well, when she's there.
The other lady, Josie, she's normally in there.
But she has n't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill.
Or on holiday or something.
No she ca n't be on holiday all that length of time.
No she was n't today.
There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday.
Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well.
They probably had to rake her in to hold the fort.
I do n't know.
I do n't know whether she did or not.
Mm.
Oh.
think about.
You'll enjoy that, it's all about eggs.
Should you ever want to watch it all.
It's all very gripping.
Well there wo n't be any time tomorrow to watch anything.
I've arranged with my.
I've arranged with my mother to er take her home after tea.
So all is well for Inspector Morse.
She was quite happy to.
She said she wanted to really.
And she said.
she'd got to do Wednesday night.
And I've just realized I'm supposed to do Wednesday night as well.
I'd forgotten.
So I'll have to prepare it tomorrow morning.
Or tonight, I could do.
It's not been Bump for a week or two.
Was it Poddington Peas?
Yeah.
Poddington Peas.
It had things like happy and dopey and grumpy.
Oh right.
Creepea.
Oh.
It sounds very gripping.
Oh dear.
Because we're not bothering watching any more now.
That's it.
I think so.
It'll be bed time.
It's quarter past six already.
True.
Yeah.
Unless you want to play tummyache?
Why why is he not eating it up?
He's always eaten it before.
Well we were, but only with daddy.
We can always do it another day.
Cos you know, as long as it's on there.
He does n't mind do you daddy?
Not seeing it right at the minute.
Well it wo n't be wiped off dear.
Never wipe Rosie and Jim off for a long time.
True.
Sorry about that.
A slip of the finger.
Sorry.
Yes he did.
watch the jelly one.
I have.
It was all about moulds.
And the mould for the windlass.
Well there you are then.
We have n't missed anything.
Oh.
Mm.
I do n't think you do re miss it really.
You see them in the end.
Do other people have so much trouble with their videos?
I wonder if other people have so much trouble videoing videos as we do?
Well it's not so much trouble but kind of you know.
excitement about it all.
Mm.
Do you think it'll wear off?
You know as the newness of the video wears off.
Mm I watched that, remember?
I sat down with my coffee.
As I, well I got given orders.
Come and watch this mummy.
So I thought I would.
What might be more interesting is if re Christopher reads you his reading book from the library cos it's really good fun.
You'll enjoy the story.
Cos it was a surprise to us was n't it?
Do n't tell him do n't tell him do n't tell him cos it's more exciting.
if he does n't know.
Go and get it now cos he'll enjoy it.
Cos it's, oh you can listen to this now, it's only about.
ten seconds.
And then we can play tummyache without any interruption.
I think that might have gone actually this morning.
Mm we've got eggs, eggs in yeah, eggs instead.
Not walk.
Some mums.

Well let's chop it up.
Then you'll feel it's better.
It's chocolate.
Or you might.
A.
Shh.
Shh.
the way you said it.
You are a tummyache.
You've always eaten that pie before Tim, what's the matter with it today?
Are you becoming a fusspot?
Yeah.
Well you can stop being a fusspot if you do n't mind.
We do n't like fusspots in this family.
Now listen.
Listen listen listen.
You'll probably need to go to the toilet soon.
See if you can be as clever as you were yesterday.
Mm.
Why are there cars in the wash basket?
Mhm.
It is horrible that.
I expect it's in this pile somewhere.
There it is.
Right.
Shuffle them up.

Are you gon na tender on that orange?
Nice orange drink instead of that horrible one.
No.
Right.
Let's throw out the horrible one and put the nice one on.
So you only need a.
nice bit of fish in the middle there I think.
Oh look at that.
Horrid.
I do n't want that.
Have you won?
Oh look at that.
He's got a jelly.
Well done.
Right it's just me and you now Tim.
Oh that's a nice pudding.
Did you?
Are you going to put the pudding down on there cos then I can pick it up.
There we are.
I've won too.
It's just you now Tim.
How far you have to go before you get a main course?
Oh an old boot.
You do n't want an old boot.
Are you swapping the boot for the fish?
He wants his boot.
Boots and beans and r erm jacket potato.
Delicious.
Chops.
That'll be just right.
Oh.
It's a nasty pudding.
That's okay he's got a nice.
You've got a nice pudding so you do n't need a nasty pudding.
No, you're just being silly.
Oh look at this.
What a mess.
I think so.
Shall we have another game?
Right.
Let's see if we can all do better.
We'll have to wrap th erm shuffle them up well cos otherwise all the nice things will be together and all.
Wait wait wait wait wait.
No you're not to throw them in the air.
That's a silly way of doing it.
Doch.
Right, what time is it?
Oh twenty five to seven.
Jolly good.
We'll have one more game of this and then you'll have to choose your stories, okay?
Oh lucky you chops.
Your turn.
No it's you cos.
Well you're meant to go the same way as the clock goes and that means it's you next.
Ooh!
Pie.
That's nice.
I bet I get something horrid if you've all had nice things.
Oh no nice.
Oh more nice things.
Nice fish fingers.
You're choosing fish fingers not pie.
Oh good, I'll have the pie then.
Pie and peas.
Well you've got two.
Oh I should keep the strawberries if I were you.
Strawberries are delicious.
Are you having that one Tim?
A nice baking apple.
Leave those on the floor.
No we're not waiting.
What are you doing?
You're having that instead are you?
Right, well I'll have the baking apple then.
Yeah, you do n't like the biscuits do you?
The wafers.
Oh we are doing well.
We have n't had anything horrid yet.
Ah, here we come.
Horrid little flowers to eat.
Ooh mashed potato.
Oh you just need a nice fork.
What's that one?
Mm good that'll.

I do n't think I'll have that.
Oh a nice pudding.
What shall I have?
Oh I think I'll have the jelly.
There you are.
Well it's quite nice that is there's sultanas in it.
Oh, what are you gon na do, jacket potato or chips?
Er dunno really, it varies.
You're gon na leave the chips are you?
Keep the jacket potato.
Right Tim, are you having those chips?
You need some chips.
Oh well, boiled potatoes, they'll do.
Right, let's have a nice drink please.
Oh dear.
Tadpoles in the drink.
Mhm.
You can have it look Tim and you've won.
Oh that was a silly thing to do.
No no that's silly.
That's not the rules of the game.
You ca n't do that.
You can only swap it for nice things.
No.
Sausages!
Ooh I'll have that instead of those.
Hold on Tim.
Right Tim.
Put that down.
That's yours.
You do n't want that cos you've already got a nice one have n't you?
Come on I want a nice drink please.
Oh beans.
Oh I'll have sausage and beans.
Makes a change.
There you go, do you want some peas.
Just right.
You've won.
Again.
Well you could have won but you were daft and did n't take the right card.
Oh you've won now.
You're second.
Let's see how long it takes for mummy.
Well you want that do n't you?
Mm.
Oop another horrid drink.
Come on, there must be a nice drink in there somewhere.
There it is.
A nice drink of water.
As ever.
Do n't you?
There are n't many other nice puddings.
You'll have to have that baking apple then with the sultana in it.
Oh I like tadpoles but not in my drink.
I did.
It was the first one I picked up.
If it's the first one you pick up you've got to have it.
Well I did in the end.
I put it back instead of a milky drink or something.
You have to keep the horrible thing if you have n't got anything else in the space.
That's the rule of the game.
Otherwise there's no game is there?
What's your favourite meal then?
What's your favourite meal?
What's your favourite Tim?
Not necessarily in the game, just anywhere.
What's your very favourite food?
Nothing, not listening to me.
Well I had sausages.

Oh if you're silly with that the pieces will be missing by the time we want to play it next time.
Go and fetch them back again.
Timothy tummyache.
Behind you.
Well.
why do you think it's called tummyache?
Mm.
You do sometimes.
You do sometimes.
When you were little and we first got the game you always used to want to get tummyaches and not the.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Except Tim's a bit older than you were at the time.
There we are.
Lid on.
Right, who's got a story?
Story anybody?
I'm looking.
Well I'm listening.
I know.
It's switched on.
Gracious me.
Ooh.
Did he drop you?
Well you'll have to put him down a bit more carefully than that.
Oh.
I'm coming.
What's your problem?
A fly?
Well I would n't worry if it's out there.
It'll go to the light.
Flies always like the light.
So it'll be flying round the light so it's no trouble to you.
He wo n't come in here.
They just do.
No.
They always fly towards the light do flies, so it's no trouble.
I do n't know, but they just do n't.
Come on, lie down.
I think there's somebody else at the door now.
It's chaos tonight is n't it?
Erm the front door.
Do you need to go to the toilet again before you go to sleep?
Jane is there someone at the door?
Jane.
Right, would you like to find out who it is.
Who is it this time?
Oh it's Dawn.
Come in Dawn.
It's chaos.
Yes I'm coming down in a moment.
I'm just just go in with Jane and have a nice time.
Ooh there we go.
Poddle in, make her a cup of coffee and things like that Jane.
If she wants one.
It's busy tonight is n't it?
You alright.
I do n't know, they're just coming to visit me.
Alright?
I did n't know it was Dawn coming at the door.
I thought it was a stranger.
I just heard somebody knocking instead of ringing the bell.
And I thought somebody's at the door.
Mm.
Right, up the ladders.
Oh goodness.
Ooh ooh.
Oh right.
Now do n't shout any more please, just go to sleep.
Right?
Nighty night.
Well in that case keep getting down here and there's the cup.
Right?
Yes.
Unless you can lean over without falling out of bed.
Well just do n't fall out of bed.
That's all I ask.
Right?
Night night.
Oh dear me.
Who's had a clairvoyant?
Rick was?
Oh he wanted to do it did he?
Oh Rick was trying to get rid of her?
I'm impressed I must say.
Oh dear.
I'm impressed.
This is Rick?
You'll have to remind him next time he decides not to bother coming that he's supposed to come in case.
So what you brought me then?
Ah.
You what?
Do n't leave it till the morning?
Why, what is it?
Is this from you or from Kirsty or from Graham?
But really it's not?
It's from you?
Aha.
Well next Tuesday's tomorrow.
Oh it's a bun.
Oh look.
Right I shall have let me go and get the matches.
I'm touched.
Helps if you can find any matches.
You what?
As opposed to this Tuesday.
Has it got no sugar in it?
Well the icing'll help wo n't it?
Right.
Remembering that my microphone is on and I will expect you all to sing.
After three.
Thankyou so much friends.
Can I eat it now?
I'll have it with me coffee.
There's gronnies lurking about in me coffee, I do n't see why I ca n't eat me bun.
Is that a child?
It's cos we've sung happy birthday, they're.
Ah.
He's got his cup of water and now he ca n't put it back on.
Just go and sort him out will you?
It's nice it's nice.
Mm.
It's very nice, I'm very touched.
Thank you very much.
I feel well loved.
Mm, has to be silly.
Thank you very much.
Mhm.
Oops.
At least not just now.
Are you in a car?
Where have you put it?
It's rather cluttered with cars is n't it?
Right.
Thursday.
Thankyou for calling.
Bye.
Oh yeah.
We might get this piano lesson done soon.
What with one thing and another.
So far we've not been it's not been like this has it?
Until today.
So that's pretty good going.
Just put it down.
Right.
Shall we start with the butterfly?
Again.
I just want to check your fingers.
As I was n't watching first time round.
And this time instead of speeding it up so we're whooshing off like a like a bee okay.
We'll go a little, trifle slower but rather than no it's not so much a trifle slower as steadily.
If we're gon na set off fast then we carry on fast.
But also there's a word here and it says.
lightly.
That means do not thump on the piano.
Right?
Butterfly, okay.
Just let me switch this thing off cos they do n't want to hear our piano lesson do they?
And I do n't think we want.
Well, when you fancy really.
Twenty tapes to fill so you can keep going forever.
Mm.
Well you would n't.
I mean they probably you probably would n't fill all twenty tapes.
Friday.
Mm.
Mm.
So far so good we've had erm church conference and been sick so I mean yeah that's.
wonderful.
Wonderful combination.
What, the being sick?
Unfortunately it was with Andy on Sunday morning so it was n't actually here with the noises.
Well there we go.
He's lost his front tooth, have you seen?
No you Dillys.
Yeah.
Carefully took it off me and washed it himself cos last time I lost it down the plughole you know?
Mm.
I know, well they did.
The fairies came anyway.
Mm.
Mm.
Big tooth this was so I think I left an extra five p.
for a front one.
Good that was n't it?
With his starter book.
It's good innit?
Oh fine, yet Jo was just saying on the phone there that she'd seen him in a catalogue.
Yeah, she said she was thumbing through this publications catalogue.
in her new capacity as head of department erm in the school.
They're starting a pre-prep thing.
You know she works for a choir school?
Oh no you.
do n't know anything about her do you?
She works for a choir the choir school at Durham cathedral.
And erm they're starting this pre-prep thing in September and she's gon na be in charge of it.
I mean that.
that means nothing at the beginning because there's only about ten boys and she'll be in charge of them all.
Her and her department, but expands.
then she'll be able to choose a staff.
But she's got to er kit it out and everything.
It's quite exciting really.
Well they will have in a private school cos if they do n't have the pennies they put up the fees.
Am I supposed to eat first or open these first?
Well, I'll just have to open something.
and then I'll open this to mummy bit.
To the best mummy in the world.
Ooh there's a Tim, I'm carrying Tim upstairs.
To mummy with love.
Happy birthday from Tim and Christopher.
Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss.

That's a nice envelope.
We'll have to hang on to that.
To mummy from Christopher.
No right we have to say thanks.
Amen.
From Christopher.
It's a big something.
Ooh gingerbread boy.
Seven and a half inch cookie cutter.
. That's nice.
Thankyou very much.
We shall have to make some biscuits this afternoon.
Oh it's a huge one is n't it?
Cor look at that.
When we have one of those we shall have to chop it into little bits to eat wo n't we?
Cos otherwise it's rather a lot to eat for one person.
Oh look at this one.
To mummy from Timothy.
Ooh.
They're dinosaurs.
I ca n't get into them.
Six dinosaur cutters.
Oh that's fun.
Six metal dinosaur cutters.
I think these are perfect.
Yeah, these'll be a better size for biscuits I think.
That'll be more of a size for a I do n't know what.
A very large cake.
I'm gon na put these in here.
I dunno what kind of dinosaurs they all are.
Oh yes look at that lot.
One of those, is that a pterodactyl?
I'm not very well up on my dinosaurs.
Do you know?
Brontosaurus, that looks like one.
You've got a book about it have n't you?
Well thank you very much Tim, that's lovely.
Did you choose that?
Oh lovely..
I owe you a cheque.
for however much it costs or whatever new clothes you would like.
Ooh.
That's a bit that's a bit risky is n't it?
I'm sure you can Tim.
That would be lovely.
To my wife.
Oh look here's all the washing.
I want you to relax on your birthday so first I'm going to do all the laundry next I'm going to do all the dishes and then I'm going to vacuum the whole house.
There's just one thing I need to know before I start what does a washing machine look like?
.I think you know what a washing machine.
That was a very good card where did you find that one?
Do n't you?
Oh you're determined.
that I should use my camera.
Film, thankyou daddy.
Oh the gingerbread family cutters.
Ah yeah but this'll be little ones.
That's a huge big one you see?
This is very special.
I'm not quite sure what to do with this one.
But I'm sure we'll think of something.
Oh.
I've put him in there.
You stay in there mister gingerbread boy.
Gingerbread family cookie cutters.
Yes?
Oh.
Ooh.
A baby gingerbread man.
And a mummy gingerbread lady.
Th that must be a little girl one do you think?
And this is a little boy one.
And that's a daddy one.
It is fun is n't it?
Well we've got a granddad and a one.
Well we've got that huge one then they go down in size all the way.
They're good though.
All we need now is some Ca n't get it back in the box now.
How do you make what?
The mouths?
Well you'd have to use erm.
sultanas and currants and things like that.
Or a bit of erm you know those cherries?
Glac cherries.
No no no no.
If you chop glac cherries you can make them up.
like a smiley mouth.
Or those orange and lemon things.
I think that's a little girl.
You can call her what you like.
Sally.
I ca n't get these back in now I do n't think.
Do they go this way round?
Lots of presents.
Cos look what I'm wearing, I'm wearing what grand and grandpa gave me.
And I got new trainers.
Look at those bright new white trainers never heard of before on my legs.
And this look.
You have n't seen.
these before have you?
You've seen them in shops.
Why wo n't this go back in?
That was very wise.
put those on there.
I think we shall definitely have to make biscuits this afternoon.
I think I'll just have erm something in my bowls.
I have to eat, as I open these other things.
I'd like Rice Crispies but we have n't got any out.
Er.
I did buy some.
But they're not in the cupboard?
They're probably on the top shelf in the cupboard.
No.
Thank you.
Superhero torch pens we can send off for now mm so.
Why, what did we have before?
That zapper thing?
Mm we've got a lot of tokens for that have n't we?
On my knee.

Collect all three.
Oh I think you get it in here somewhere.
Oh no start saving your tokens.
Eight tokens for one of these amazing pens.
Batteries not included.
No, you have to go and buy your own batteries.
I do n't think you need any sugar do you?
We've got loads of batteries floating round at the moment.
I do n't think there's any milk in there.
You do n't need sugar necessarily do you?
Do n't take it all in the same place.
Mix it about around a bit.
China?
Oh yes dear.
I had n't noticed to be honest.
I'm impressed.
You mean it was n't cos the last lot was n't washed up?
You did did n't you?
It was very nice.
I think it was a hint.
that we need some extra cooking going on in this house.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh look, grandma's sent me something that you can push out to stand up.
You have to push those things out.
and then they stand up.
Mm.
No.
Mm.
Yeah?
Is it?
Right.
Just a that was clever.
This is just a friendly hi and then inside it says from I, and she's made it into Irene.
Why is it a sharing one?
Why's it not mine?
Oh.
Mm.
It's granny and grandpa with a great big bouquet of flowers there.
What?
I'm doing my best, but I ca n't eat and open cards at the same time.
Mm.
Except this one.
And I had swimsuit from grandma do you remember?
Whoa!
Money from Auntie Mavis.
I know.
It's very nice is n't it?
Oh dear.
Auntie Mavis has only been out for five to ten minutes twice cos of her knee.
You know she's got a funny knee?
Mm.
Erm.
And mummy will have a whale of a time.
What?
Mm.
I'm gon na come for you for lunch from school.
And we're going to go out for lunch.
Tesco's.
But daddy's having lunch at work, are n't you daddy?
special at work.
Look at all those sweet looking cats.
There, on that card.
When we're in Tesco's we'll have to make sure we've bought the ingredients for all these biscuits we're gon na be making for the rest of the.
I'm impressed.
I do n't think I've ever had a card from Keith and Sue before.
How did they know?
It's known as a hippo-bath-day on this one.
Mhm.
Can you what?
Watch something on the telly?
Is it not exciting enough having me open my presents for you?
Ooh.
We have n't heard if Jill has got our present from us.
I mean.
Do you think it's cos she has n't?
No, but when she sent this you'd think that maybe she would put in it.
by the way, thank you for.
Mm.
It's mine.
Nothing in it?
Ooh.
Ooh er.
Foam bath gel.
Forget-me-nots.
Three sachets.
Three sachets of Woods of Windsor concentrated foam bath gel.
Empty the contents of one sachet under running hot water and enjoy a fragrant relaxing bath in the luxurious foam with Tim helping you get washed.
Danielle.
This looks very superior.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Yes.
What do you mean too late?
I got it early.
I got all these things early cos when I was at granny and grandpa's they gave me some money.
And I was able to go and shop without everybody else helping.
You all went on the minibus and the train.
with daddy and I swanned around the shops.
With daddy.
And I went round the shops.
And my swimsuit.
Do you remember I bought my swimsuit, my blue one?
Well I'm not wearing a swimsuit but I'm wearing the other things.
What, the swimsuit?
Yeah.
Has what got money in?
It's not a purse love it's for erm soap and you know toothbrushes and things like that.
I like it without.
I can take my own stuff in my own bag, yes.
And I like ma mine without margarine.
Erm.
Well we all share together do n't we?
We all share together really.
Mm.
True.
But I ca n't think of an occasion when I'd go by myself.
I ca n't think of a time when I would be going by myself in the near future.
Why ca n't you have marmalade?
Well leave that.
Oh I've put it away.
Well you ca n't have it love.
He wants daddy's knife to use for the marmalade.
But he ca n't cos daddy's already put it in the kitchen.
In your tummy I expect.
He has n't had any yet.
He's just trying to get it in.
No.
You have n't got one.
You're the, you're the little boy who was sick the other day.
Oh.
No you were n't sick were you?
Come on you, get that marmalade on there.
Shall I help you?
Not now it's alright.
Not now you're not.
Not now.
Oh.
No you're not.
Oh only normal.
If you were cold you'd be dead.
Mm.
If you feel cold you'd be dead.
You just are.
Part of you being alive is that you're warm.
Mm.
Mm.
Well they've usually got er lots of clothes on have n't they?
You've got pyjamas on and.

Nobody's got dressed yet.
Well I have.
You've eaten your toast.
Is there?
Well grandma has cos she's given me a swimsuit.
People keep giving me money you see and I keep going and spending it so so it's not quite like your birthday cos on your birthday you get lots of presents do n't you?
Hello daddy.
Do n't look in the fridge near the bottom.
Right.
Right.
I have n't even noticed you'd put something in there.
It must have been in there last night.
Oh just this morning?
Where've you been this morning?
Oh.
But then you thought you'd better put it in the fridge?
Right.
It's these two that will go looking not me.
Yes dear?
I dunno.
You've had.
I think he should only have half actually.
he can get back to normal he can come home and have a big bit of toast.
Well who's fault's that?
Not ours.
Actually it belongs on my plate Tim.
It's mine.
Thankyou.
Or Who's the King of the Jungle.
I'd like Who's the King of the Jungle.
What do you want?
We'll start with that one.
I beg your pardon?
It's meant to be a drink of coke.
You need your eyes testing.
Mhm.
Right.
Be bold.
Be bold.
Be strong.
I think I'd quite like a little bit more please.
If you could pour some tea in the tea in the milk I mean I think I would like it.
What are you doing to all my pressies?
Ooh.
Mm.
Thank you for the card.
Bubye daddy.
Mm.
Go on then Tim.
He has n't.
If you open the door quick.
Mm.
There you are, he's going now.
Come on, quick.
This is crazy.
Timothy come round this side please and you go round that side now.
Tim, this side please.
You're not to climb on there, you've got to go past it.
Because it's silly the way we're going on.
Yes.
Just leave it and come and sit on your seat.
Come on.
Sit in on your seat.
You do need your seatbelt on.
Put it on please.
I know it's not very far, but even so.
If we have an accident you'll need it.
bump into another car.
You've put your stick in the porch?
Right, that's okay.
It's still there is n't it?
It does n't matter.
Do n't worry, just leave it there.
Have you got yours in?
Is your seatbelt on?
You'd best put it on quickly.
Well in the garage it's a little bit different because there's only the garage to hit is n't there?
So if you hit the garage you're going very very slowly and you might just give yourself a jolt but you would n't hurt yourself quite so much.
What's what noise?
The car.
It's cos you're travelling in a Metro.
You're used to travelling in a Rover.
You're used to travelling in a Rover.
This one's all shaky.
It's so old.
But it does the job.
Gets us there.
Ah hey.
No it's fine.
There we are, there's Mark's house.
Right.
Now have you got all your things Christopher that you need?
You stay there Tim.
Do n't go undoing things.
No you just stay there cos you can get on Christopher's seat when we come home cos he wo n't be here.
Come on.
Can you shut the door.
Shut the door.
Sounds like in the bedroom up there.
Ha thank you very much Mark.
Thank you so much.
Sounds as though you're lively this morning.
I think he's alright.
He was sick on Sunday.
By the time yesterday came round, by lunchtime he could have come really but.
You never quite know do you, how they're gon na.
He's gon na go swimming anyway so that'll put him back if.
Bye.
Has he not shut the door?
Perhaps he's going to wave to us.
No I think they have shut the door, have n't they?
We'll go to Tesco's today.
I want to get some petrol.
Mm.
I wonder what you'll do at nursery today.
I wonder what you will do at nursery today.
Games?
There'll be some games there.
What's your favourite game?
Postman Pat snap?
You have n't played that for a bit have you?
It'll be in the drawers I expect.
You can always go and get them out, if you want to.
It'll be in the drawer.
Well I do n't know.
Have you looked for it?
Well if you go and look for it I expect you'll find it.
Do you think it'll be sand or water today?
Do you think it will be sand or water today?
Do you think there'll be sand or water today?
You think it'll be sand.
Why do you think it's sand today?
It was water last week was n't it?
So it probably will be sand this week I would think.
No, you wo n't get soaking wet with sand.
Hopefully.
No.
Do you?
What, so that it sticks together then it makes things?
Mm.
If it's dry it sort of wo n't stick together will it?
It wo n't make things.
Mind you it's nice for pouring.
You do n't have to have sand but it's rather nice.
No we're alright.
We do n't need petrol right this minute.
Cos at lunchtime we're going to go to Tesco's.
And that will be a good place to get petrol cos it's cheap and we shall need a bit then.
We're not desperate for petrol but it would be nice if we filled up with it.
Yeah.
Going to be one person.
Which means.
Ooh.
There's an ambulance.
Yeah.
Or it might be taking somebody to hospital.
Did n't seem in much of a hurry though did it?
So I do n't think there was an emergency.
Come quickly cos there's a car on its way.
Here.
That red one.
Yeah.
Come on then.
It is a dustbin day.
It's not a dustbin day for us though.
Our dustbin day was yesterday.
Can you hear the wood pigeon?
The ducks are here today.
No, no ducks out today.
They must be still asleep.
Where are you gon na go?
What are you gon na do?
I know.
I know.
It's the same all the time.
are n't they?
Where are you going to go?
I think it's the initial sort of shyness of it all, you know?
Going from one place to another.
Ooh.
Sometimes.
Are you a clever reader?
She ca n't cope.
What are you going to do Tim?
You do n't know.
How about a Postman Pat jigsaw, ha?
Oh I know what you fancied on the way over was n't it was it Postman Pat snap?
What are we gon na do dear?
Well it's my birthday you know Lil.
Mm.
So I'm wearing my birthday things, you know?
Thirty five today.
Thank you very much.
Well they were n't.
They looked it but I got.
I got erm however much money it is off you know.
I was.
walking down the high street and.
Well it's Thomas today he's got.
Come on really.
Thank you.
Or something.
Right.
That's nice is n't it?
What are you gon na get then?
You fancy what?
Postman Pat snap?
Shall we have a look for it?
We're going to root in your drawers for Postman Pat snap.
Is that alright?
Norman.
Norman.
I think those are jigsaws mainly in there, do n't you?
What's this at the bottom here?
Shall we have a look in a different one?
Try this next one down here.
Have a look in there.
Excuse me dear.
Thank you.
Can you see it?
I think it's all jigsaws in this bit.
Do n't you?
Shall we try the top drawer?
Would you like that one? rooting about in your drawers.
Have you found it?
Would you like that one instead?
No.
Shall we shut this drawer then and have a look in a different one?
Excuse me.
Mind your fingers.
Oops a daisy.
That's it.
Let's try this top one cos we did n't look in here.
Oh this looks promising.
What's this?
Is that it?
Goody, hooray, mummy can go.
I'll see you later then now.
Anyway, have you had a good time?
That's for you.
A G M minutes.
Erm whenever the A G M is.
It's for you to study and peruse so that you.
you know.
Well I know, I think it's a good idea.
They're giving them out beforehand so that, so.
I know.
Well there you are.
You can look now and have your questions at the ready.
Oh, why what happened to it?
It's been very windy.
Those are the mums and toddler tea towels.
I've washed them.
I bet you have.
Why not?
Oh it's private.
Right.
Shall I switch it off then now?
Oh I do want to know.
Just before you tell me about yesterday.
Just let's get today sorted.
You know when you go to erm collect Christopher from school?
Instead of walking back down to our house.
go down towards the pub.
No.
No no no.
Go down the path to the pub.
You know at the bottom?
The Jolly Farmer?
And wait in the car park down there.
Cos that'll save me five minutes.
Well, you know when you get up the top you come out the school gates.
and you turn right.
And then instead of turning left down towards where we park the car,.
keep going.
Straight on.
There's a path goes down a slope.
You follow your nose down to the bottom of there.
Then you turn,.
well you just follow the path.
It turns right and into the car park.
No.
Yeah?
Well you'll see at the bottom of that hill that th there's the Jolly Farmer sitting in front of your eyes.
Well I should think so.
I do n't think the Jolly Farmer does meals.
But I thought if you do that then I can turn in that car park.
at the Jolly Farmer.
And er.
pick you up and then we can sail off to lunch.
And it'll just save us a few minutes because it'll be tight squeeze I expect.
Yeah.
Oh no.
Right.
Two girls.
on a train.
Mm.
Ooh dear.
Dear.
She perhaps thought she was going home.
Going away.
Dear.
Oh.
Oh I see.
Mm.
Was taking her away.
Oh dear.
Well at least it was nice that they were looking out and.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh right.
Oh that's good.
That's handy is n't it?
Mm.
Mm.
From your front door type of thing?
Oh.
Mm.
They do a dial-a-ride in Redditch.
But I've never used it.
But anybody can use it but under under seventy or something you have to pay so much.
You know, like go to the hospital with it or something.
Mm.
Mm.
Do they do things on a regular basis?
You know?
Mm can only say no.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh dear.
What did she do after that then?
She went gallivanting off then after that?
Oh.
Right.
Oh did she?
Oh I remember you saying that.
Oh dear.
Oh right.
Mm.
Mm.
How old was she?
Oh dear.
A corn on every toe.
Dear.
Mm.
She probably had, mm.
It's too late though now.
Oh very good.
They improve with age I.
They did, yes.
They might have them might they, might they when they've finished all this refurbishing?
Oh I see.
Mm.
Lift.
Decrepit.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh.
So everything was coming in on different lines?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
That's the trouble with Birmingham.
Because it's where it is in the country, any catastrophe up or down.
upsets whatever goes on in Birmingham.
Right.
Are you gon na get your coat on and.
keep talking as we go.
Think it's yours.
Mm.
Shall I take this?
Oh dear.
Wonder what it was?
What factory?
Have you got the keys for my house as well as yours?
Right.
Well, no you wo n't.
But I'm just checking.
Do you like me gear?
No no.
This is what I got at erm in Exeter.
The swimsuit that you bought me.
Colour.
I got your card by the way, oh I said that already.
No, not yet.
We got some.
Oh.
Oh.
Well no.
I've had the trousers some time.
Well they're newish.
They're probably the newest pair I've got but that's not the point.
Erm.
Come on dear.
Just get yourself in this car else we'll be late.
Oh, sorry.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll drop you off at the Jolly Farmer, then you can walk up the hill to get to the school.
Then you'll know the way back.
wo n't you.
If you ever find the school that is.
Well it's twelve o'clock you see.
Yeah.
I do n't think he'll have noticed your absence.
He was so ill on Sunday.
Well he was n't that ill.
He just got feverish in the night really.
He seemed to be over it much quicker.
Oh he's alright.
We both survived.
Gritted our teeth and made it through the weekend.
Oh no.
Just have to well just certain times when th could, just could do with a holiday from them.
So the wedding, how was that then?
Oh dear.
Were they wearing their thermals?
Yeah but the bride I mean.
It's the in thing though is n't it?
Off the shoulders and.
A nice girl.
Oh yeah.
Yeah they'd all be there would n't they?
I'm sure he has.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They had a fire at Saint Leonards and they've been saying that really it's been a good thing.
Cos they've had to rethink what they want.
Cos otherwise you're tied by you know.
preservation orders or this that and the other.
There's no preservation.
Oh no wonder he wanted you to set off early.
No wonder he wanted you to set off early, he did n't know where he was going.
He did n't charge you for all that?
Oh that was nice.
You must have looked the type.
I expect it was packed was it?
No.
I bet.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Knew where to get extra.
interest.
I'm sure, you know, with Alan and this new building, he's been very good.
Because he's known the right people.
And when things have turned up and they've not been quite right he's known.
There's something sort of practical about him.
You know the.
No.
Mm.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.
Thought you'd be late.
What time was the wedding?
What time was the wedding?
Half eleven?
Oh twelve.
Did you have elevenses before you set off?
Did you have elevenses before you set off?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Just pleased you'd got that extra space.
You're not worrying about rushing off.
Well you've got nothing to rush off t for have you really?
Yeah.
Have they found out any more about how it started?
I'm taking you to the Jolly Farmers.
Which will give you just about the right amount of time then to walk up.
You'll have a nice walk ready for your lunch.
Okay now, if you go on th this path whoops it's gone.
It'll be underneath the floor.
Wait a minute.
Good job I brought you.
Well it's under the floor.
I mean it's erm you go, the underpass is there you see.
Can you see the grass there?
If you walk straight across that bit of grass there you'll come to the path.
Well there's no point really cos you have to go backwards and go under the underpass and then up there you see.
You're going, yeah.
Well the underpass takes you left if you see what I mean.
But you do n't, no.
You want to go u you see where that big tree is there?
You want to go across the grass and you'll hit a path which goes left up there, past those houses.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just that.
No it's alright, go on.
You walk up towards it and when I see you.
disappearing round the path.
You'll see the path across there.
Can I tell you what we're going to do, cos we're gon na do something nice.
I've just left grandma to go and collect Christopher from, from school.
And we're all going to go out to lunch together.
Have some lunch together while Christopher's, in Christopher's lunch hour.
We're gon na go to to Tesco's with grandma.
Have a birthday lunch.
For me.
Yes, with Christopher.
And then we've got to take Christopher back to school for the afternoon.
And then we'll go.
and then we go back home with grandma.
Because today Christopher's not having his lunch at school.
He's gon na have it with us instead.
But he still has to go back and work in the afternoon.
Who?
What do you mean, who?
Christopher has to go back to work this afternoon.
Because it's school time.
It's school time till three o'clock.
I'm going a different way are n't I?
Do n't worry we'll get there.
It's just a different way home, that's all.
Cos there's lots of different ways from the nursery.
Going to pass the water tower.
We have n't what?
It's there.
That's it.
Ooh.
What's the matter with you?
You're all stroppy.
Did James put sand in your eye?
Oh dear.
Was that an accident?
You're always getting sand in your eye are n't you?
I think you must rub your hands in your eyes or something.
No.
Did Lily help you?
Gwen?
Oh.
Just you?
Is it still in there now?
Is it still in your eye now?
Oh dear.
If you blink a lot that helps to wash it out.
Blink a lot cos it helps to wash it out.
Well it's a bit tricky to put water in your eye.
Just blink a lot cos that helps.
That wa.
that washes your eye anyway.
Here they are look.
That's right.
I'm turning round here look.
Quick.
Be quick.
Who's gon na go round?
He can climb through the middle.
Have you had a good morning?
Oh.
That would have been quicker would it?
Have you had a good morning sir?
It is, it's not very far.
Did you have to wait for ages?
Oh.
I expect he said there's my grandma.
Anybody else going home today for lunch?
Have you had a good swim?
No, no point in bringing swimming things now.
Did you have a good swim Christopher?
Bit silent.
What have you done this morning?
Swimming?
Yeah.
It was n't very long?
Oh.
Why was that then?
Was it?
Did you get out and warm up?

I hope it's not.
Yeah?
We're going to Tesco's.
He's not got himself sorted out, Tim.
He's a bit bit erm.
bit baffled are n't you Tim?
Yes that's right.
Well you say silly thing but how else is she gon na get across that road?
Cos they've not exactly put.
they've not stuck an underpass or anything have they?
And it's a pretty horrendous road.
Well there are always a lot of cars on it.
So there's no no chance.
Do n't believe in zebra crossings in Redditch.
We have n't got any you know?
Those pelican crossings that, we've got one or two of those.
We could have one of those.
I think we'll have a mass trip to the toilet before we go into the cafe.
You want to go again?
it's even better there look.
There you are.
It does does n't it?
But I had n't really.
It was a bit cheating.
It was a bit cheating.
Right, what do we need?
Just money and us do n't we?
Yeah.
Mr did n't decide.
to take your patches off your trousers again today?
Good.
Oh right.
What have you been doing then?
Sticking glue.
glue.
Glueing what?
Do you want some help?
Ooh.
Somebody else coming.
Right?
Are we all locked up?
Are you alright?
Having troubles?
You what?
E K W.
There's E J W there.
With a J.
Here.
For my birthday?
I got some biscuit cutters.
Mm.
Dinosaur shapes and gingerbread men shapes.
So we've got to make biscuits all afternoon.
Yes you did.
That's right.
That's right.
We're all going to the toilet first.
She's examining what she's going to eat.
Did you all go swimming or were there a lot of you not going today?
Mm.
Who went?
Mark went.
Good.
Have you done any reading or anything like that?
Well I hope so.
Sorry, do you want to.
you have one.
You just carry on in this one look.
Do n't worry about our family.
We'll all go in to the one.
Oh you've taken your coat off.
Right.
He's taken his coat off.
No we do n't need to lock it, come on.
There's only us and a lady in here and she wo n't be coming.
Is there?
Well grandma will sort them out.
Is there anything coming?
No?
You're alright are you?
When did you wee?
Did you wee at at nursery?
Right.
Right.
Would you like to tell grandma.
Ask her if she'll do your face for you cos you're a mess.
While I just go to the toilet.
You got as far as you were at the wedding.
Oh let's have a look yeah.
Might as well because this is a good time while he's rushing around on that.
Oh yes.
How many were there, the guests?
Oh, very nice.
Mark Richard Samuel.
I did n't realize there was all that lot.
Did they oh no.
Couple of hearts, how exciting.
Oh!
We had that one.
Who did?
Irene?
What are they?
Oh my goodness.
Right.
Keep them quiet.
Here he comes.
He's found a friend look.
He's found a friend.
Found a friend?
Have you found a little friend?
Do you want to go and play with her?
Chase her.
Oh dear.
Are you going to stand them up for me Tim?
Right, let's have a look in this parcel then.
in the garage.
I think we'll throw this bits and pieces away.
Yeah.
Twenty pounds from Aunty Mary, I know, she should of been generous, should n't she?
She's got nobody else really, so normally you've got.
I think I've been given it er some good cause rather than.
well, yeah I know.
I mean we're not sure.
Mm, it would be.
There's a very sweet one from John and Chris have you found that one?
Do n't think they will all fit on there will they Tim?
stamps off for you.
Yeah I'm going to getting the stamps off these en envelopes cos I have to put all these in a hurry in the end, also got loads of time, then I realised it was half past ten, no wonder I did n't get anything at home forgotten where we keep them.
Chris and John.
well I'm always calling them tweedle dum and tweedle dee, hey do n't throw it at the house, it might be something fragile.
It come through the post it probably is.
you take the brown paper off and this is the wall paper underneath and I'll take that bit off.
right, when you get to the stamp make sure you do n't rip the stamp, cos they need the stamp, stamp of the stamp.
mm I expect to be here.
Pauline and Steven and Pauline and Tony, remember Pauline came to see us, little girl, oh look we've got a plant arriving with a brown leaf on it in there.
are they meant to be mouldy like that?
Do you?
Yeah, but it says do n't take the top off for twelve days, when did I la, when did it come out.
It will be tomorrow wo n't it, fortnight.
Ooh, gently does it.
Whatever it was just the way I did it.
No, this is my bit now, cos it's my, my present.
Ooh it's French, I think that's just going in.
I do n't know yet, it's very exciting.
Tim who's birthday is it?

It's a bath gel, very posh daddy will be interested in these stamps, we've managed to come across some French stamps.
No, I.
well it's in a French box.
So do I, I think the box is only because it's here we are.
that's a letter for looks like a card smells nice.
Oh look at that, I love birthdays on a badge, to Aunty Dot, hope your birthday is lots of fun for you, filled with many of, happy things and nice surprises too, right let me wear me badge I love birthdays there we go that can stand up somewhere, I do n't know where, we're running out of space.
the gingerbread boy is n't it, we've got the man.

a rose garden, celebrated fragrance of the rose.
recreated in this soft.
Can you smell the.
Oooh.
this thirty outdoor Freshers suitable for small gardens.
bulbs that's nice.
planting time March to April, that's.
I'll have these Freshers all the way down the side near that erm middle wall, thought to myself wonder what I could have done there that will look pretty.
You know near the fence on this side.

Freshers would be nice.

Oh look at these socks.

That's a thank you letter for Ann's birthday oh very kind was n't it?
I did rather well there.
What's this one, do we have to take the lid off it, we do do n't we, or do we have to puncture it?
No, it is n't, it smells nice enough with the lid on, but I'm sure it should come off.
Oh it's got sellotape there.
Oh it's that display open attracted container.
Whey hey.
Phorr put these on the erm.
I thought I'd put them on the window sill I think.
you do n't need to smell close, do n't get too close it's quite powerful.
he shall walk in and daddy will say oh what is that beautiful scent, we will say it's the rose.
It's nearly ten to six are you going to come with me to get Christopher Tim or are you staying with grandma?
I think he needs constant trips to the loo grandma.
Yes I am too, it makes a.
Make a nice change.
We'll also go to the park where there's nobody else.

Look at Michael.

Good Chris look at this, I know all my work, a smile and a star, good gracious.

Done those ones, done all these, we've done this one?
Well done Christopher.
Have you done that one?
They've done these two.
Yeah I got those.
Oh this is your photo, oh look at you, how sweet, preparing the press block that's nice in it?

We bought it with to show oh you did n't get, it's ever so good he got it out and he read most of it ever so well it's lovely.

It's a good story, very funny, it's like that woman who started out being a window sill.
Does everybody know?
Fine, thanking you Sharon, it's very kind.
I'll go home and blow my candles out, come on.
Well no I threw the old ones away, cos they were getting holes in them, here's Mark's mum hello, all well?

it's a big one that.
I get another star, thing is he does n't actually, I can remember them cos he can read them, I do n't know whether she's got them wrong for the test it's a bit of a really is n't it eh? come on.
He said it was cold, was it cold?
You found it cold.
but it was cold when we got in and even colder when we got out, so if we all go down with pneumonia that will.
Say no, yeah.
that you realized.
I bet they forgot to put the heating on something earlier or, service that and not got.
So you were in for ten minutes and rushed them out and out again then.
Yeah.
well considering we were sick the day before I shall think that will really do us in.
There's a heater in there is there?
Oh well, you mean heat in the changing rooms.
There's one in the just by the er, the changing rooms, the, the erm lockers and I always choose a locker that.
yeah, yeah I always choose a locker that's between the.
I always pick that little spot to get changed in, oh, well see you all then, right, bye, bye Mark.
Oh bye, oh hello, are you waiting for your mum or do you go home by yourself?
Bit of both oh right, that's a good idea, see you Gone the wrong way a post box got a letter to post.
Oh we will unless we've gone down the wrong hill We'll have to practice the window cleaner one if you're going to read it to the rest of the class, have to practice the face and read it with expression so they do n't all fall asleep oh hello, hi.
Oh it's.
and that's my eldest.
I've got a new one tonight, I do n't know how we're gon na cope with this, we've got, we've changed schemes now, we're into the Oxford.
I like the Oxford it, the stories are really fun.
Yeah.
If I do.
and yeah we'd like to keep ours till September, I do n't know if we'll ever get, we will get a free new one ever?
Or do we have to have, we have to pay our ten P's, to park.
Oh every year, oh well we've got a long time to keep it going, within about the first, within about the first month daddy managed to get the iron on the top.
on the left carried on.
well that's I thought when I saw it coming out I thought oh goodness this is gon na be ten P a week, that's the same for everybody, very good.
and because it's slight yellow you do n't lose it you know, if you keep all your stuff in it at home you can see it under the chairs and you know huh, find it again.
We, one does n't try to lose things, but they just happen do n't they really I think I appreciate more now, you know when I was, when I was teaching I used to think oh stupid woman she's not, to bring this book in and you know, and now I think oh dear, huh, yeah and you also appreciate the people, I would appreciate now those who managed to do it every day without fail, manage to sort of let, because they must of put themselves out no end to have.
done it as opposed.
to those who think oh blow I ca n't find it just tough mm.
no hope we do n't lose it on that Tim, it's got all my money in at the moment, it's a really good one is n't it, we're really enjoying it at the moment does n't what number it is but we just, what do we do with this?
Something seven, sixty seven perhaps even or seventy something, anyway whatever it's got money has n't it?
It is.
yeah, well I was gon na say those new five P's are but you see you just get the new five P's and low and behold they will produce something else.
oh yes.
He's got chicken pox at the moment I think.
I think she's probably just come out for a quick stroll, we wo n't spend our time over that at the moment, hello.
alright?
Yes, ours have, yeah they probably passed it on in fact, kids probably passed it to them.
weeks ago.
Tim you mean?
Oh that one.
Yes.
I tell you something I was amazed at erm the reading book he appeared with, Fluff and Nip and goodness knows what that went out with the ark when I came out of college, I do n't know whether they're all reading that or whether it's just sort of found them and must of been just perhaps a one off or something, but, I was amazed.
no I do n't think it is, I think it's probably got.
yeah.
it's the moral, that's right, and the moral sounds, sounds good does n't it, I do n't know if it is, but it just sounds it I suppose.
no, no.
yeah.
yeah, could well be, I do n't know what it is.
no and I, I think particularly this new head seems to know exactly what she's doing, where she's going, I think it's excellent so I'm sure she's working everybody to death and I think that's brilliant.
well I was worked to death.
when I first came out of college and I really appreciated it.
you know you had high standards and you knew where you were aiming for and that's what I want my kids to go through as well, you know, somebody who's gon na do their best.
mm.
that's right, that's right.
yeah.
that's right and you know that if the staff has put theirselves out to make a decent crash in their environment they're gon na go mad at the children if they muck it up, so therefore, you know, you're gon na have that.
yeah.
mm.
right, right.
it's a bit bad that.
yeah, well I was there the other day and erm the bell went and nobody sort of moved and I thought I think, I know, you know, so I got up and I washed me cup of tea like, you know, they looked at me as if you know oh there's a keen, but I mean I do think it's important to do that, because not only that it's not fair for the.
dinner ladies, because I mean they're stuck out there you know doing their best.
yeah, yeah.
yeah.
I aim to get things there on time.
mm.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah, you mean the children and the say rather than.
the staff.
yeah.
oh yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
yep.
yeah.
they probably do n't get up until quarter to nine, see they have a struggle really to get there on time.
to get here for nine o'clock every day, yeah.
it's five to it says on the bits of paper.
but then the bell does n't go till nine, although sometimes it goes at two minutes to nine and sometimes it goes at five past nine.
they say something different or something do they?
Cos sometimes I think we've got hours and we hear bell going as we're coming up the hill and we think oh dear and then, you know, other times.
we'll be sitting in the playground for ages, well standing in the playground for ages.
Yeah.
yeah.
right, OK.
bye.
Hello pardon?
It's mixed is it?
I told grandma that's what you want.
got some goodies in there.
I had it the coat, I've just taken my coat off.
ah we have n't got any biscuits have we?
Do you know why we have n't got any biscuits, have to be one of those,.
I'm not sure we can actually make ginger bread, but, I'm not sure we've got any ginger but we could certainly make some biscuits is what we've got.
You can make some men but it just wo n't taste of ginger.
do you like one of these ca n't be making biscuits.
have you seen this?
She's a scream she loves doing this kind of thing, does n't she,.
Would you like one of these biscuits grandma?
We're not going to make anything right this minute, cos first of all we're going to sit down have a nice cup of tea and Christopher's going to read to me, so we're going to get that out of the way before the excitement thing happens.
I know where the cake is but I'm not allowed to look.
Mm.
Oop, what does it say that on the back for?
It says cold but we do n't know why.
Thank you.
Now then grandma, you go into Smith's and buy yourself an Art and Craft Magazine, you'll see your grandson in there on page whatever that is, page twenty eight.
It's a little one now, this is the Art and Craft Magazine, you know they did, this is a child's education copy, they probably still do it Art and Craft.
Yeah.
Oops well that's it, that's the one.
Well that will be it I should think.
we shall have to ring er the grand parents cos they wanted a copy, we're supposed to get a free copy of the magazine we think, but they photocopied that for us just for fun.
the school has n't it, cos it came through today in school.
that's what I'm saying to you.
I did n't realize he'd be on his own in there.
look who's doing the whole lot apparently he just had to do, he just had to model that, he did n't get a chance to do it properly.
Yeah.
So he just came to.
Oh dear, what's the matter with Tim?
What's your problem Tim?
I do n't know, where would you like to put your drink?
What was it, was it a birthday cake or something with candles?
I bet it had candles there in the summer, do you think?
Can we get a mat for that, cos otherwise it makes a mess on my chair.
I've seen the ah he's found the.
There's a mat on the settee there Christopher.
on the settee, and that will do.
Do you want this on here?
New magazine, which Tim choose, but has decided not to read.
They took them at school, all at school.
The magazine?
You can get it in Smith's if you walked in.
walk into Smith's and ask for Art and Craft April edition publication and if they have n't got any spares they will order you one I expect.
or we'll get you one, or you could get it through your local news agency.
No they will never get it will they?
OK, you gon na squeeze in this chair with me to do our reading.
Mm, probably might.
Could be for Ruth, it's Ruth's birthday.
Three day's time.
Could be for daddy yeah.
My daddy might feel left out of it.
Have you seen my badge look, Aunty Gwen and Uncle David sent me that.
saying I love birthday.
Yes.
Mine is, is this James?
The be bald, yes.
She's old, they make a load of rubbish out of it.
Come on, where you gon na sit?
Now then, Christopher's got to read this to class tomorrow, Mrs said, so we're gon na practice.
Right, you've got to make it sound really interesting, let me switch this thing off cos they do n't want to hear you read again I do n't suppose.
Right, I think we'd better move this sugar, we're not gon na have enough room are we?
Right, can we just move it a bit, cos we've got to make the mixture we sort of have to do.
There's plenty of room right, just gon na put, I was gon na put the rice up here cos otherwise there's not gon na be enough room.
Pardon?
You have n't washed your face?
You sound to me like a tired little rascal.
You can help darling, do n't worry.
no trouble, alright, do n't cry, OK?
Alright, there you are right are we happy now?
I do n't think we're gon na have Thomas very well we're baking can we?
Send Thomas away somewhere in the shed or.
boo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
I do n't know whether I'm going to cope with you two.
You two, sshh, if you two are gon na help me with the biscuits, then we ca n't have rows about Thomas can we?
Can we put him with the biscuit cutters over there?
Well it's just tough.
Right we need golden syrup, we need some margarine, can you pass me some margarine out of the fridge, there should be a block of margarine.
in there somewhere.
No well do n't look, you wo n't be able to see anyway because it's in a bag.
caster sugar.
I do n't appear to have any caster sugar, that could put the end to.
gon na have to use brown sugar, that's all we got.
right where's the scales?
Suppose depends what time we.
depends what time we get around to er, getting it done.
ooh, three hundred and fifty degrees, I do n't know what it is.
we'll guess it, centigrade, right, what else do we need?
Golden syrup, margarine, sugar, plain flour got some of that somewhere what else do we need?
A pinch of salt.
ginger bread not really, baking powder we got, a bit of bicarbonate soda we've got.
well we're not having any ginger bread men cos we have n't got any ginger, huh, well we're just having sort of nothing really.
Mm, that's right.
a pinch of salt in there.
you.
Eh, I do n't know, hold on, cos I ca n't find any carb, here are, there's the baking powder.
my has disappeared.

right, change of plan.
change of plan, we have n't got erm bicarbonate of soda, so we'll have to self raising flour instead.
let's just see whether we should use powder or not.
eh, what are you doing, you're gon na end up in, having a salty biscuit if you're not careful, do n't do it.
right.
we'll do the margarine first, were did you put the margarine?
There we are, it had to be a block.
there's a block of margarine somewhere here, this one.
can you see that please, can you make total of eight there, we've got wait to orange like thing goes round to the eight.
yeah, can you see it Tim?
Which eight?
No you're looking at the wrong one, this eight down here where it says eight and then there's an O and a Z, that's eight ounces which is about two and something grams, we're not worried about grams today, in ounces, oh, think that will be enough?
I think, oh, no.
try some more.
no.
try some more.
nearly now.
yeah I think that's about right, do n't you?
one more, how's that?
oh no, that's enough.
worried about that, right is that ready to go in the pan, if somebody would like to put that in the pan.
thank's Tim, do n't tip it on the floor.
sort of blobs, so be careful.
careful, whey.
right, sugar we need now.
six pounds of the sugar OK, you ready?
Oh dear me, look at, just.
let me see what's happening, that big notch there that's number four, now we need another notch five, and another notch six, whoops, stop mummy, too far, but never mind,.
right that lot needs to go in the pan until.
Let Tim cos you did the margarine.
Whatever you do do n't make a mess on the table,.
I know.
gon na let as well.
What else do we need?
I think we'll just wipe that mess, mind your fingers you dilly.
mind your fingers out of the way.
Does it?
Right, wait a minute now we know yet we need, oh we need the golden syrup.
oh dear.
can you go down and get that back from him?
Why not?
Where is it.
there, now this should be interesting cos we're gon na get in a sticky mess here if we're not careful, eight ounces.
blob, blob, blob, blob, blob.
blob, blob, I think I'd better do this one Tim, I have n't had a go yet.
ooh.
sticky wicky.
do you?
One of you, one of you can lick the spoon and one can lick the bowl, plate.
When you've got the off.
there is golden syrup in this thing, I need to get.
OK.
through your fingers are you?
Try not to use too many fingers, just one.
come on syrup.
right you know what you've got to do with that lot?
Melt it, so where will we put it to melt it do you think?
Hold on Timothy.
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Yeah you can lick the bowl.
you lick the bowl and there's a spoon for you.
There will be a lot on it Tim, be careful, do n't let it get everywhere, cos it's so sticky.
Yep.
when it comes at tea time you wo n't be hungry will you, cos you've eaten, ate all this?
Right now where we gon na put this do you think to melt it?
On the cover.
on the cooker, in the drawer.
should make a nice, am I not very good with it,.
now what do we do?
Flour, salt, ginger root, we're not doing, baking powder and the bicarbonate of soda, right, what do we need excuse me.
no I do n't get a fourteen we need a big spoon.
We might not be able to use our shapes until tomorrow which will be a pity wo n't it really?
I think if you share that there, the two of you.
I think you've probably had enough actually, you get he's, just have one, one little bit, put your finger in, and then we're gon na put it in the, er three fingers put it in the wash.
OK, I need somebody to beat an egg.
Mm.
You can both have a go.
anything?
well we only want one egg, but.
what you have to do is, Tim have the first go, we have to stir it round like that with a, with a fork, OK.
Can I wash your fingers.
you can wash your own fingers.
Roll it out, when you get a rolling pin and roll it out, that's when you need the cutters to make the shapes you see.
Here you are Christopher your turn, can you mix it better?
Make sure the white, hold it still.
Right, do you want to see how it's really done, let me show you, watch, are you watch Tim, then you can try, watch.
you hold it like this look, hold the, the cup with, with the handle.
and you hold your fork like that between the and then you just whisk it.
you go round and round very fast.
that's it, fast.

Right that's there all we need now is a little bit be melted.
Yes, melted.
Not do you want to see then?
It's not quite finished melting yet so I'll just bring it over to see and have a look, can you see look it's still all bits, lumps and margarine in it.
Can you see the lumps of margarine?
Those lumps well that under there, can you see that?
Do n't make sure I got all mix in and then that, the other.
together.
It looks like, hardly mixes it does it?
Because the margarine is all on the top.
Right.
Now this should be interesting, tip this in here, sometimes you got to put this in, sometimes you got to put egg in.
I'll put it nearer to you and then you'll be able to, it's really a mummy job this I'm afraid.
Well it's gon na, mm, yeah, well it's not pastry cos it's flour I think we've mixed it really, I know what you mean, we are going to tip it out of the ooh.
Ah.
Errrrr.
Oh, come on.
We'll have to be.
Mm, yeah.
Mm.
Now that's the big stretched can you, if you just put your finger on there you'll see how sticky it is, can you feel it's warm and sticky and.
If we put it in the fridge it will make it go all cold.
and then it wo n't be sticky, I ca n't roll it out to make those shapes at the moment cos it's too sticky, yes we're gon na have to stick it in the fridge and when it comes out it will be just ready then.
I'm afraid we ca n't do any chopping up into biscuits, I should of checked the recipe before we started really should n't I?
Yeah, well it does n't matter does it?
Oh we did n't do it in the morning, I was going to do it tomorrow night when you from school.
Wednesday, yeah we've got to tomorrow after school.
What do you want to do?
Weigh it up.
Take your fork out it will weigh less.
If you take the fork out it will weigh even less.
Where's the margarine.
amount.
Do you like that or not?
What?
You just take my cake.
Say.
Oh, ah, oops careful, cos you just spilt a load of stuff on the table.
Is that raw egg you're eating, do you like it?
You can beat raw egg you know, like it.
Shall I put that back?
Did you?
just put these in a box.
Put these in a box.
When I read the recipe it turned out I have to leave it in the fridge over night, so we ca n't have it.
and me.
Yeah.
well I did yeah, I did erm one the other for Christopher's school, but I, I did n't realize there was too much erm syrup and stuff in it so erm to do it quick enough cos it's too sticky, but you have to roll it out it's all.
it's not easy, you know how you make pastry.
sugar in instead, well there's I'm not.
Well I'd put the oven on already, but I did n't read it properly.
I'm so hopeless.
Well you might if you're lucky.
Switch the telly off.
Oh I do n't have a cake so I the sandwiches to.
that will be.
I did n't wear, no was n't wearing till lunch time was it?
So it must of been this afternoon when.
The Jolly Farmer.
Amen.

That's.
said of driving all the way back round to collect them, he said I could walk down to the Jolly Farmers.
that's half way to Tesco's and they would have time to be there.
How about some margarine first?
No,.
Nothing, just dropping the jam and the salad cream everywhere on the new pottery, well it's not that new any more is it, so.
I just asked him if he wanted margarine and he said no.
Mm, mm.
I'd like some chicken roll please.
No, no, it's alright thank you I'll just get.
do you like them?
Good, would you like some bread to go with it?

How was day?
Oh.

You managed to get out for your paper or whatever or is that asking to much?
Oh of course silly me.

She did go home, you said.
she did n't dare not.
She, I bet she did n't dare not come, after you said.
Well yesterday apparently he told her that she had better turn up this morning cos of her excuses.
Let's see if she's in work tomorrow.
Is she that bad?
Poor girl probably die in.
You want some more coleslaw it's not good offering you that son you wo n't eat it.
Do you want a lid to this or just holding it Tim?
Do you want a lid to this or.
you just holding it?
I chop it for you?
Chop.
Mm, mm.
Five?
Good, very pleasant really.
No.
I read the ingredients and I thought oh that's good we've got all those things.
so we'll use that one.
so we got all the.
but we that matter.
Ghosts.
oh dear.
Mm.
duck.
You mean talking with their mouths full?
Sorry we're so excited.
In the book, no eggs here, oh dear, yeah, it says we're going to.
look for the eggs with the ducks, and it says no eggs here, oh dear, the.
that ducks do have eggs it's possible they could of been there but they were n't.
Yes they might be lucky.
Oh you enjoyed Christopher's reading book today.
Going to the toilet.
I see.
What have n't I shown you?
Oh sorry, I will it's just upstairs is it.
I know.
Well look, I've got it all in my sort of purse ready you see, and I went off to town today and you know what I bought?
Nothing.
I was n't there long enough really.
I had a very happy time looking at things I did n't want.
Mm, I was n't fussy that I.
I was enjoying it, but I just decided this was not for me.
That's OK cos I got another another time wo n't we?
Mm.
You've got loads of bread.
Some pan?
Wish he'd make his mind up.
Well we know what you've said.
But I did n't go to town till half past ten I was going to me mother's at half past eleven, so there was n't a lot of time.
Was happily pottering about there, did my own thing, I had to open about nine cards when I got home, I did n't think at all.
do that by myself without any help.
Mm.

You just bounce, bounce over there.
What cream?
Salad cream.
Careful cos it's all in the lid, I think he needs help because on that lid take, take it off it will all flop out.
When.
Just a.
You wants some bread, you've already had two pieces.
Do you want some tomato?
Do you need the toilet?
No, sure, have n't been for a long time have you?
Have n't been for a long time, no, I'm not more.
Oh dear.
You want bread what did he have for lunch?


What do you think dear, cos this child keeps moping on about bread.
Anybody.
You do, like your daddy.
Half a piece each, ravenous hoard.
Happy, what would you like on it?
Pardon?
Cheese, tortilla cheese or cream cheese.
Cream cheese please.
With or without margarine, no margarine, just cream cheese, easy.
There you are.
What?
Cream cheese is n't margarine no, you can use cream cheese instead of without.
As you like really so you're whacked out dear?
He came home and he just laid the table, very impressive.
I did try and move because of what you said.
You do n't.
I've got to wash up.
When it's your birthday.
Some of it.
No, we went to Jolly Farmer, dropped my mother in the Jolly Farmer and then I went up to Holly Cottage to collect Tim, then we went up to collect Ti Christopher.
Because we thought that would be quicker then you see collect it.
Yeah.
and then we off to Tesco's and who did we see in Tesco's once again.
Mrs,.
I think she must make a permanent hotel, we're there, she's there.
She was pretending to Mrs today, at school.
There's no Mrs is teaching Mrs class cos.
With her dad, daddy was off work today down there.

You not having any cake?
Would you like to sit down and watch and see, watch.

Right, well just watch me have my cake and.
It's apple, apple or apple, helicopter.
The banana's are not meant to be.
Well there's apple and the cake is it wet?
cos I wash them.
Yes please, is the helicopter sounds as if it's going to the hospital, oh yes, look there it is, ever so close, can you see it Tim?
Probably.
Well sometimes they fly things in and fly things out.
Like kidneys.
well it's true, that's what they're doing just the while we're having our tea.

Are we meant to eat these before the cake, is that the idea?
Or is that what everybody's doing?
Yes, you carry on talking while we chomp.
It's a place I really like.
Well do, do a lot of the trains go through Banbury?
I thought they would oh.
there will be quarter of an hour so it's.

I'm excited.

Alright, want a snuggle woggle instead?
Oh I thought.
Were you thinking of taking a walk with it?
Oh I see, go on then.
Carry on, do n't bump into daddy on his way this way.
There's only me and you left at this table.
Right.
Is it excited, are you going to sing for me?
Oh that will be even nicer.
Collect appearing and disappearing.
Daddy, I think we need some new plates here.
Dread to think what the cake's like, dread to think what sort of cake we've got.
Oh thank you.

I know the ginger bread boy cutter is rather large, I'm not quite sure have to do it.
A painful I shall have to use it fairly rapidly.
How?
Yeah I could do then use the bits for pudding or something.
It's got a sort of metal bar across I do n't understand why that would be, why we have a little metal bar across.

Time, six, ten.
You like it do you?
Good, how old are you dear, thirty six?

No, sorry.
It's one and a half years.
Right.
Mm, what are they pictures taste like?
Mm not too bad is it?
Is this a spare knife?
Did you know it was gon na be chocolate?
It said so?
Probably why.
Mm, the lady at the checkout when I got Tim's that time, do you remember, cos all the birthdays come together and I saw that for Tim so it make him one.
I bought one for Tim, it taste quite nice, the lady at the checkout said it would, is that you kicking me or the.
Do you?
Yes please.

Oh.

How old is Gilbert?
He looks extremely young, is he.

He looks like twenty three to me.
What, do you want the toilet?
No, just need a hug.
That was very nice.
You're not often very cuddly are you?
That's right.
Mm you'd want more than would you?
What's fourteen?
There be twelve, there's eight there, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Mm.
mm.
Mm, I like that.
Oh.
Well worth the I suppose dear.
You did very well to have gone birthday and get home in time for, whatever time it was you did.
Did you?
They have n't got any thing have like, no, I tried that with er Tim, cos Sainsbury's would of been really more on your way would n't it?
It's probably because.
a shopping Sainsbury's.

They might have them frozen in the frozen bit, frozen gateaux and stuff.
But it's not quite the same with sort of birthday cake with a fancy thing round it is it?
Mm.
Christopher staring again.
Well I, I think they will give it to us, cos er, Martin what's his name said that we'd get complimentary copies, yeah you must n't touch those Tim cos those are matches and children never, never touch matches do they?
Because if they suddenly catch fire guess what would happen?
And you as well.
and you'd get very sad and it would hurt a lot.
Mm.
Yes.
and all our things.
Well we but the house would n't would it?
Yes, it can do.
But it strikes on particular things, it strikes on something rough, but you never quite know, know what, not, no good trying it out because you never quite know whether it's going to strike or not, when you get to be older, we'll allow you to strike a match, but you have to be quite older to do that.
we'll show you how it works.
I'd rather be around at the time.
Mm mind you some children fish about it in cupboards do n't they?
You know high up.
Hello you back again?
, what do you want now?
You want me?
Why have I got a light on?
Well we wanted to see what we're eating.
Somebody switched it on I expect, we wanted to see the cake did n't we?
I never did, I never do.
Daddy I think.
You had your eyes shut.
Do you need the toilet yet?
Well you must do soon.
I expect so.
Do we really need any more telly?
Twenty past six already.
Well I know I said but, I did n't realize what time it will be, why do n't we wait until tomorrow morning and then you can watch P C Postman before you go to school?
That will be an exciting thing to wat look forward to.
Move it quickly.
forward a bit.
It went long ago.
Then you'll lovey, let's get you a book, read you a story and pop you in bed, mm?
No I do n't want to I wan na watch the telly.
You want to play a bit with dad?
Oh good gracious.
When you wash them.
give them a good scrub.
Mm, as opposed to a little dip, good scrub.
Oh you find something.
Looking, well I'm just.
It seems a shame, yeah, yeah nice innit.
A shame to pull, shout them out behind the curtain.
er?
Oh.
it's only the brick.
it's only the brick, do you want some help wash washing up?
Chris and your with advice as to where to get thousands of candles should I need them.
I do n't know I was n't listening.
Mm.
go on then.
They've got the numbers here look, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
No, not for twinkle, twinkle little star.
I do n't think you can play one, two, three, four, five on there can you?
I do n't know, just have to play it on the piano I think before you oh Tim, what have you done dear?
We have made a mess, you will lose them, you're right.
Just dropped all the gear down there.
if you're interested, then we can do that in the bath, can you put them in the box first.
you did n't mean to do that, it just happened.
got to put them all, yeah well who's going to put them all back in, daddy's helping look.
you go and help him.

Are n't you playing the piano? shall we get that book that you have, it's yellow I think it's down there, we have n't done that for a long time have we, we can do that while daddy and Tim are playing.
Should be, yeah, somewhere on there,.
no on that flat pile.
on the flat pile bottom, no, bottom of the drawer, the book.
I think so, I do n't know what that is.
Read the classic beginning of the book.
Now where was I?
On the piano.
I knew it was.
Mm, it would of been better really, but never mind.
we'll just be thankful for what we've got shall we?
Actually I'm not very fond of the school piano it's.
Did you find all the keys?
Find.
Line them with your little finger on the other hand, or your thumb on the other hand will do.
that's it find them on your other hand, your other hand.
find them with your other hand.
Yeah, just tells you about finding the C's, can you find them with this hand?
Find it with that one.
This is the middle C's really.
Where they come right, that's the one with the right hand, this one, in the middle.
you have to do it with that hand.
key in the middle, why?
In the middle of the piano, you're not.
sitting on the chair properly.
and there's three there.
I know it does n't work quite like that, that is the one OK, can you take the other hand, that's that one.
Put a right hand on that one.
Just do one there, do n't panic right now.
the one where you do where we going.
One, two, have to count four, do you remember?
One, two, three, hold it on while we count four two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
Remember, OK?
One, two, three, four.
Brilliant, OK.
I'll show you how to play with the other hand.
Practise.
We're look at the wrong music.
Yes.
Brilliant have a go.
Hold on, you did n't count before we counted three.
Erm, if you just leave it out somewhere we'll put it away.
Just leave it out.
that right,.
oh now then, do you remember the clock.
before you have to count two there then another two there, it goes one, two, three, four.
What, you start with your other hand, start with your right hand that's it.
that's it.
you've got it.
one, two.
and again.
one, two, three, ah, ah, ah, that's the, still the same hand there, you have to do two with that hand and then two with that one.
Yeah, OK, right ready, one, two, three, four.
one, two, three, now swap hands, one, two, three, four, let's start again.
Yeah, go on.
That's it, brilliant.
OK, can you do all that lot then, while I do this little bit?
Alright, go on then.
Well you tell me, that one's your right hand, that one's your left hand, which is your right hand?
That's it.
That's your right hand and that's the top one there, this little squiggly thing here.
one, two, three, four.
That's clever, well done.
Right, OK, see if you can do it with me messing about down here then.
Hold on, give me four.
brilliant that was.
Now have a look at it and see what you've got to do with that, got to go one, two, three, four.
with that hand do you know.
That's it.
Well it is except.
you've got to go one, two, three, four, clonk, clonk, clonk, clonk.
That's it, and then swap hands.
Yes,.
brilliant, OK, right let's see.
how we go.
give me four to start with, I shall.
keep that hand ready otherwise you'll discover that it's not there when you want it, use it, OK.
hey, hold on go steady with it one.
four,.
Well done, you had a technical hitch in the middle, but we did that, we got there oh now then, do you remember this one?
Yes you did all of that, you did all about the.
I do n't think we did this one properly did we? you only use your right hand cos you push on that foot.
yeah, look, there's a C remember, then it changes a note to a D.
That's it, find your C.
And where's your D?
That's it, but use this finger this time.
You do more or less go like it.
but not quite, we shall just have to see how it goes.
yeah that only got to count for four, that's gon na go one, two, three, four.
then to D one, two, three, four.
back to C, but this time only two one, two.
then D one, two.
then up again one, two, one, two.
and then you've got to go bomp, ba bomp,.
Yeah, go on then.
Mm.
Cos supposed to be a.
Perhaps when you hear that bit you'll hear it's still like a train C, D there C, D, C, D, C, D, C, D.

Well done, that, so that goes for four, that's for four then those go one, two, three, four, like that you see, but it's four.
down there, do you want another go, with me doing that funny bit?
Shall we have a go and see what happens?
We might have a disaster but it wo n't matter we can try.
Four that one, that's the four, that's the four, that's the two, that's the two, that's the two, that's the two and that is a one, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

How's Tim, cos he does n't sit down properly.
Have you seen the butter Tim?
He's kneeling up.
It's just that I'm saving.

It does n't matter what?
No, I would n't eat half of an apple.
Will you sit down on your bottom.
Yeah, would be when I'm away.

You have a half of it so the whole of it.
Oh no you do n't.
You'll get it'll be half a whole, get me a bit confused here.
I did see it on the.
No,.
Oh dear.
I forgot to.
Oh dear.
I spoke to that was Monday night, yeah, she's been head of department, did I tell you that?
Oh right, I thought I told you then.
Oh, well she rang up, I've seen Christopher in the catalogue.
and.
and could ask if publications can.
We've seen the book.
she's got, on the, yeah.
he's in the catalogue.
Oh, oh no, you're getting confused, you know the book that is out, that is on.
beginning careers, well it is in a catalogue, the book is in a catalogue, yeah, so there's a front cover of the book sitting in the catalogue smiling at her, saying please buy this book of Christopher.
Yeah.
We do n't want to buy it, we just want the catalogue.
So she's ordered it because.
she's started Liam, they're having a pre-packed school at Durham choir boys, whatever it is, cos he's from school, apparently the locality of demanding six year olds and under so they and another la labouring school.
Put it on there, oh it's too late to put it on there, oh that's alright do it like that.
You can use your cloth daddy.
Yeah.
No.
What are you.
Do what?
What do you want me to do?
Just leave that on the plate like that, that's fine.
It's when we're going to take it in the kitchen and put it away when we've finished.

Right, just, she said she's going to be head of department, it starts at ten OK, so she'll be ahead of herself, then as she'll be responsible for getting staff said she still has n't, got she said, little love.
Timothy wanted the whole dear.
Oh that's clever.
Oh dear, yeah that was my fault, sorry now if you have my plate then you wo n't have any trouble with that erm, what.
seven, eight year old boys at the moment, and she will teach children under.

I guess she really liked those, she only got moved because of er the.
Hurry up cos he wants the margarine, can he have the margarine while you're spreading on?
I think you've got enough there have n't you?
Mm.
Did you?
When we've had half a whole, I'm thinking half a whole.
No they've got half a whole.
Yeah.
You were dear, very clever.
Well there's two different wholes are n't there? chop toast you can chop either that way or that way.
That's right, there will be four then, four bits, life is so complicated.
Ours do actually.
What would you like now Tim on there?
Seemed to have got rather a lot of margarine on there, hope you're going to eat all your toast today, not like yesterday.
the margarine.
you've got margarine what else would you like?
Rice Krispie in where?
In my tea, oh yes there is, soggy, it's out.
I do n't know.
Probably dropped in when we were shaking them in the bowl, Rice Krispies seemed to get everywhere, undo the thing and there's Rice Krispies everywhere,.
It's a hoover day today Tim.
We have n't clean for ages.
so we'll have a go at it today.
You're gon na help me, you're gon na stay here I'm afraid.
Me and you doing the cleaning in the morning now granddad's off.
You're not going anywhere, you're staying here.
Bulbs, er probably not cos I think I'll have to do while you're at school cos daddy tells me it's gon na rain this afternoon, I'll have to do that this morning, pity that.
Because it said on the packet you'll plant them immediately after buying and we do n't know when Aunty Gwen bought them and it might rain tomorrow as well, I think I ought to put them in while it's fine, now.
in the ground, I'll save you a couple if you like, you can plant two by yourself.
Mm.
You want to plant them, you can help me plant them cos you'll be around.
It seems pity to go to school and not plant bulbs.
Yeah, there be me and you planting bulbs and cleaning the house this morning.
Yeah it's a jobs morning this morning kitchen floors a good thing, we'll have to kitchen floor Tim, that'll be fun wo n't it?
No he'll be at school, just me and you, scrubbing away at the floor you'd rather do it with Christopher would n't you?
Sorry about that.
Mm, well he wo n't because you'll be at school.
you'll have to wait till the holidays and then Christopher can join in and.
Mm.
When you what what, say that all again.
Oh that's ages away you know, it's not till May, you can go two nights at Jo's.
Go on Saturday.
No.
stay Saturday night and Sunday night and we go back on Monday.
but we wo n't be going home, we'll be going to York.
Mm, mm.
Cos we it's a long, long way to Jo's and just to go, right all that way for two nights would not really be worth it.
A wise man built his house upon the rock, a wise man built his house upon the rock, the wise man built his house upon the rock and the rain came tumbling down, and the rain came down and the flood came up and the rain came down and the flood came up.
the rain came down and the floods came up and the house on the rocks slid down, but the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the rain came tumbling down.
and the rain came down and floods came up, the rain came down and the floods came up, the rain came down and the floods came up and the house on his band fell flat.
Mm.
Are you ready?
Lord Jesus, thank you for a nice sleep, thank you for another day, please help us to do the kind of things that you want us to do, prayer for Christopher to behave at school, help him to do his best and for daddy at work, for Tim and I as we stay at home, help us to know the kind of things we do and this afternoon when grandma comes we'll spare the time for her as well, Amen.

Yeah oh I'll enjoy that, it'll be a nice little trip please bring.
a packed lunch, coffee will be provided, no funding available for travelling or subsistence costs, typical.
they always do this on a supplies teacher, you have to go because you want to do it.
Well this is a cheek really because I should imagine it's one of the most.
over subscribed courses as well, I mean when I went on the language and, and the national curriculum and that other thing that I did on the national curriculum, masses of people there.
I did.
Are you happy to do it, are you away or here?
Fifteenth of April.
I was hoping they were n't gon na put it on a silly day.
Is it?
When's Easter then?
Oh, it could well be then.
Oh will she be here.
Right, those poor need feeding again.
Oh I'm really pleased about that, cos last time on a, I was really disappointed I'd been refused the course cos I thought oh, it'll be right up my street that, cos when I was teaching full time I was quite into these er computers at the beginning and the one that went.
miles out.
It's not too much, it's fine, you watch them gobble it down, only because it spreads out.
because they've been so much more technology, you know, since it's started.
I do n't want.
Yeah, and er, apparently there's a thing called in the afternoon it's called erm software for survivors.
Sounds like a good scheme.
Ah here's Jo's birthday card.
Oh dear, terrible.
here's hoping your birthday will be unfrogettable and the frog hopping about on it.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh that's very nice, a book token as well, three pounds.
I like a book token cos I always feel a bit guilty buying books you know, cos I've got so many.
And then goes to the library to get the book she wants.
If it's a book token that's it is n't it really?
Who we talking about?
No, she said in her letter, that she has n't, well it was just a little square of paper, what are you doing dear?
Oh running round the room with a tape measure.
Huh, Michael gave Gill erm a sun bed.
a sun bed for her birthday, to encourage her to rest.
cos she wo n't stop, she wo n't put her feet up, you know she's pregnant.
You know she's pregnant?
She still rushes about like I do n't know what.
So er, he's given her a sun bed.
I think that's rather clever.
Oh we were fine last night, we just sat plonked in front of Inspector Morse all night, you know, every time the er.
it was nice video is.
but we just got the.
the, erm you know like when the telephone goes and you think oh rats I'm gon na miss the programme.
you can, wonderful, so every time the telephone went, which was quite a few times, we stop it and then we, you know, we fancied supper in the middle and oh it was nice.
Well play the game with me, well it was very pleasant I must say.
It's a luxury though, I mean you know, you do n't need it, the fact that we got one for Christmas it was very nice, but.
No, and so, but you can choose what you want to use, to watch the video I mean I find it particularly good with children, we'd.
hardly ever watch the children's programmes official.
We you know we watch bit's and pieces if we.
Yeah, the Really Wild Show yeah She ca n't manage normal size.
No loads of little ones.
when she goes out for a meal she's got a problem, now if that was me I'd be having loads of big ones.
Oh dear, quarter past.
This little friend?
No, he kept waking up constantly, you, did n't you?
You kept shouting for mummy or daddy or somebody.
You're a silly.
He seemed to be awake for a long time, I think, you know like you wake up and you do n't know what to do with yourself, I think it was like that, so every quarter of an hour or so he kept me, shouting for a drink he did n't know quite what to do with himself.
Oh that's a very nice letter, I was just thinking that maybe erm Jill has n't got her birthday card cos she's the type of person who would write and say thank you, you know to me.
She has got it and it was a lengthy letter so, but I thought it would be included in my birthday present.
but she's not, she's done it separate, in fact I think that second class stamp.
Oh yeah.
She's going to carry on till.
first of.
May.
Cos.
She's got six weeks, well you can go on it when you like really, well, you.
no well, what they do is they tell you the earliest you can leave and then you can leave after that if you prefer.
Right.
I was lucky, cos I had the summer holidays.
included in mine, so it meant that they paid me for the summer holidays cos I did n't officially really.
I had n't officially stopped work till the first of September.
I got paid for August which was quite clever really cos my date would of been sort of half way through to book my holiday.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Oh he's been.
crayoning.
he's been doing a blue track sort of something.
That's because I did n't have time to sit and colour with him so he decided he'd do it all blue himself did n't you?
Yeah you can go and bring something else done.
I only brought that one down because we have n't seen it for a long time, just choose one.
thing that you want to play with do n't just bring down any old thing.
A game perhaps, that'd be nice.
Have we got time for a game?
Mm.
Well we might do.
Exactly.
but I'm not erm, putting myself out, it's like like April the fifteenth and everything.
Does it say I've got to do anything about it or does it say I'm on it anyway.
No, I do n't think so, if you are unable to attend on this date please contact Janet at ITS Worcester, well I am able to so that's it then, enclosed a map, look forward to seeing you, jolly good should be exciting, I'll never find me way round Kidderminster.
Oh yeah, oh I said I was very keen Zian Hill, School.
Oh yeah, he's done loads of it.
Mm, I think they have a system whereby they have it in the classroom for a week.
and then somebody else has it, so it's sort of once a month or something it turns up and they have sort of an extensive thing on it, I think that's the way it works.
Oh that's nice you've brought the tractor down.
ca n't make out where this school is.
down Birmingham Road, there we are,.
I can see it.
Who Tim?
I do n't know, I hope so.
It might be on the top.
on the shelves.
Regional accent there, regional accent.
You're not now, it was true when Tim was mm.
Thirty odd years in Manchester is definitely er.
Pardon?
Oh, I feel quite pleased having cleaned everywhere and popped I feel like I can embroider the rest of the day now.
Till some sort of disaster happens I think.
It's always such a hassle you're trying to do something and you're just gon na have.
got to provide activity.
Oh.
It's a play or to deliver home?
We do n't have any erm Chris has never bothered us bring people back from school, I do n't think he knows them that well, well I mean he does know them, but they're not really his type, you know,.
What?
No, I mean he's quite happy being there with them.
and I've heard him say oh can I go and play with such a boy, he said he likes going to Kirsty, Kirsty and Hannah and Kirsty and Graham he's quite fond of them too and Adam.
and all those really.
are sort of his type of player.
see what I mean?
He gets fed up if people do n't play properly.
Likes to set things out and make them go you know.
rather than throw it about.
quite a certain little somebody we all know he's toys do it, no I put it there.
They played ever so well this morning did n't you?
What were you playing this morning when you got up, you and Christopher?
Did n't you have a game?
Was it snakes and ladders this morning?
Oh no it was a tractor thing was n't it, or did you play snakes and ladders as well?
Mm.
He fell off to sleep.
Huh, good ai n't it?
Yes, there's definitely there some proving, mind you, you'll have to pick the right time of day, do you know what I mean?

I'm doing quite well really, I'm quite good.
Do you have to or meal or.
Well I do n't know, cos he's suddenly decided he likes yoghurt I think.
He used to love yoghurt.
and then he went off it,.
I do n't know.
You want a yoghurt with apple, your gon na start with a yoghurt are you?
There you go, there's the yoghurt, I'll get you a spoon.
I'll be pleased if you like yoghurt again Tim, pardon?
Mm.
Well he's like that different taste, never sort of with Christopher stands for what he likes and what he does n't like, shall we mix it round a bit more to mix in?
Yeah.
no.
Do you like it?
Oh good, perhaps he had a funny flavour or something that's put him off.
I know when I was at you just had one thing with a funny flavour and that'll put you off that thing.
Well.
I think that's got slightly more ooh we got the er, the what's it group tonight have n't we?
Wonder if we've got any milk to give Morgan, oh no we have n't aha, when I take you home we'll have to get some more milk, otherwise we'll be stranded tomorrow.
Come on, would you like another coffee cake?
No, it seems to bit filling.
Oh.
I'll have a yoghurt first.
Same as yours, yeah, I've given up buying funny flavours now I just buy strawberries cos nobody ever liked them.
Well I like, usually I like three out of the four and then nobody seems to like the fourth.
so I have to.
Christopher likes black cherry does n't he?
That's his favourite.
Mm, mm.
No, you just like strawberry do you?
You're like your mummy, I only like the red ones really, strawberry and raspberry.
I do n't mind black cherry.
No.
I'm not fond of things like apricot and nectarine.
Huh.
fruits of the forest I treat with great suspicion.
I'm not fond of pineapple ones either.
I like pineapple and we like.
yoghurt, but put the two together yuck.
I think it's things with big chunky bits in I do n't fancy which is silly really cos that's the fruit in it, but still.
Mm, oh, sort of international things at the.
mm.
Mind you they do n't taste the same as.
the family size.
Mm.
June.
I took her class on Friday afternoon.
She's been away all week.
every time I got to them they had about twenty odd teachers there at the.
the last teacher will be.
they wanted me for the whole day of Friday but I said I'm sorry I can only do you half day if you're interested, they were, they were desperate.
No they would n't be when I'm des when they're desperate, everybody rings me when I'm.
well I do n't want too much, see what I mean.
having told them to stay at home with Tim, I do n't want to be.
Well it's quite fun just going off for the odd day cos then he goes off to see Ian, he enjoys that but it was two afternoons last week cos I did Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon.
I've a, well she's dumped hers on me.
I mean she's got two children to dump on me so, I do n't feel bad about that in, that we know, we decided that's what we, we did n't mind doing and there no trouble, if fact they're less trouble cos they're together than they are.
no, we're just talking about when I did last week remember when I went teaching last week and you went to Ian's house did n't you?
Went in two afternoons.
Yeah anyhow I think she's hoping to come to tomorrow cos erm, idea in the air that on Maundy Thursday instead of having an ordinary mums and toddlers we'll have a in church for half an hour and then a run around cups of coffee with the big toys in the hall, a good idea.
That'll be a nice idea, it's a bit tricky, you remember the Chris what we did at Christmas, that went really well, and we thought perhaps something similar book for Easter, yeah, do n't know what we'll do but cos people like John and, so he's not teaching full time, in fact some of the schools have holiday are n't they?
Well she was n't going to and then the elections got in the way.
Well we still do n't know about that, and it said in the paper that they're having election in the church hall, nobody in the church knows about it.
So if they do n't act, they've had it, but, if they wrote and asked quick then.
Why a caretaker?
Why ca n't they?
Oh, they will have to if they want to wo n't they?
Well in that case I expect, you know, some of us could become a caretaker if they're having to pay us.
That's alright, open it up and then what do you do keep puffing along and sweeping it up whether it's put.
cigarette ends on the floor.
there not to smoke in the place.
but I bet they will.
Are they?
Very good, I do n't see why we could n't be really, it's so horrible for everybody else.
We're desperate for those at work.
Mm, I've noticed that one.
Well that's sensible for.
Oh.
Mm, mm, of the King's Cross Society you could have a King's Cross.
in Birmingham's Station could n't you?
Mm.
Is that what all this refurbishment's been about?
With grandma?
Something else on the telly with grandma, what will it be grandma?
Twenty past one what do you normally watch, Charlie Chalk no?
Probably watched the video did n't you?
I know something at twenty past one on B B C two but I would n't like to say what.
he probably do n't need to watch the telly for the rest of the time.
cos we done not a lot this morning like I just sort of be zombies, I'm sure we could do play with.
You've had enough now, let me have a look.
Just half of it, still none the less is it.
Well why do n't you finish this first?,.
I do n't.
think you should, I do n't think that we should have an apple if we're not finished our yoghurt, do you?
Well if you've had enough that's it then we'll lose it and we do n't do anything else cos we ca n't keep doing that leaving half a bits and that, this and that.
Well you, you've been doing a lot just recently, the last few days.
Yeah having bits of things and then saying I've had enough and then having something else you know?
I know, I'm not into that really I think if we sort of thing, we eat it, end of story and if we do n't want it fine, but you do n't have.
anything else as well.
as it goes I'm happy to go to Tesco's on Friday.

Only half what love?
No, I'm not breaking into an apple if you have n't finished your yoghurt.
No.
no, cos you're getting silly with this.
and we do n't get silly with our food in this family.
So you can either, either have the rest of your yoghurt or nothing.
Well finish your yoghurt if you want your apple as well then it will be full wo n't it?

I think he's has loads and loads of things had a lot's and lot's to eat.
you've had a lot and lot to eat.
You just forget it and you can have your apple tomorrow, I'll save it for you, right, there you are I'll put it back in there and you can have it tomorrow.
that's Tim on it.
Do n't do that.
Oh dear, what, nanny dusted your crumbs on my nice clean floor that we scrubbed together.
Mm, Tim and I did it together.
oh no, no, no.
Mm, plonk.
He's getting quite good at it falling, fallen.
He managed to remember hid and hidden this morning, instead of hidded.
me did it and Mrs not me did it, I did it, no not you, me.
It's really confusing, cos kids are they'll all of been in at play time today wo n't they?
Erm, probably horrible and the play set.
What when we go and see it?
Mm.
Yeah, the snag is the last couple of weeks, someone's has.
snakes and ladders, does n't go on too long.
that's our home produce snakes and ladders it does n't go on too much, it only goes up to number thirty.
Yeah, well go on too long do n't they?
Well just looking at.
I made that for Christopher when he was.
Can you do what?
Not right at this minute cos I can only have four at once, but after I've had this four I'll be choosing some more people, I'll be looking round for somebody who's.

That one's Keith's and that one's now listen carefully cos before we start we need to talk about something, just put your things down on the table alright?
Now what we've got to do, we've got to decide which things are going to float, what does it mean to float James?
What does it mean to float.
what does it mean if you're going to float, what will happen?
It'll float on the top wo n't it?
If you're going to think what happens, goes down under, now then we've got to decide what we think's gon na happen before it happens.
Hold on a minute, Kevin what have you got there do you know?
A sponge, it says sponge on there, what do you think might happen when you put your sponge in?
Do n't do it, just you tell me what you think might happen.
You'll think it'll drown.
you'll think it'll sink do you?
You'll think it'll float do you?
What do you think Theresa?
You think it will float, what do you think?
You think it ca n't float, you'll think it will sink.
What do you think Mark?
You think it will sink, OK then Kevin shall we have a try and see what happens?
It floats does n't it?
Just leave that in there, that's it remember it's floating.
What have you got?
That's it, you've got something there, what's that one?
Spoon it's a plastic spoon there, do you think that'll what do you think will happen to the plastic spoon James?
You think it will float,.
Float, what do you think it'll do Mark?
You think it'll sink, what do you think, no just leave it there, what do you think Gavin?
You think it'll float, what do you think it'll do.
You think it'll go down, sink.
float, go on then James see who's right, oh who said it would float?
You did, well that's now we've got.
Now what do we have float, so where does the float there, OK, can you put your label next to it.
that's it, there you go, that's lovely, what have you got there?
A brick, it's that it's wood, it's wood wood, would like to sort of feel it?
It's wood.

You tried it before?
You know do you?
Go on then Theresa.
what's happening?
It's floating, it wo n't sink will it, so where do we put that one?
Where shall we put it?
Put them back safely to there.
So we need float, yeah but it's.
What's Gavin got here?
You think it'll sink? float, what do you think Kevin?
Feel it look, it looks quite.
Float, what do you think Robert?
Sink, ok, go for it Gavin oh.
what's happened to it?
It's sinking right to the bottom is n't it?
Can I have a look inside it, I reckon there look,.
See what's happened, hey, hey what's this?
A broach you've got.
If you put it in really carefully so the water does n't get in, you watch what happens, watch what happens?
It's floating then down in the water, then what happens?
See, now what we gon na do with that then?
Can you remember about the shell Mark, what happens when we put the shell in?
It did both did n't it?
Can you remember what made it sink to the bottom?
Rock yes, what made it float then?
That one says float, do you want one that says float?
That says the same as that look, float.
See, float, float.
That says sink, now then what you gon na do with all the sink ones then?
Going to go in the sink one, the plasticine, you do the plasticine in there, you've lost the plasticine label, there it is.
Now then, Gavin.
You're not listening to a word we're saying, you've done sponge, that's good, now what else float?
What else float?
you do n't have to draw round it, just draw a picture of it with a nice broad stem and a round head, now Mark what was left?
Is that the shell to go in both, good idea there Mark.
What are you going to put in the floaty one?
This is your floaty side, there's a cork look, that floated did n't it, so you could put cork.
then you need to write cork next to it, draw a picture of it and then write it.
This is the floaty things alright, even the shells that's good, what else floats Kevin?
Can you show me what else floats?
You put that one in the sink, sink, so let's hope that's the thing that sinks.
Could that be a piece of plasticine?
Right, what's in here now James?
Right this is.
this is the spoon and what's this one?
The play doh, the plasticine, what happened to the plasticine, did it float or did it sink?
It sinked did n't it, right to the bottom, so that needs to go in there, so make some plasticine in there.
Right, let's make plasticine.
You have a look for something that floats.
You make out the labels on the side there.
There you go Michael.
Put that right here.
That's a sponge OK, gon na have to write sponge there.
OK, what else have you got?
Now then Kevin, you've got some brilliant shells here, what have we got here in keeping that, is that the plasticine?
Let me write plasticine so we'll remember.
And what's this one?
This is a shell, this is a shell.
and that's the over there and now what else floats Kevin?
What else floats?
What's on here,.
sponge floats, right draw the sponge in there and then we can write sponge.
How you doing Gavin?
What is it Julie?
Sponge.
Wood.
Put the cork up there so we know, very good, well done, plastic spoon, good boy, right, what have we got here?
What's in the one, what's it?
Right, can you see if you can write plasticine there for me.
That's OK, look I'll help you with plasticine, you did very well there, have to pick the spoon, is this the sponge?
Right, let's put sponge in there, now what else have we got, oh were leaving it there, never mind, what else can go in there?
What about the wood?
Let's put the wood in here.
No float.
You've got the sponge lovely, now what else do you need?
Good girl think of something else that's to go in this side.
Or, we needed labels actually do n't we, what have we got in there?
What's in there?
What's this bit?
That's the spoon right, there you go look plastic spoon.
Yeah here and then we sha n't get mixed up.
Now what else floats?
Wood, a piece of wood.
Which is the wood, that one there right, look let's see if you can write wood where the, the label for wood about there, let's see if you can write wood for me on there.
Oh you can, I've just got a, a of the water witch, have a go.
If it makes a mess James I'll help you but you try first.
Plasticine that one.
Right let's super, now then what else needs to go in this floating one?
We've got a shell, and we've got a sponge, what else floated Kevin?
That, what's that called?
Cork that is, cork, you feel it see what it's like.
This is the wood here, feel the wood, see it's different is n't it?
This is cork and that, that says shell look, there's sponge, alright?
Draw the wood and see if you can write wood.
In there.
You're brilliant, I knew you could do it, it's wonderful, now then what else do we need to do in there?
We've got wood, sponge, spoon, cork we need now James look.
There's a cork.
Cork, yes, cork floated every thing floated except the plasticine.
and the shell.
Er, er that says shell that one, that says plasticine, what do you want it for then?
Martin, Mark would like the plasticine.
Can we put these over here otherwise they're going to get rather.
That's fine, you're doing fine lovely, now what else are you going to do with that?
Doing the cork, oh there it is, look there, what else do we need to do?
You've done a sponge, you've done the spoon, you've done the shell, have you done the, oh you've done the shell in the middle, was that the right shell?
Then we'll know it's the shell under there, can you?
Have a go cos you're doing brilliantly, just write it there,.
oh no you're so good at it these days, lovely, well done.
That's beautiful, let's have a look Gavin.
good boy that's lovely, wood, cork, plasticine, plastic spoon, sponge, I think the cork actually needs to go in this one, so what happens when we put the cork in, can you remember?
It did n't sink darling it floated on the top, so we really need that one in there but I tell you what we'll do, because you've tr, written it so nicely we'll put a little arrow and we'll put there, that means that goes in there, alright, that's smashing now all you need to do now is write your name on it.
write your name at the bottom.
Right, write your name at the bottom Debbie.
That's it, G A V.
I N like this, down and along the top like a bridge.
Oops, lovely, good boy, well done Gavin, do you like to show that.
to Mrs, that one goes in there, that's right.
That one goes to Mrs.

that's lovely James, that's fine, OK, you'd better put plastic spoons on or else you'll make, be in trouble because if you floated a metal spoon, now what would happen to that?
Bottom sinking to the bottom little one.
Hold on where you going with those there?
Busy at the moment.
Er why you pushing, hey, do you mind we're busy here and you'll.
I do n't know Mrs.
We'll call you if we need you Gemma you go off and do something else and then will talk about.
I, this one's gone a bit strange, look at that, how you doing now, Kevin?
How we doing Kevin?
Shell, plasticine, you know I told you need in there, you need a plastic spoon, that's for wood is n't it?
Let me write wood there.
cork there you need.
good boy, float, brick.
Mm, now you just need your Kevin at the bottom there, so we know it's you, can you write Kevin?
Beautiful.
Hold on let's check you've got everything, plastic spoon you've got, sponge you've got, what else do we need, wood, have you got the wood in?
Have a go with the wood, here's the wood, write Michelle the answer's no, but later on I'm sure there'll be time for you to do it too.
Shell that says darling, shell, shell, that's just right for under there is n't it?
I'll find you the one that says for spoons, cos it does n't say just spoons it says plastic spoons.
Now James can you remember what happened when we did this?
Can you go and explain it to Mrs when she's finished talking to Christopher?
Explain what happened, but just wait until she's finished talking to Christopher cos she'll get fed up with you if you keep.
How we doing now?
Beautiful, have you got everything in there?
I think you, Kevin it's on the floor yours.
have you finished?, you can go and do the next bit now.
whatever the next bit is, why what's happened?
Will it not in, do it sort of down that way.
one, two, you just hold on a minute can you, just wait till Mark's finished, cos it gets a bit confusing cos we get too many people knocking about.
Let's just.
Well done Theresa ooh you've forgot to put the shell on Theresa, Theresa you've forgot the shell where you going to put the shell?
And.
it did both did n't it, it went sinked to the bottom and it floated, but can you write the shell in both?
Did a shell in both?
Thanks James you can potter away now, thank you actually there's a job you could do for me James, if you like to, find all the things and put them over here with the labels stuck to them, can you do that for me?
Find the things, and get the labels to go with them.
that says plasticine so put that next to the plasticine.
Then see if you can work out what those says and put them in the right places.
And you can help right, let's see who you've got, this is floating and sinking.
float, sink and we've had Gavin, and we've had James and we've had Mark and who else was with us?
Bonitta.
Someone else we had, who was the other one?
Kevin, where's Kevin,.
there's Kevin, Victoria yes you can come, can you go and get these other people as well?
Can you go and get Leisha as well and Sarah OK, Leisha and Sarah OK James can you just go away a minute, away you go.
Now then somebody's messed up this look it says sink here, never mind, can you see it here it says sink, it's a bit wet, this one says float, good boy Mark well done, put your name on the bottom and then we'll be happy.
You've got hold on this is something Victoria, Lisa, Sarah, there was somebody else.

Is she busy, you busy are you love?
Right we'll have you then Jemima.
that's Jemima,.
Sarah.
er Victoria, put that down please Sarah for a moment because I want to explain to you what we've got to do, are you listening Victoria?
What we're gon na do is we're gon na try and see which things sink, what does that mean?
Hold on, listen, listen the question, what does it mean to sink?
Listen, listen, listen, listen Victoria are you ready, what does it mean to sink?
If you sink in a swimming pool, what will you do?
Yes, you'll go to the bottom do n't you, alright, so if it goes to the bottom it's sinking OK?
What's floating?
What's floating?
Victoria what does it mean to float?
You do in a swimming pool because what happens to you, it makes you keep up the top does n't it?
So if you place it.
if you float you'll stay at the top, some people can float and they do n't need arm bands, they stay at the top and if you sink they go to the bottom, now we've got to look at these things look and we've got to decide whether we think they're gon na float, stay on the top or whether they're going to sink and go to the bottom, now then what's this here?
What's that called, do you know?
No, it's called a cork, cork, you feel it Victoria and tell me what do you think, you think that's gon na sink or do you think it's gon na float?
You'll think it'll sink.
you think it's gon na sink or float love?
You think float, what do you think it's gon na do Lisa?
Float, why do you think it will float?
You think it's light so it can float.
You'll think it'll sink do n't you, why do you think it'll sink?
Because it's only little, OK pop it in and we'll see what happens, oh, what's it doing?
It's floating poke it down and see if it'll reach, it'll go to the bottom, that's it it's on the bottom, oh no it jumped up, it's a definite floater that one.
A, definitely float.
It does n't want to go down, jumped it up again, leave her Victoria.
Now then Victoria what else floats?
Hold on, which one says float?
That says sink, sink, that says float, looking again huh, float.
Look at the sink.
Now then, what have you got there?
What's it doing?

Took it out put it on the piano while I was busy playing.
Like when you go round National Trust Homes do n't you, they're all a.
You did n't get me any song books did you?
I was just thinking of two minutes ago like last week.
all two minutes I thought, oh she's brought song books home, she's keen and enthusiastic with.
that, because it would of been a lot of effort on part.
, no it's alright.
Probably a bit of a strain.
Yeah, you can volunteer if you like.
also there's a.
it wo n't be.
Nothing.
Do what Mary?
Oh, well they're not going tomorrow.
It's tricky to have to get here.
Oh dear.
Maybe.
Why not?
Ah, there you are.
We've got one at work that looks like a tree.
together?
Yeah,.
You wo n't do it like that, you'll have to sort of.
I suppose a handle of.
Well now, that'll do us.
Yeah.
yeah, yeah.
yeah.
Is there anybody we know that's any good at tuitioning?
No, I meant just sort of somebody we know.
like if you were dyslexic I could help you.
Yeah you've got to know what you're doing.
yeah.
That's why you need somebody you can ring up and say look, we did this yesterday what am I doing wrong today?
Keep it up.
some sort of.
but again if, if somebody who knows about the G C S E actual course.
Someone must teach it somewhere.
Who?
well.
No I remember.
I just need something that reminds you of what you've done rather than, er.
Well, you'll pass.
Yeah, but I mean you only.
all the.
and what not.
Can you get up to five, fives?
Yeah, but can you get up to that, like get all your other tables?
Right, you know the twos, threes and fours and fives tables?
Oh dear.
sixes onwards I'll show you how dyslexic to do it with their hands.
You do n't need.
The number you have put them together in different places and as usual I got the numbers that fell of the.
could n't sort out, so those things, bit confusing so.
complicated when you start it out, but if you ca n't remember for the life of you then, it's quite.
I know.
And are there things like that then, tables?
Or is it more complicated?
Yeah I was gon na say.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would hate to do that orally I could only do that with.
I think.
Should of had the answer.
Why is the project work so.
That can go next.
They're nice.
these two, really nice, I like this one.
exactly that's what I was thinking.
you could come on our weekend if you're not going.
if you're not going to.
cos they're going all weekend.
He said, he was hoping to go and work there, so.
For a year and that's all I need.
this is what he would liked to do.
Oh I think we will, well it's.
been before he said, yeah, and come back.
Anyway, unfortunately he was gon na go in.
October which is a pity really cos that was when our weekend.
ooh quite keen.
quite keen, well it is n't as if I'm gon na stay for a year, he's sort of thinking sort of you know going out there to work and I.

Well ask him, he can only say.
No I'm not.
Are you comfortable there?
Lucky girl, what about your toes?
Well it would look such a.
obvious.
this thick.
Oh do you want bits and pieces back?
Are we.
how embarrassing, what will that be?
I do n't think I've ever had that amount in it.
cos really, we did n't really go into cost relations.
did we really?
Can you imagine them sending the whole lot?
Mind you, we've got some quite, quite music and things and.
or just have a, you know, start us off because it begin with something, that is.

He's, he's so cute.
and quiet and,.
I think he's lovely.
Right it's me and you know, where are we going on our travels, here we go.
want a lift?
Oh.

No this one here, else my hands will drop off.
Is that what you're gon na do garden?

I'd like to go and do mine, but we're going to do mums and toddlers, oh, cos I was gon na do it yesterday.
but it tipped with rain, oh well happy gardening, bye, oh no you do n't oh dear what she doing to you eh?
And look at the way he's slept on it oh I'm not running Tim, I ca n't cope this morning, I know sometimes we do, but I need to walk to the gate like a lady.
oh you can have a run if you want to.
No I hope it stays like this, is it gon na stay like this all day or is it only the morning?
thanks.
I do n't want to be stuck inside at mothers and toddlers all morning if it.
come home and it rained, perhaps we could all.
this afternoon if it was gon na rain.
Yeah, I do n't suppose everybody will be too pleased about that.
Come on Tim.
do n't you want to walk on the edge?
Ooh do n't fall off.
I know it's lovely is n't it, I.
it is, yeah.
bet it snows trees at the front of our.
pink and are really lovely for a bit and then you suddenly get a wind.
Mind you they must go somewhere I do n't know where, cos we never pick them up.
No I'm sure it's good for the ground.
Oh I know, well we have to do some because if we did n't we'd be under thick feet.
but we only just do it.
we go.
up probably to these oaks here.
we're alright till the oaks drop into the garden.
and then we've had it cos we're well literally up here really.
yeah.
I think they've filled it in yeah and they did it quite smooth, pity they did n't do this one as well while they were I did n't quite understand it.
yeah I did n't quite understand the point of that.
did you?
Dig a hole and.
and fill it in.
bye.
Let's open the garage.
yes, whoops I'll just go inside and get the keys Tim, it's still in the house.
I think you're right, it does, it's filthy this car.
Mm.
Yes, it's called.
we could manage to do that one day, if it's fine this afternoon we might do something like that this afternoon, but if it rains it wo n't be any use, I also want to do the garden this afternoon.
I do n't think we should go swimming do you, because of your cold.
I do n't think we should have a swimming day.
No, I wait for you to put it down oh dear, dear, dear, you alright now?
I'm sorry mummy had to rush us so much this morning it's just when we're in a rush we have to get to school on time you see, it's a bit rotten when you're only three is n't it?
Oh.
Yeah.
mm, mm.
mm, mm.
Do n't bother.
I'll just go once.
yeah.
Who are they? anybody I know?
Hello you're quick.
In fact.
can rewind it, in fact it has to.
be switched off and then rewound and then go in a.
Oh yeah.
Nice sort of man who understood that people do n't know anything about it.
Yeah.
We went out to lunch to er Tesco's we got to pick Christopher up from school and we went just for lunch time, that was quite nice.
cos Andy was having a lunch anyway at work and er.
Lost, lost the hat.
oh it'll turn up.
You ca n't find it anywhere, you think it's probably in that, that, oh look,.
these have done well have n't they?
These things have done well at toddlers these.
Alex just knows how to get, how to get round everyone, to get round his mother anyway.
If his, his mum was n't there he'd just hold on to her and that would be it would n't it?
But I mean he ca n't do that when she's there.
He goes to a nursery somewhere though does n't he?
I've watch a play with.
she does n't talk to him she talks about him to everybody else, either way she.
amazing, bless his cotton socks.
Very, very practical that's what I find of her, she'll say oh and I'm hoping to.
oh that's really lovely.
Why do you bother paying and we were just mucking about you know, like I know something.
Remember what size the lady said your feet were?
She said size ten did n't she?
Which was a jump from eight and a half.
No not ten.
size ten, you're like you're size thirteen.
you're shoe was size twelve and a half but we have to buy thirteens for trainers.
Mm.
Mm is Larry coming here tonight or are you going there?
I rang John see if he could go same time or I could go there.
Well done.
Ask daddy to.
you start that then.
That.
Do you like crisps do you?
Right.
What?
Is that OK?
How do you like.
Yeah, mister crusty's really nice in it?
do n't you daddy?
I thought it was quite good, somebody.
and bath, and bath the children and got their tea ready, what, pretty efficient really.
as mothers go and I did the garden.
It was yeah, Jamie's mummy said it was going to rain this afternoon did n't she?
it's daddy actually.
They let off a little despondent these mums and toddlers thinking oh the best bit of the day, and they forget, it was n't.
And it was a very nice mums and toddlers, hardly anybody turned up too.
I do n't know, last week we were absolutely packed out and then this week.
Well either ill or else they've gone you know cos it's a nice day out do n't know.
All I know is.
There are quite a few chickenpox cases.
Try it again Tim daddy did n't quite understand, say it again.
No, no, he's talking about a story.
Mm, mm.
Yep.
Mums and toddlers thought it was wonderful, we only had half a dozen you see in there cos it was low numbers all round so we had low numbers in the.
as well, had a little do with a little boy called Shane, he decided he wanted to come into the story with a, in his blue car, I explained that on the day of the choose he could either come in and have a story or he was to play with the blue car outside, well he had a fit, he's rattling the door, anyway, I did n't realize there was this childminder that he had with him not er his mum, cos she came and had her sort of say and things.
we finished the story and we got onto the rhymes I presume and a little body sidled in through the win through the door and he sort of sat there looking pathetic you know, I said would you like to come and sit on my knee?
No he said, and I went over and I picked him up anyway, and sat him on, I sat him on my knee and I said we'll just do some rhymes and I could feel him sort of going mm, mm, mm, like they do all pathetic and whiny, anyway Phyllis arrived and afterwards it was, by then he had calmed down and he was fine and I said wan na read the story now cos he missed it of course when he decided he could n't do without his car, so I said next week perhaps come without your car, I think I'd won him over by the end but, it was a bit hairy.
Especially as the childminder had n't seen what had happened, so she did n't realize why he was carrying on like he was, made the whole thing a little bit tricky, can I give you this?
It has n't.

Rosemary came up and said she really enjoyed last night, so, that's something.
I'm not sure it was that brilliant but ha, ha, and it's to change that law.
Yeah he did.
Tim ate an eye before, oh yeah all the people last night had them.
just a tiny one that little boy and the girl.
It sounds like a lot, but it was n't really.
Did you?
sore throat.
When we go to the dentist.
Probably wo n't matter cos.
stand clear.
Presumably it would, I mean, it's.
Yes, I'll go and get it, have you finished there Christopher?
What's he done?
Hello Christopher.
You would n't be having ice cream.
Are n't you having a bun of mummy's now?
I'll just do.
but.
Daddy.
Oh dear, careful.
Oh dear.
Huh, she went home yesterday did n't she?
She's not coping is she really?
Is she just ill now or is she just.
but life generally is helping Well that's nice.
What do you mean what's going to be left over?
, no dear.
Mm, I did double exercises in the garden today.
I moved the bush, can you see it?
Remember your dad putting in a big huge something or other which we never did find out what it was, and it's an ugly little specimen.
Oh no, no, you're thinking of something else, that was that other pathetic little shrub.
that never did anything, that we inherited, and when we moved all that stuff that was on there, all that junk, erm, when we first moved, I thought it might flourish when it sorted it, but it's kind of spindly so, that's gone, no, no, another bush, over this side.
same time as you planted the erm, erm, what do you call it with the butterflies all go on?
Buddleia, same time as you planted the Buddleia, you planted this other thing, we do n't quite know what it is against the fence, and it kept sticking out when we played ball, do you remember?
It was too big for the border, I really wanted little flowers and prettiness down there really instead.
of a little bush.
and I moved it.
and I moved it over to that corner there, where nothing else grows.
see what it can do in that corner.
It probably will die a death, you could hardly ever.
see what happens.
Yes Timothy.
mm.
right.
oh right the forsythia has actually flowered this year.
Remember it used to be three inches long and now a foot long, with a flapper.
I never.
the horse one.
oh good.
eggs,.
sorry.
Oh yeah.
No, it is n't, it's watch is n't it?
Oh is it Play Bus?
Yeah, I do n't know.
Mm.
It was done by the Play Bus man, that's what you're thinking.
There daddy and that's the lot.
What Christopher, has n't watched anything.
Should think Tim's watched more than his fair share really today, cos erm, he's so ill this afternoon, whatever it was, but that Christopher was.
No, he came out for about ten minutes then he said I'm going back in the house mummy, just then flopped on the chair.
Have you?
Do n't you think you ought to eat the pie dish as well?
Stiff teeth.
Mm.
mm.
No did you enjoy that dear?
I've no idea.
Christopher's got homework to do.
Yes, yes.
Tim, keep going.
As of were all a.
what do you want today?
A day we went up a mountain.
Awaiting in amazement.
that's it.
Quiet as a log, no,.
I'll wash up dear while you watch the telly cos I've.
Alright dear I do n't mind.
However, this.
Yes if you can just do that front page which is the easiest one and the second page.
Have you?
Oh well done then that's have a look, where is it?
In that case you've probably finished then.
No you have n't, come on.
Not the whole book.
eight ninety nine do you want to do this and then, have you done this yet?
No, look at page thirteen.
you've got to find out what's the.
there's the same cover.
and you're supposed to put your name.
on that do n't you?
Amazing.
Well we've got one Rosie and Jim video did n't we?
and really I did n't need to do that I ought to.
I do n't know.
Well I've done thing here.
I do n't know where the ring is.
Would you like to go and look for the ring dear?
And while you're upstairs, just have a look on the floor.
highly disgusted.
What were you doing down?
Quite fond on them did n't we?
But not when they're eating, here why did I bother giving you a bath?
Have you found a cloth, Christopher did you find a cloth?
Aaagh.
Ah, daddy what on earth did you let him do that for dear?
Cos you thought he could do it, you were wrong.
I think when it comes to pouring Tim, until you're four.
or five, or six, or seven somebody will do it.
You might as well have been a carpet.
I'm going to probably start washing up,.
will you pass the things through?
So what else have I forgotten to put on then?
This list.
What.
Yeah.
Money, for the dentist?
I can write a cheque.
Erm.
Well I've got a bit, but.
it will be nice, wo n't it really?
to take care of Tim or to say to them that the.
how these things work erm, sorry.
yeah, that'll be nice, cos we do n't really want it do we?
Do have this business chap staying all of Sunday or what do you think?
right.
cos it wo n't be a long evening service will it?
Right, so it does n't matter.
that's probably just as well, so it's on, a couple of hours onto the service really is n't it?
Say you'll be back by half nine ten.
True, we hope.
Have you looked it up then?
Mm, quite exciting is n't it, I mean, well are you excited by it dear, you seem like you're excited?
It is certainly different.
and we can just poddle him along to everything we do, just, I mean it's, you know we can do things in the garden, we can do things round the house we do n't have to lay out anything special do we?
Well I expect.
just because we're special type of thing, it'll be OK cos he will be able to enjoy just being with us or not, as the case may be.
family, yeah and the children I expect that'll be interesting for them, cos I quite imagine he would of meet many English children knocking around really, cos the situation is he went.
as many, and they're lots of fun, but, you know and no doubt aunty will get fascinated by.
and they get.
Yeah.
but, it was a pity he was able to speak on the telephone, so.
Well.
people keep telling me about them and I do n't seem to write them down, I probably.
so I.
Oh yeah.
When.
Mm, sorted out for April the fifteenth this erm Information Technology Course.
Can I keep that writing.
Joe, that's handy.
I can.
David and.
socks, he'll be wearing today and the balls.
in the garden.
I think we'll put some of that away, do you?
going to have Weetabix as well?
in that case you ca n't cope all all that.
So we'll put some of that in there.
There you are.
Sir.
Woops.
Sit on bottom, please.
Do n't.
no.
Pardon?
There is n't any in there yet.
We're waiting for you to sit down properly then we'll start giving you things like milk.
Cos it starts going all over the place.
Come on.
Timothy.
Ooh.
I shall have your guts for garters one day.
Oh, good job I do n't wear glasses is n't it?
Funny expression is n't it, that one?
Please may I have some tea?
Thank you.
So what's on the agenda for you today then dear?
Oh.
Suppose the what, sorry?
And do you know?
No, so you had to sit and work it out.

Mm.
You do n't get.
information.
Oh dear.
Really?
They're probably all at the bottom.
They are probably all at the bottom.
Actually they do tend to be, do n't they?
They tend to be at the top and then there's sort of little bits and pieces go at the bottom.
So perhaps you'd had it.
Perhaps you wo n't get any sultanas now.
Till the end of the Alpen.
I do n't know.
I'm just guessing.
Probably squashed it on the way home from Tesco's.

He works at school.
Daddy told, said when your sandwiches are at work.
He meant at school.
But then he said you do work at school so it's alright.

They did n't need to take two and a half hours over it.
Would everybody stop shrieking.
Hands off the jug please.
What's the problem?
There's some for you.
And some for you.
And nobody ask for any more till toast.
Go away pussy.
It's amazing how a huge c a huge cat like that can get underneath I've just planted my bulbs.
Please do n't shout at me.
I do n't like it.
Well, I do n't mind him walking across that bit but.
Who, Tim?
Well that's alright.
We do n't mind that.
What did you try to say?
Yes.
Did you?
Oh.

Right.
We're not, not very friendly towards cats here are we?
I do n't mind other people's cats in their homes like erm there's a cat at Holly Cottage is n't there?
Is that a nice cat, do you stroke it?
Remember it do you?
It's the ones that come along and just have to do things in the middle of the garden.
Oh that's nice.
Mm.
Cat flap.
Well you can see how cats can squeeze underneath fences.
so I'm sure they can squeeze through cat flaps if they need to.
Is he meant to have half of that?

What's that?
off colour day was n't it?
Whenever it was.
Much better today.
I think it suddenly improved.
I would advise Tarazets if you want to try and get rid of it.
It's definitely worked for me.
Suck Tarazets if.

Mine's on it's way out.
I'm not bothering today cos I think mine is nearly better now.
It can get better by itself now.
Mm.
I've just seen that too Tim.
I do n't know.
Perhaps your arm.
Cos otherwise it would be marmit.
See, marmit I it's marmite.
say please may I have the marmalade.
Oh.
Well say thank you when you get it.
That's it.
Timothy, how did you manage to get on your knees again?
He must have got a spring.
Automatic spring in there.
No he's kneeling up.
Mhm.
When we go to the dentist.
Shall we gather at the dentist.
A chequebook, I'll take.
Did they?
So how much is it now, for children?
It is Ruth's birthday today.
That's very clever.
How do you know that?
No not mine.
Ruth's.
Cousin Ruth.
Remember Ruth?
Went to stay with them and Ruth came to read to you in the morning.
Oh no, Ann came to read to you in the mornings did n't she?
Ruth was n't with us in the mornings.

Oh yes.
And you and me nearly nearly did n't get on the train.
Do you remember the train?
They were all waiting for us.
We had to run quick.
I ca n't remember what we were doing.
Probably weeing up a tree somewhere.
Everybody else was sitting on the train.
We had to run quick to get on it.
Mm.
Did nearly go without us.
We'd have to catch the next one.
Mm.
We are, this is a family trip.
Because said, are the children coming for a check up too.
Cos otherwise it's silly if we go.
and then they go and they never know where they are.
Are the children supposed to go every six months?
Well that's okay.
So it ought to work out twelve and a six month.
so that we go every twelve and they go every six.
But somehow or another it got out of sequence.
Oh chop, sorry.
I'm not listening to you am I?
Are they?
And do what?
Private?
So people like, except the children you mean?
Well how come when we're paying so much?
Do you want.
Oh I see.
Is it dear?
Do you want two?

Why not?
Oh no you ca n't cos it's school.
You can wear them when you get home.
And walk to the dentist.
And walk to the dentist in your new shoes.
Yeah.
Well you do n't take your shoes off at the dentists.
He does n't look at your feet, he only looks at your teeth.
He'll get a shock when he sees your teeth wo n't he?
Four of them have changed since you last came.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yes.
Mummy and daddy and you two.
We're all going, family trip.
Mhm.
Yes and you.
No, four o'clock it is.
It's a little, it's a little ploy to get daddy home early.
Daddy'll have to come home a bit early to have it done.
Yes.
Will you let him?
Yes?
Will you sit on the chair, open your mouth, let him stick a mirror in?
Aah.
I seem to remember last time you got two stickers did n't you, cos you had super clean teeth?
I bet you only get one sticker this time.
I think you were a bit lucky to get two stickers.
I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really.
Was it?
Mm probably.
Mm.
Oh you went to school did n't you?
There was a dentist came to school, remember?
And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment.
Poss no possible treatment.
And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when you bent it back when you fell over my foot.
So we did n't bother going because we were regularly going anyway.
No.
Yeah.
Well I did n't see much point.
Regularly means that we go in anyway t every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they're okay.
So just when some some bod comes to school and opens your mouth and says ooh, this looks interesting, there's not much point because our own dentist knows about it.
No I would n't have thought so.
But some people do n't go to the dentist regularly, so they need to be checked at school.
People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally.
It's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing.
Mm probably.
Probably not.
I'm just guessing.
We've been, yeah.
But not everybody does.
Well not everybody likes dentists and they think that something.
awful's gon na happen to them.
They're wrong.
cos it's nice is n't it, at the dentist?
Well everybody ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy.
But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I do n't want to go there.
But that's silly cos there's nothing to be frightened of is there?
It's nice at the dentist.
Mm.
True.
Mm.
No, you ca n't see that.
That's why you need a mirror.
Can you have what?
What things?
Pink things?
Oh I know what you mean.
For your throat?
Yes you can do, just wipe your hands first.
Well he's got his sore throat here.
Have you?
Right.
You can have one each.
In the kitchen.
I do n't know.
No Tim.
Mummy has to get those.
It says on the bottle, only mummies touch medicines.
Well no, not quite but.
One for you.
One for Tim.
One for you, daddy, would you like one of these.
Yeah.

Very very quick.
Well hold on cos.
Yes.
After the prayer.
be bold.
be strong.
Dad's in the kitchen.
You sound like a monkey.
No-one's listening to a word you're saying Tim.
What's your problem?
You want to sing Jesus?
Dad's gone I'm afraid cos he's gon na be late.
Christopher.
Your clothes are upstairs on the chair.
go and get them on please.
In we go.
In we go.
Shall we close the door?
Er sometimes, it depends.
Granny and.
Some are granny's and some.
Do you remember the teddybear one?
The trouble is he's wearing it out for Christopher so you wo n't see the new one.
I did n't knit this one, but I did knit the teddy one.
Remember the teddy one?
He wears the, mm.
No I do, I do knit.
Not often, but I knit.
Trouble is granny does it and she's got loads of time.
She sits there and does them twice as fast as me.
I th what I like doing, I like the pictures.
So I do n't mind doing the pictures.
If she'd do the sleeves and the back for me I'd be very grateful.
Whereas she ca n't stand doing the pictures cos it takes her too much time.
Yeah.
And then there's all this, yeah green or something at the back.
Ooh.
good gracious!
Good for the good for the soul.
Let's open you up.
Why is it you ca n't do this, eh?
Cos you're on strike when we come to nursery and you like to feel that way.
Look at this owl sitting looking at us.
Sweet is n't it?
Oh well, well he still looks very sweet to those of us who are not familiar with him.
Oh yeah.
Well no but.

They're not though are they, really?
Oh.
Yeah, what are we gon na do today then?
This side or the other side?
Do you want to go and see what's going on in the sitting room?
Or are you going to come in here?
Ooh, hello Bubble.
Where are you gon na be?
Do you want to go this way and have a look?
Shall I give you a kiss and say goodbye?
Oh no you do n't like kisses at the moment do you?
Sometimes he does, just before he goes to bed but you have to put them in just the right place.
Are you going?
They're all in here, the other people.
No?
What are you gon na do?
Sort of.
We do n't quite know what to do with ourselves at the moment.
Oh I'm warm too.
Or are you sickening for something?
Definitely the flu.
Oh well there we are.
Oh dear.
Mm what are we doing dearest?
Everybody's arriving are n't they Tim?
Shall we go in there and help find a jigsaw or something?
Cos you like doing that do n't you?
seems to be our general general start in life.
Ooh this looks nice.
Oh that's a nice one is n't it?
Chains and.
Right, I'll see you later then.
Can I blow you one today or not?
Bye.
Ca n't kiss him.
My other one's kissy so it's alright.
He's huggy this one, not kissy.
He does n't like wet sloppy kisses, he thinks it's silly.
No only one.
You have n't lent it to him have you?
Oh.
Oh.
I would n't like to say what they're doing.
Is one of them a drake then?
Must be.
Which one's which?
Oh they might they're coming for a swim now look.
Ooh just gon na have a drink.
Are you going to pop in there, go for a swim?
Going to have a swim?
Oh yes, there we go.
Lovely are n't they?
Come on then.
Well I think we'd better leave them just to do what they like, cos I expect Gwen wants to get on with her dinner now.
We need to go home.
Going to grandma's house for our lunch now.
Have you had a nice morning at nursery?
Mind that road.
Wait at the gates.
Stop there, wait.
Good boy.
Have you shown grandma your new shoes?
Oh.
Mind, cos there's a car coming Tim.
Played in the sand?
Was that with good James or naughty James?
Ooh.
Was naughty James good?
So there we are.
And they use the whole of the house, you know there's the downstairs, that little room that you saw.
That's known as the nursery room.
Then they go in all the rest of the well just the downstairs.
So they can go, they have a story time in the sitting room, you know with a.
They play on the floor with a.
trucks and everything.
It's friendly is n't it?
You know what I mean?
It's not institutionalized.
Well I think so.
And there's nobody shrieking at them and there's only twelve of them there and you know, nobody's getting cross with anybody.
Well I mean I suppose they do when they do something stupid.
But there's not there's not like.
Yeah.
That's right.
Which is also why I feel that he ought to go to Ironcrest as well.
Because otherwise school will become a little.
horrendous wo n't it?
Specially Woodrow.
Yeah.
But it's sad really because I mean does all sorts of things with them which.
But then Christopher survived did n't he?
And I think it's important.
Mm.
Mm nor do I.
There you are.
Had a phone call from the health visitor this morning.
Shock.
See if Timothy was alright.
To tell me he would, she would come when he was four and a quarter.
It's christmas is n't it?
Oops!
I'm falling out here.
Right, would you like to take those for grandma?
And that's for grandma.
Well there's lots for grandma so we'll have to sort out what's what.
That looks like us that's us, that's us that's us, that's grandma.
Can you go and ask her how many bags she's got?
Tim?
Could you go and ask her how many bags she's got?
How many?
Try.
Four.
Well that's okay then.
There's one.
Can you manage that one, it's a bit heavy?
Okay.
How many bags do you think you had?
So it's not mine, so if we've got it somebody else's.
This thing's still round.
Oh yes.
We've got four what?
I've shut it up anyway.
I do n't think I've locked it actually.
I do n't.
could come Monday.
She could come Monday.
Otherwise I wo n't see her will I?
Oh right!
I'd forgotten about that.
And meet you at our house?
Yeah.
What time is she coming, is she arriving?
Oh.
Well that could get confusing.
We'll have to see whether we go swimming.
I should think we will cos.
very lively.
Right.
Yes.
Oh.
What's the choice?
What are you doing Tim?
Are you full of energy?
He's normally wiped out after nursery.
Mummy was last collecting you was n't she?
Two with corned beef.
You ca n't think out which one.
I think you need to go to the toilet first before we have lunch.
Let's go.
Erm.
You like cream cheese.
Yes please.
What what what?
Tomato.
Would I like a tomato.
And I said yes please.
Would you like a tomato?
Well that's alright then.
Right-y-ho.
Do you want to sit in your place?
Oh.
Why, are they in a special bag?
Bag on their own?
Were they er l loose or were they in a packet?
I did worry about that cos I do n't think.
Yeah.
Tomatoes knocking about.
Oy.
had my children have you? my children?
I know.
And me.
It's horrid.
Pardon?
Well do n't start until grandma comes.
We're just waiting for you grandma.
It's polite.
Well let's wait until grandma's sat down cos she ca n't think straight otherwise.
Are you coming to sit down for this meal?
No I'm sweltered thank you.
Is it?
His throat's hurting.
We've had a family sore throat.
Ooh cream please.
You can say thank you now.
Seems a long long time since we used to do it.
Cos we used to do this every week did n't we?
Come to you for lunch.
Itinerary.
Mm.
If Matthew's not going to come on a Wednesday.
we could come on a Wednesday sometimes, could n't we?
Mm.
On the other hand they come to you on a Monday or a Tuesday.
do n't they?
Mm.
Mm.
Well we shall have to stick to the occasional I bought some of that cheese.
You know, did you see me tasting some?
It was called real cheese turned into a spread.
So it's not cream cheese in a spread.
Mm.
I do n't know what they've done to it to make it spread, but still.

Thought I might as well try it out.
you'll find out.
Do you want a drink Tim?
Mhm.
Desert island discs.
And it's that.
It was erm the Welsh whatsit party was n't it?
And me.
I enjoy listening to that while I'm.
pottering about tidying up.
They think, they seem to think that we want to think about the election all the time.
No.
I'm quite happy to listen to some things about the election cos in fact I do n't know.
And they also just tell it the flavour they fancy do n't they?
That's what gets me.
Meanwhile you know, the rest of the world.
Yeah.
And we do n't know what's going on in it do we?
I suppose if I got a newspaper it would help.
Page twenty four.
before you get any news.
Mm.
Oh well, that's a do is n't it?
Have a look before you bite it.
Oh good.
In that case I'll have this corned beef one if that's alright.
There's speculation about the other two is n't there?
Charles and Diana.
Well you do n't mind them having their ups and downs provided they.
to the ups.
They do n't seem to want to try.
Who?
Yeah.
They seem to have got it together a bit more.
Yeah?
Good.
No yes.
Oh has she?
Is she teaching?
She got married did n't she?
Mm.
I ca n't even remember her surname.
I ca n't even remember her erm maiden name.
Mm.
A nice, nice family.
And the chap, he was nice.
Mm she was a case.
With the party?
Has she?
I do n't know.

She was friendly with er Cath was n't she?
Are the still in Hartsett Close then?
Oh.
What's it like up there now?
Mm?

Have they put nice families in?
So it's on the up?

Mm.
Oh.
So the house is now an old people's home?
I know.
But they've called it the house?
For somebody.
I do n't know.
Do you want some?
No.
I do n't think I want it thank you.
Perhaps grandma'll have it.
Have it for another day.
Well.
You think it's bananas?
He thinks it's bananas.
Oh.
What if I want a banana?
Oh.
I do n't want a green banana thank you.
Why did n't you make me a lamb this morning?
How did they make them?
They stuck something on?
Cotton wool?
Oh I'd have liked to.
a lamb.
I'd have liked a lamb.
You were too busy doing other things?
Mi mingy thing.
What were you doing all the time then?
What were you doing while everybody else was sticking lambs?
Pink things again?
What pink things?
Oh, they're at home.
Oh my goodness.
What, which two things are you gon na have?
You want a banana and a biscuit?
Okay.
I'll just have one thing.
I'll just have a yogurt.
Oh, whatever it is, a mousse.
Oh, sorry.
Oh yes please.
I have n't got a spoon to eat this with.
I think I'm going to have to eat it with my fingers.
Well not here you have n't.
We do n't eat it with knives do we?
I hope this banana's okay.
It's a bit grey.
How long have you had these bananas?
They look a bit grey.
They're alright inside are they?
You never know with bananas do you, what they're going to be like inside?
Only two what?
I'm only having one thank you.
Mm.
Erm I do n't mind really.
What are you having?
Well I'll have a tea.
That'll be nice.
Oh alright then.
Mm.
Cover!
I've got those photographs back by the way.
So you can have one.
Well they're just like the first one.
Yeah.
I ordered twenty five.
The woman was horrified was n't she?
Could n't believe it.
Eat it, I should think.
Yes.
Mm.
It's alright, I'm just seeing if there was any tea in it.
Cos that would have been a bit quick really would n't it?
Oh that was very nice.
Thank you.
I could do with a nice sleep now.
I do n't think I am either.
You what?
He never does normally but he might do it today.
Given the opportunity.
Mm.
I've got to go to the post office actually.
Oh.

Mm.
The main one shuts?
Oh.
Can you not hold it?
Fast.
tight.
Erm what was I going to say?
No.
it's gone.
Yes, I've got to post a card for Ruth.
Er not a card a present for Ruth.
sent a card yesterday.
And then I've got some letters to post that I've written and hopefully will write in the next hour or so.
Well I thought if I have a walk over there at two then by the time I get back it'll be time to go and get Christopher wo n't it?
From school.
And then we're going to the dentist at four.
Mm.
You have have n't you?
Banana.
It's like your marmalade in the morning is n't it?
What do you call that?
Lama oh you can say marmalade!
Yes.
He always.
he always calls it lamade or something in the morning, do n't you?
Mm.
That's the right one, marmalade.
Banana.
Can you do that one?
That's it.
He did it.
There you go banana.
You nearly said it.
Banana.
Ba nana.
Oh are you?
A different bana?
An orange banana?
Dear me.
Do you?
Mm.
Yeah?
Oh.
We had it a couple of weeks ago by accident.
And Christopher really enjoyed it.
because it was when he was ill.
I thought I'd tape it.
Can play with, yeah.
Think it was on channel four.
Would you like to go to grandma and ask her for a cloth?
You're back.
It is a grubby face.
No, not yet.
Er, I can see on the top there but there's lots there and there.
No.
There's a piece there but I ca n't see.
Well you'll have to scrub it hard.
Come here.
Come here.
Have a look now.
Yes that's okay now.
Now you need to go round your nose because that's a real mess there.
Well not quite.
There's a big crack here I think.
cracks.
There, that's better.
There, it's just round your mouth now.
Beautiful.
Oh look at this handsome boy.
What about that hand?
Good.
Right.
Let's take it back out shall we?
It's a bit wet is n't it?
Well well if you switch the telly you wo n't find.
You can have Sesame Street in five minutes if you.
Well there is n't a different one darling.
Cos there's no video.
Why do n't you get some toys to play with?
What at?
Something.
What sort of something?
Bricks?
Oh.
What about washing up?
Oh no she does n't.
Poor grandma.
She gives us our lunch and we have to wash up for her then.
Oh yes we do.
You help us take the things out to the kitchen.
Well I thought if I washed up then I'd have my drink after.
Okay.
Let's just go and.
Yeah, just let the water get hot first.
Is it?

Mhm.
Yes.
It's nice and hot now.
Gently does it.
Yeah.
It's very hot.
What are you planning on doing with Mrs then?
Oh yeah.
That was on Tuesday?
Seems hardly worth it does it?
Does she eat anything?
Well I mean.
I think it's fish pie on the agenda on Monday.
Just leave those there Tim.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Not in here.
Just wipe it.
You've got to wipe it.
get soaked.
Look.
Do you need a cloth for the table Tim?
Right.
Oh, you can put number four on.
How convenient.
Shall I throw this out?
Do you save that or.
I do n't think we need it too loud, do we grandma, when it comes up.
I know it does n't at the moment but you know what I mean.
Well I know that but gets a bit er.
Did he?
What sort of hat?
Oh.
I did n't even know he'd left a.
Eleven.
Right.
next then?
Orange again.
Do you have some of these at nursery?
Thread and beads?
Do you have something a bit like it?
Cos I remember seeing somebody threading some beads once.
In a few minutes Tim we're going to walk to the post office.
You'd think they would have would n't you?
Cos you'd think there'd be a lot of local people who.
Mm.
You'd think more so than a big Tesco's because you would n't think lots of people.
Oh.
Whoops.
Oh dear.
Suppose they think they're being a value or something cos they're cheaper.
Well you get fed up with it do n't you really?
The same old thing.
How many have we got on here now Tim?
It's quite a lot is n't it?
Fourteen fifteen, yeah?
Fourteen fifteen and here's number sixteen.
There.
Number sixteen now.
Fifteen sixteen.
You keep missing out number fifteen.
It goes fourteen fifteen.
There's sixteen on there.
After number fourteen comes fifteen.
Yeah it still comes fifteen after fourteen.
Let's put some more on and see what we get next.
What colour?
Whoa I ca n't catch them.
Lemon scented.
Good grief.
Mm.
Mm.
Are they environmentally friendly?
Well it says it is, whether it is or not I do n't know.
That's it.
We've got them all on.
So how many have we got now?
We'll do this, we'll just thread this on.
Wonder how many we've got there.
Thirteen fourteen fifteen.
