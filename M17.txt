She said I do n't know what your there's a missing, so I it said Mr G, so dad said why does it say Mr and er, she said it's a court order she said, court order, she said er that has been in the yard.
no, so he said erm, when I opened it court order, I said well I do n't know what yours is I said but it's nothing to do with this, I said this is about that so when I opened the other one I remember then that when they originally built that court order bit he give me one cheque for sixty two quid and one for sixty nine.
and the two court orders, they, they'd had one court one cheque and one for the other.
so they both about the same thing, he's been sitting there worried all day, he's.
yeah, so happy today, so.
He's been sitting there stewing all day over that.
Well one was sent to Mr G.
and the other one said Mr.

God knows and erm.
yeah, Cliff was saying that er, he said all yeah, he said he's er he goes through the if, if you're not sort of paying attention to him you.
Well if you sort of leave him out of a conversation, he goes a bit funny, he storms off, I think I had noticed a couple of times that he has, and you see what happens is he sits there.
well he sits there talking at dinner times well then when she goes.
when she goes he's erm.
alright, alright.
she goes.
so he sits there erm, and you know you involve in our conversation, but he sits there talking to her and then he sort of feels out of it and then he storms off.

No, he's got a face and a black sort of leather strap.

when they today she's, you could see she was miles away, so I said, well I do n't know what I said to Ivan, I said something to her about sort of did you.
so I said miles away,.
Oh she said I'm ever so sorry I was miles away, I said yeah we've just said that, I said you never even heard us, so I said what you, you ca n't understand why you pay too much tax, she said no I know why I pay too much tax she said but more she said I used to be in business she said and I'm on basic rate of tax, so I said yeah I've had some of that, so she said what basic rate of tax, I said yeah where I've come so, it's a funny thing she said, I was saying to Carol the other day, she said erm, she said what a difference them blokes you work with, so I said yeah, I said I'm always saying that about these so she said oh she said er.
they they they ca n't wait to get into said it's like a sort of release valve.
well I do n't know, I suppose they sort of well, they the same time paint work and they go thundering down the corridor and go charging in there and, oh back at training on there you know come on, come on we've only got half an hour.

Yeah, in hospital.
The oldest one has.

Well yeah sort of erm.
yeah, a decision that we all erm just think what we generally use through the day.
So.
the one thing I thought we ai n't got, but,.
I said.
Erm, appar apparently oh Percy.
He's sold that big and he's got this now, a Cavalier, what they say they want to do.
the oldest, amazing that he was on the insurance, it had gone up, and the eighty seven per cent.
well all insurances have this year because they said the joy riding kids are flying around.
, no, they.
What car?
What girl?
What car?
Oh I.
Yeah.
Well the reason they caught him was cos they've got just flashed him through the computers as and find out what anyway, put it down they then turn round say oh well, you know whatever they're.
Susan was she?
She ai n't got.
It seems like she's well that's fair enough, cos that's customer's she was paying about thirty five pound every time and they go through, she perhaps think twice about doing it, she said oh well you know I've got that's the end of it so,.
that's fair enough I said a thing.
Well they wrote to the Chief Constable.
oh.
No.
What's the time,.
I'm.

Pardon?
A roof?
I, I was there.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
yeah.
Yeah?
What'll happen then.
Yeah.

I said how much did you say it was?
When you said that I thought.
What er who's in charge of a cup of coffee in there?
Mm I know.
Yeah.
Did it?
I got a bloody letter.
Sixteen hundred and fifty.
Dunno.
Sixteen hundred and fifty quid.
Bloody.
Oh no I do n't I mean I do n't say.
Yeah but what they're saying is it's got ta be in the night before so that when they come in that next morning.
No, what they mean is they if it's put in on a Thursday so it's there so when they, whatever they get in on a Friday they can pay out then but if it's paid in on a Friday then.
they wo n't pay out on on a Friday.
So.
You got.
So they did n't pay sixteen fifty and that's costing us thirty five quid.
They really.
They're all the same though.
No different.
Barclays, they changed from Barclays to Lloyds and they just.
Well no, the building society wo n't run a business like that,.
Soon as they what you're doing they you down.
No I did n't.
No, it's not.
Yeah.
What?
That's right.
He's so afraid he thought he was missing something look.
That's why he.
thought you send you out why you sent him out.
He thought he was going to miss something.
I'll do it.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
Leave it out.
And these?
And these?
And these and these, and these.
Yeah I got one set.
What?
Yeah?
Oh.
see a pen floating about here somewhere?
How how long does for June?
Oh.
Jonathan.
Get your behind here please.
I'll have my tea then I'll shoot off to.
Oh.
Is that what that is?
I thought you'd caught your tights or something.
Cor.
Mm.
Cor.
Is that a bruise?
On my desk.
if you can just tidy that rubbish.
There's an empty coke tin.
There's an empty.
You must have done.
You must have done.
Well, you had it.
You drunk it.
Yeah, and stuff on there what belongs to you please.
The packet.
And your transformer.
Were n't even a flicker out of it.
Absolutely dead.
Yeah.
Well he was the one who said they're two ninety nine and one ninety nine.
I was saying big I think.
And he said that er he's had a do with erm Joycie.
Sold her.
Well he's sold her a set of patio doors and told them they'd be sort of six to eight weeks delivery.
Meanwhile Mo smashes out the hole in the corner of the house sort of thing where they're gon na go and they ai n't there.
He said and I told you he said six to eight weeks he said.
Why smash the hole in the corner of your house?
Cos she was on the phone crying that er she's got a hole in the side of her house sort of thing.
I assume that's where she means.
Well yeah.
Oh and erm he reckon that he's, he's had a big do with erm.
Brian.
Brian, no yeah Brian.
He said er we had a big hoo hah he said er I borrowed some money off him he said some time ago to do something with and I had n't got the money he said and when I sold the plot of land he said I paid him back what I owed him cos borrow the money.
He said now he's telling everybody he said that er I ai n't ever paid him and I still owe him the money.
So I said no.
No.
Twenty nine thousand he reckons he sold that plot for.
I had to get out of bed.
I was asleep in bed.
I had to get up a.
I felt terrible last night.
I said to June I can hardly see I've got that bad a headache.
So I went to bed and I had to get up and get dressed and go and pick him up.
and I was like this driving along the road.
Terrible.
He said I ca n't pay you till Tuesday cos the money ai n't come through for the work he said.
No.
What he said was you do n't get paid until the erm the actual sort of whatever it is he's sold has been installed.
So if somebody says I'll have a set of double glazing doors or something until they've actually been installed he then gets paid.
No.
But I mean what I could n't understand was if he's selling all this stuff and.
making so much money I ca n't understand why.
he's that destitute that he.
he more or less sort of said well I'll have to have a cheaper car.
Said well I do n't do a cheaper car than that.
And he's specially asked down to Dover to do his karate thing or something.
Well he was saying I do karate.
Well to tell you the truth I did n't really see him cos it was dark when he got in the car.
You went upstairs.
Suppose they're the same family.
No I went, as I say I went to bed.
What?
Oh.
Well I noticed it soon as I got to there.
In the middle of the room.
I noticed it straight away.
Well that ai n't doing anything.
That's the whole point.
Mm.
I'll put a can of that juice in.
Yeah?
Yeah the carcasses, and they was in some of them was just sort of like died there and that was it, it was just there, and it rotted away and there was all.
Two or three carcasses of animals in, in a plastic bag and it said they was just literally matted together.
And the stench was out of this world.
That's what the bloke said.
There was thousands he said, from the R S P C A, was thousands of maggots and there was a little kitten erm guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbit.
No, these was alive and they got all them.
But they just said all over the garden there was just dead carcasses of animals.
And as they just died there it was just left there.
And this woman neighbour, I mean she looked very respectable.
Well it was something to do with the little boy.
And they said something about this woman a neighbour said oh where the hell's Jimmy or something today?
So she said oh he's alright.
And then he just never went to school and they maintained they'd got a private.
And so she said, thi this neighbour said well just how nosy can you get?
You know she said I just said to her oh how's Jimmy sort of thing and she said he's alright.
As far as I know she was living on her own with this little old boy.
He had been to school originally because that's what she said he, then he did n't go to school and that's why she said you know, how is he and she said.
That's right.
Well that that was the whole thing.
No he, it was a bit peculiar, I could n't quite make nothing and they said something about they kept him away from other children or something.
And the chap sort of the head of social services or local government officer, he said well in the nineteen nineties he said it is still possible, if you want to to keep your children away from school.
You know it's it's as possible as it always has been.
But when when they showed you in the house there was just like old cardboard boxes just sort of thrown in the corner and and just sort of paper carrier bags and polythene bags just sort of slung there.
You've never seen nothing like it.
I mean it looked like the house had been derelict for forty years.
But they was living amongst it.
Never seen nothing like it in me life.
And the stench must have been terrible.
How god knows.
What what from my fingertips do you mean?
Six twelve.
fifteen two feet I should think.
About two feet.
I should think.
Oh, about twenty four, twenty six.
Something like that.
Why?
Ah yeah well they perhaps mean from his wrist then.
Eighteen inches then I should think.
I do n't know.
Yeah, six inches longer.
Yeah.
I should think.
Oh yeah.
Oh dear.
Yeah.
What you done?
Yeah.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?
Too much radiation, yeah.
I suppose you you're gon na have a certain amount.
Should n't you?
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah quite.
I see that Gary Linekar.
his little boy, they're now.
Has it?
No.
He really?
Yeah?
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Central heating That were n't even on when I looked at it.
There you are.
That's why it ai n't coming up.
Twenty.
Three and a half, four.
Depends what er this time of year about three and a half and then four in the winter.
Oh yeah well it ai n't, that's a different sort of thing to ours.
That's, that's completely different.
Yeah.
Well theirs do n't switch off does it?
It just carries on.
Different sort of thing.
Yeah.
Mind you, I'd rather be like that.
Cor.
Yeah well I two is just really for heating the water for us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's three of you so, well I do a lot more washing than you do n't I?
Mm.
And Jonathan lets the water out, and then fills it back up again.
When he, when he's in the bath he'll let water out and then.
fills it up again with hot.
Lets some out, fills it up again with hot.
Cos he's a pillock, that's why.
No other word for it.
And I say to him I do n't know whether you realize that costs water costs money to heat that water.
No.
That ai n't serious the one who's got er Led Zeppelin coming to her house.
Well I ca n't see her living on five pound a week can you?
She does at the moment.
Telephone.
Has her money in her pocket.
Well yeah in that way.
Quite.
Do you know a lot of them girls at work pay twenty five and thirty pound a week board?
It's a hundred pound a month innit?
Twenty five pound a week.
So that's two hundred pound a month for two of them.
Yeah?
Two hundred pound a month!
Well that's thirty five pound a week.
That's a hundred and forty pound a.
And the way she talks you'd think she's destitute would n't you?
Course it is.
Too true.
Well yeah.
What a useless fairy he was.
He loves Tesco's.
God!
Well that kid he.
that.
Did he really?
God.
Yeah, he.
Well Ken he actually worked with.
He went to work with Ken and he he lasted three days.
He did n't li.
Well he did n't like working with the meat.
Then he was off sick.
But he was completely er this old boy come down to me so he said that old boy's left.
I said no he is n't I said, he's off sick.
He said I think he's left.
I said I know he has n't left because I say his his wife works with my wife and he's off sick.
He said well he's bloody useless.
Sorry, I meant meant to say his mother, yeah I said his his mother I said.
I did n't say his wife.
Works with my wife.
So he said well he's bloody useless.
He said erm they sent him down there he said and they said go there, I forget his name this.
No I mean this old boy's name.
Mark I think his name is.
Yeah.
So he said they said to him well go with Mark and he'll show you the what to do.
And all he'd got ta do was just put like two different bins, sizes of turkeys, and they just pick them out and there's this thing like a V shaped hook and they just sort of.
hook er I do n't know what part they hook up there but they just hook it straight on this thing.
And that's all they do all day long.
Just pick them up.
and go like that.
But it's if they're tall.
if they're tall it's an easy job.
But if they ai n't tall and you've got ta reach every time, that's bloody hard work.
Well I know that cos they're heavy old turkeys.
And that's cold in there it's a terrible cold.
Well he was doing this old boy was doing nine to his one.
So I said well how could you do nine to his one?
He said well he used to go and he'd sort of look up at it, and he'd sort of think about how he was gon na put it in there he said then he'd be going like this then he'd sort of get hold of the other hand he said and he'd put it in like that and these other old boys are going like this with full hands you know?
He said he's pathetic.
So I said to his boss, like Ken's boss, Tony I said how are you getting on with your counting?
Cor dear oh dear he said, I know I well know why he's down here doing that.
So I said is he any good at it?
He said I do n't think that boy'd be any good at anything.
So he said I can honestly say he said I think he's one of the worst I've ever had down there.
So Ken said to him I ca n't understand what a boy like you's doing here Duane.
He told Sue did n't he?
So, but I, I think he thought Ken meant that he was like superior and he did n't ought to be doing that sort of job.
You know, he ought to be doing better things.
And Les said he'd be sitting here I'd say Duane ooh ooh should I be working he'd say.
He said he was sort of just miles away, sit there he was you know looking out to space and I'd say Duane ooh should I be working he'd say.
Oh dear.
Just a bill for that I R N B thing, whatever.
I'm gon na get it all back, yeah.
Erm what it is it's er.
Erm so far this year I've paid nearly, not quite twelve hundred quid.
I should get all of it back.
And then I should n't pay tax.
I would think.
I well see, he's put the books in.
Depending how quick they actually okay them erm I mean for two years, three years now they they've just gone straight through with no queries at all.
That might be my luck this year that'll be the bloody year they give me a query.
But if they go straight through, well then that'll go through to the Spalding tax office.
Then that'll go through to Turners so I mean it could be like a fortnight after they've been okayed.
Yeah.
But then if it goes on.
Well I can ring him Monday ca n't I?
Yeah.
Yeah you see what I want to do the arrears that I've got with him.
and and the erm the bank loan the mortgage would then pay the mortgage I've got.
The new mortgage would pay most of what I am in arrears with him you see so, which would keep him happy.
With the finance bloke.
The one who want the money last week.
Thirty at the end of the day I want a mortgage of about thirty five grand to pay the bank, pay him and also the mortgage that we've already got.
Like that would then pay that off and have another mortgage.
Yeah.
Cos you got what they said was.
She says erm.
Erm at the moment my mortgage is eighty four.
Yeah.
That's that's my own mortgage.
The bank I pay cos there's two or three different things I have to pay to the bank which they insist if you have a development loan you have to have this and you have to have that and that comes.
Yeah it comes to about four hundred and thirty five pound a month.
The the the well the equivalent of the overdraft.
But you see you have an over you have the loan.
But they then insist you take out this insurance so if you're off sick.
that's automatically paid.
No.
No.
No.
No that's what I'm say I'll tell you in a minute when I've finished this.
See what he what I pay at the moment is eighty four pound for the house.
And it's about four hundred and about four hundred and twenty, four hundred and thirty pound to the bank.
So I mean you you're talking five hundred pound are n't you?
Five hundred pound.
Erm but that's not taking into consideration the arrears on the vehicles.
But, the other way if they say yes you can have the mortgage, it works out about three hundred and sixty pound a month.
Then there'll be nothing going to the bank and it also would pay off the arrears on on the vehicles.
So I'm paying like a hundred and twenty pound a month less but it's.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The amount my ordinary bank charges forgetting any sort of bank loan, nothing like that at all, interest, nothing like that, just bank charges for standing orders to the finance company er are something like sixteen seventeen hundred pound a year.
Well that's what I've said.
Pay it once a month.
Well Les was saying the only thing you've got ta be careful of like when you pay money into a bank when you're in business and you pay money into the bank and the bank then pay your standing orders er and everything's done through a bank, then the tax office sort of tend to think well fair enough you know, he's legit.
But he said when you start paying money just into a building society and then lump sum this and lump sum that they tend to sort of then oh you know, what is actually going on here and they tend to start looking about a bit more.
Well then when they start looking about a bit more, that is when it costs you because anything that Les has to get involved in, cos they go back to Les and say well why did he do this and why did you do that?
Then it costs you.
Oh yeah but I mean no I I do n't mean in general, I mean specific things.
They'll say well why did this cheque do so and so and why did this do so and so and like he said well when you're talking about forty eight pound an hour you do n't want me poking round there trying to sort out the tax man.
Oh no but I mean it would n't be.
Oh no no no you ai n't you you ai n't caught what I mean.
Yeah but, no but you think how many yeah but you think how many entries go in my book during the course of a normal year.
So then if suddenly I have about a tenth of them entries.
Exactly.
There ai n't the detail that there has been.
over the years.
And that's what they wan na know.
Yeah.
Oh no, no I do n't, no I do n't mean no I do n't mean I do n't mean the business going here, I mean the things that I pay.
I mean everything I have to detail down down to what payments I make and what costs I have everything is all detailed down is n't it?
Well then if you're just paying that money into a building society and you're paying, obviously you ca n't write out as many cheques as what you would normally d do in a bank and have a standing order so therefore it's got ta be paid by cash.
Well that's that's when the tax man starts getting fishy and you've got to know.
Well it's just that the cash is ah no, that's what I'm saying.
But they, you got ta have I mean I could say oh I paid erm what shall I say erm off the top of my head, what can I think?
What I pay.
Well that's a little bit different again.
No well that's what I'm saying.
Yeah but you see that's if it's cash every time, that's when they start wanting to be fishy about it.
And they then say well right, cos every time an accountant does your books at the front of your, the actual like er the booklet what you get on your accounts it says at the front something like these accounts have erm have been audited but only erm we have taken the word of Mr that what he said is right.
I mean they ai n't sort of I mean what they could force you to do if they really, I mean they would never do that but what they could force you to do or Les to do would be to check with all those people who I've actually sort of made payments to, to make sure that I have.
So I could write out a cheque saying paid Carl sixty pounds for doing my car.
And I could actually give you, I mean I've all I've got is a cheque stub.
There is nothing what actually says, only when that cheque goes back to the bank, there's nothing anywhere apart from the bank who says that cheque is actually made out to.
I could put on that cheque's to.
Well that's what I'm saying.
They Les takes my word for it.
So they in turn take Les's word for it.
But if they wanted to.
they could say right.
Ah no well that's it.
Well that's what they do, but he was saying, about once every fifteen years that's what they do.
They'll wait till something goes a bit funny in your accounts then they'll say right, we want to do this.
Now if you remember, the the first year.
Well no I mean no I mean it's just something they can do.
And they, you know.
Well wh the first year we went in business we had that.
the very first year we was in business.
And Les said I ca n't believe this he said, I he said if you'd have been in business ten years that I could understand but he said to do it your first.
Yeah?
Oh yeah.
Oh!
Oh yeah.
Ca n't?
I think ai n't I got it?
Oh.
Oh well I, I did n't realize you'd had a new one.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh alright mate.
Thankyou.
Money out yeah.
Oh?
Alright mate.
Ca n't I take them both?
I should imagine it's the shiny one but I do n't.
No, think that's it.
Oh I'll take them both anyway cos I think that's yeah I I'll leave ours in the garage.
See you a bit later.
What batteries?
Yeah, what about it?
Yeah?
Well they lasted.
They lasted alright.
Where are they then?
What the middle one you mean?
Oh I know yeah.
Okay.
Righto then.
See you later.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Dunno.
Yeah.
Does a bit.
Ooh ladder June.
Cor blimey, I put up another spell.
I could n't go up there.
Cor she was.
No, she was I could n't reach.
That was bending and twisting all over.
Yeah.
That wo n't stand my weight.
Yeah.
Coo that was creaking and twisting I thought ah.
I ai n't done round the back.
Oh yeah, the garage, yeah.
Yeah.
I've got a yard from I'm going up that side and I'm a yard from the point.
and I ca n't get no higher.
Cos I got the Brian's ladder, like an extended ladder.
but he said you know when you're start extending them any more than it is.
they get a bit they start to whip like that.
And I ai n't no good at ladders at the best of times.
He was saying if you had a three tier extending ladder then the they sort of, their more rigid.
Because you know it gets.
He's he's taller than me is n't he?
He's a big old boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh ca n't you just.
Specially when he sweats.
you mean?
No, what mate?
Do you mean, do you mean.
He's got another one.
And he did n't know about it?
Been doing alright.
Has he?
Yeah?
Well he's got enough of his own anyway by the sound of it.
North oh yeah North and South Pickenham.
Yeah.
Yeah I know it.
That's where Barbara used to live, North Pickenham.
play game.
Tiddy tiddy.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Sounds like it.
What, he knew he had it?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well he's saying that that bloke mistook him for somebody else then?
Is that what.
Well he did n't.
I can assure you I kn he knew exactly who he was.
You see what happened was he nearly knocked his kids over.
He come flying round that bend near mums and nearly his kids were on the side of the road and he come through there.
and he knew who it was see cos he goes up the pub same as he does.
And th obviously there are n't that many American cars around.
And that's why he went to the toilet without.
Yeah?
Oh.
A Alan?
Yeah?

Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh I know what you mean yeah.
Oh.
Yeah?
He said, yeah.
that's right he's still got it the bloke has, yeah.
Was it?
Pity he did n't hit him cos he's a big man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
easily have been.
Oh yeah,.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I said to June yeah.
I said to June that's gon na be a bloody great house opposite us.
me!
When I see it!
Cor and the rest.
I bet the house itself is as big as.
No.
He just says I mean he was saying to June.
Roof tile.
They're looking for one sort of nice house to sort of show them more or less.
It's in the.
the Ideal Homes Exhibition this year.
And they're looking for a nice house to put them on.
They're gon na give them to him.
No.
No, what he was saying was see he sold his house for two hundred and thirty thousand I think he said.
But what he said was that erm the house wanted a lot of money spending on it and he could n't afford to do it.
And the farm has, last three years has lost a lot of money and er they had one farm at Colkirk which they've now sold and er they just sort of decided they wanted to make the, they had a big barn, a big white barn which was a real old barn and he wanted to make that into a house.
And er the planning people said no, we wo n't let you do that but you can knock the barn down.
and build a house on there.
But the stupid thing is it ai n't where the barn was is it?
Further over.
So he's now knocked the barn down and he's erm gon na have this new house built and.
Well that's right.
Yeah.
Mind you I suppose it would have been close to the house.
So that's now give him more garden space sort of thing.
But he said they've just I mean this year the whole orchard.
That.
complete orchard opposite us they never picked one, that's a plum orchard and they ne never picked one single plum.
Cos they, they did n't Jonathan cos he said we ca n't sell them.
Nobody wants them.
And that's why he said you can go and pick as many plums as you like cos we just have n't.
He was saying what happened was the last three years there's been no plums about so the supermarkets have sort of found something else.
Now there is plums they do n't want them.
They use marrow cos it's cheaper.
So that's what they use.
Oh you know that bit of cheese we got from Superkey?
That mum said she cu definitely cut it off.
Cos we thought it was a bit what they had pre-wrapped?
Yeah.
But she said she definitely cut it off while she waited.
On the Friday that was was n't it?
It was mouldy.
Well I thought perhaps it was a bit what was wrapped up.
But mum said no.
Definitely not.
She cut it off.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Got to press record and play.
You did n't.
That's got ta click in, yeah.
I dunno.
It looks like an Old Spice bottle.
A white bottle.

Yeah.
Coconut sort of stuff.
God knows.
Costs twenty pounds more that hostess trolley in here than in Comet.
Cos did n't I say to you it's a hundred and nineteen quid and when I bought yours it was a hundred pound.
Hundred and forty quid in Curry's.

He said bloody ironic is n't it?
Said he said and the bloke got gone bananas he said, he.
call Wendy everything.
Reckon it was a sort of put up job.
So he said I got back on the phone to him and I said as far as I'm concerned you can get in your car and come down here and fetch back what's left.
And you can sort out delivering yourself.
So he said he rung him back six o'clock that night and he'd sort of calmed down a bit.
So he said er I've got ta buy erm Paul a new lock because he's got a big padlock and.
I dunno something else on the garage that.
He said I thought.
Never asked him.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.

And the two days for this year and the two days for the estate car.

Two of them were n't it?
Fifty quid is n't it?
Was it fifty?

That'll bring your colour back.
What was that?
Yeah?
When did she start putting on weight?

That's what made me think, you know?
When she started getting fat.

And the other aerial is just plugged in the back where the aerial goes.
There's a little tiny plug and that works off that aerial okay.
Yeah.
Put that in where the aerial goes.
Yeah.
And then you have to what you'll have to do erm do n't bother to change the telly for the moment.
Just get hold of the aerial and just sort of twist it round and see if you can a good enough picture.
If you ca n't.
well then you'll have to set up again with your controls.
Yeah.
The only time you do n't get a very good p if the atmospherics is a bit haywire.
And if that's a damp night or something.
That goes a bit haywire then.

I stagger upstairs and I ooh ooh ooh.
Sometimes that's too much effort to get my clothes off.
Bloody right too.
I went to bed the other night.
Did June tell you?
I went to bed Friday night and my head was like a cor that was really, all round here that was really sort of hurting.
I said I've got to go to bed.
Went to bed and I'd got to bed and I'd been there I do n't know how long.
And Joey rings up and said I ca n't get down.
Can you deliver that car?
So I had to get out of bed, get dressed and go down bloody Tilney again.
The old git.
Never again.
Yes.
What?
Oh I'll give him a cheque some time this week.
I do n't wan na rush in to him.
He wo n't appreciate it if I do.
Mind you he come down from five hundred to two hundred and fifty so that's helped a bit.
Yeah.
Hopefully I should have another bang middle of the week so I, if I give them both to you then I.
One fifty six.
I've got it.
Took it down there for mum.
Yeah.
I owe her a pound.
Yeah.
Well it's not done.

Yeah.
Oh longer than that.
They were done once at the other house were n't they?
That's right.
That's it.
Fifty quid are n't neither here nor there is it?
Interest on fifty quid a fortune.
Mm.
That's what he wants.
have.
Tetleys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In advance?
In advance?
I've never heard nothing so stupid in my life.
Well how does she to do the books in advance cos she do n't know what patients are gon na turn up.
Well I've never heard nowt like it in my life.
Well I've never heard nothing like it.
She does her books six months in advance.
Not up to date, but she does them six months in advance.
Well that's what I thought.
Nicky could leave next week could n't she?
Yeah.
Bloody right.
I've never heard anything like it.
It's more than two hundred quid is n't it?
Well the old boy works at Beck and Pollitzers you know?
And erm he's hired from me for some time now.
and he said some time ago, he rung up one afternoon.
and he said my boss.
erm wants a minibus like his boy was in some sort of football team and they need a b need a bim need a minibus.
So the bloke come over and hire it.
Quite a nice old boy.
Hired the minibus.
No problems.
Well then he rung up few weeks ago and he said to June, we'll need a car for a week.
One of the whether it's him or whatever but one of the people who work there needed a car for a week.
What not the Belmont?
I thought the boss had the Sierra.
Oh did he?
Oh.
Well he said send the bill in.
Anyway we sent the bill in.
Well anyway.
a fortnight afterwards he rung up and said his boss had sm something had smashed into his car, and he wanted a car.
So he had the Sierra and he said I do n't know whether he'll want it for, it could be sort of three or four weeks if they're gon na repair his car or if we can get one within the company like at another depot obviously they'll get that for him rather than hire one off you.
So he had it couple or three days did n't he?
Erm it would have been three days cos that's ninety odd quid, ninety six quid.
Joey tells me last night he said oh by the way he said you do n't wan na hire your car up er the Berry's.
I said why's that?
Oh he said they've got all sorts of aggro he said.
The father's had his house repossessed for not paying the mortgage.
And he said the boy has been done by Budget for hiring a Sierra from them and taking the engine out.
and putting it in one of his cars.
So I said to June, the only thing what flashed through my mind, not the fact about having the engine out or something like that but what flashed through my mind was whether it was for Beck and Pollitzers at all.
Well you see been hiring from me for ten years.
They live next door to to Joey.
His father used to hire from.
And he said Beck and Pollitzers often hire cars he said and you know he said I thought I'd try and get you the business.
Well then about a month later he said he rung June and said I've been speaking to Geoff he said and th they wan na hi er hire a car for a week.
But this is like now it must be.
Well, it's a good month.
Yeah, must be six weeks now.
Yeah.
Well that's right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm ready.
No.
He do n't say much does he?
We ai n't gone yet.
So that's the third tape is it?

I tell you what I keep saying I'm gon na do but I ai n't.
got the bloody money to do it.
I should like to have a ride down and see that new bridge now.
Instead of going through the Dartford tunnel.
That new bridge is open.
What goes right over high over the Thames.
You go over that and you come back through the tunnel.
That's now open, it opened last month.
Mm.
I'm waiting for someone to use a tankful of petrol so I can go and have a look.

It's just kilograms kilograms innit?
Oh yeah.

Yeah and scaffold.
That's right I mean just do th both bits at the back and front at the same time, yes.
Well yeah.
We're going to.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I suppose that way you should be.
They're not expensive, mind but.
I mean I I really could of a I mean I hired that ladder just to do about six foot either side.
But you got that for your.
After that lo lot.
unless you're taking the chance.
See that ladder you've got, you know the bit you had this morning?
If you have the back half of that that'll be ideal.
I do n't know, it's.
Ken's old one innit?
Cos old Ken used to have to an old ar aluminium one did n't he?
Yeah I borrowed it, I borrowed that one, some time ago.
That's right mate.
Yeah, I'll tell you what I did if I if that's ladder's out, I'd drop it down the back of somewhere.
Cos they've had people round and nicking things ai n't they, out the back?
Oh the nicking out of the er sheds, lawn mo, lawn mowers and things.
Yeah Nick knows who he is or some something like that I would.
Yeah.
Well why they do n't lock it!
Yeah.
No but.
They can, what you should do is just drop the ladder in out, in the inside that's all.
Yeah, they just pull upwards and.
But I mean there's.
Yeah i yeah that's the luck of the draw, you know.
I think that's all it is is n't it?
They'll go somewhere else then.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah course it does.
I dunno mate, someone Nick's house cos I wanted to put a lot of stuff over my shed cos that garage is getting a bit congested.

Yeah.
Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him.
Oh yeah.
Let's face it she erm I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Yeah.

Well yeah well I suppose that's what she thinks, if she gon na go through the rest of her life with a bloke she hates.
Yeah.
Well that's gon na be the farm though innit?
They'll have to sell sell the farm and everything.
And hope.
I know yeah.
Does he though?
I always see him riding about up the Steven there he's always up there I know when I used to work for it was always Steve who used to be riding to this farm, riding to that farm, checking on this, checking on that and taking the wages round that sort of thing.
Oh yeah.
No you do n't.

Oh yeah, why's that then?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can well imagine.
Di oh yeah That makes me laugh!
Well she is n't is she?
That's what I mean they do n't call them they call them cos she do n't want to lose her name does she?
Pathetic innit!
Bloody arrogant can you get!
I know he do n't no.
Yeah.
Oh you said yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's right.
No.
Yeah,.
What?
it ai n't quite the same is it?
Well they just would n't let me.
Well, you do n't wan na worry about them because at the end of the day, I mean if if that was absolutely desperate I shall turn round and say well I'm sorry I've bloody got to and that's it!
You know, but I mean.
Yeah No.
it was they was that panicking cos tomorrow morning, the ministry are coming and.
they was panicking.
We all it is ba, well I say all it is this bloody great strip right be between the ceiling and the walls, the right length of corridor and the manager see it and he said look that should be shiny sort of like and it's all pitted so he said you'll have to go up here he said and do it all with steel abrasive said fair enough.
So of course I, took me about half hour to find the forklift cos somebody had nicked it by time I went got the chemicals Robin comes down, he said oh do n't worry about he said do i do it tomorrow morning he said, they'll be nobody about then can you go down the bot bottom and do the butterflies?
I felt well bloody marvellous, you now, i it was that imperative it had got ta be done, you ca n't have time o no I'm sorry you ca n't!
Well, well no, no because it was then about, that's what I'm is, then four o'clock you see, so I mean I knew I would n't make it anyway that's why I thought I'd better ring cos the job that we finished was half past three so I thought well even if I come home I shall be late even if I do n't get changed and washed or anything.
No that's what I thought I was.
Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's erm he's got a he's got ta go at four actually go at four not an appointment, he's got ta go at four.
Well I do n't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent.
Well it's erm the sort of things they pick them on really is not that.
No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to know what they're talking about but I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's got ta go on a steel pallet and yet next door in the export chiller they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet and we work on wooden pallets erm.
Well if you see how many pallets they got and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
There's loads of things they're on about oh th the there's a whole book what they got ta h have sorted out.
Oh Christ yeah!
Certain doors are not to be opened things like emergency exits there's they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door do n't even open.
So all that stuff.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we have n't got an emergency exit.
Well there's a bloody great roller door, but you see it's at the end we work.
Well exactly!
We have n't got the oh yes there is, oh course there is, that's a lie we go through yeah.
Well that's where they are I went that slid across there like that, phewf!
No..
No it's the London University of.
London University.
It's all about speech patterns.
He sat in his car out there.
and they thought that he was the accomplice sitting outside while somebody was going round the house.
I'm surprised they have n't got.
the bloody postman down as a.
detective or something!
Well well no, you know I had at mum's and I.
come home and I thought well I'll drop that, I'll stay and go up the ladder and I was gon na do painting you got him Hey up!!
So I jumped right away.
!
Then I thought what on earth did he say!
And then I just never understood a word of what he said.
I thought what ever's he on about!
Well.
Yeah.
I was just gon na say yo.
I was just gon na say you got a purple tint in your hair but I can see what it is now!
purple tint on top.
I do n't mind either way really.
I dunno.
Well I think er the funny thing is it's looks dark now.
But I suppose it's been.
Yeah.
Oh I like her hair.
Oh I see yeah.
Yeah?
I do n't think we got one round here.
Peter or Cambridge I suppose.
I remember hairnets.
and.
They're red.
No.
Yeah.
That's right.
Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like it's not on her face anyway is n't it?
So I think.
That'll be nice I ca n't really remember.
No.
You do?
Yeah.
Mm.
It's not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It'll fly by now Christmas.
New Year, Easter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You need n't get the.

Sort of classed as a labourer and.
Then there's twelve of us down.
Social security.
Exactly!
See they'll maintain that.
Social security.
Social security is when you have n't got no money and he has got money.
Yeah.
No.

They were saying on the television the other day.
the new taxes.
The new tax law thing.
if they go up erm the government now wan na.
bring this new tax, but instead of poll tax and community charge and that it's gon na be like a new erm property tax.
And er what they're saying that, sort of, you get people, shall we say, older people who.
are retired so they got no income and then perhaps been left the house.
in in a will or something.
so they have the house and move into house.
but they're gon na taxed so heavily that they ca n't afford to live in it under this new tax!
They've just got ta sell it!
I thought well how what a bloody shame!
Have yeah.
the.
The rates, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have do n't have actual they have n't got money but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property, though it do n't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?
If.
you've got no money we have n't got any money but, you know.
I mean why should I I.
Yeah that's right, I mean some people do n't.
Yeah.
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you do n't get taxed on that.
new car.
I thought it was the front doorbell.
Here we are.
you got the in here?
then.
Better have the one who's died I think.
It was n't her June, was it?
Not her?
Oh well that's.
Yeah?
Oh.
Hey?
No that's him.
that's him on the phone.
he was saying all the sort say at work you know that they they do n't know and they start on about er.
you ruin your chances so about three times a week the comes in to arrange my poll tax and all this and they get going you know well why should a bloke that having a big house and he only pays the same rate as them so I said, well it's like this as far I'm concerned I said you know no bloke works perhaps twice as many hours as you do he chooses.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
The only time you do n't pay a self-employed stamp is if you your business earns, yo you can actually get away it, if you've lost money on your own business on paper or if you've earned.
Yeah tha that's what I'm saying, I ai n't got to.
No.
Ah that's, what they've said once you've paid it, you ca n't get it back, and if you do n't pay it they ca n't insist you pay it.
No I paid the last one though.
No, I ca n't afford to.
Yeah.
Dunno, well that's the situation.
I think you're allowed you're allowed to make thirty pound a week profit fifteen hundred pound a year, anything over fifteen hundred pound on your business they got ta pay tax.

Ken lost.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well but I mean, Brian was saying himself you know he ca n't remember at least he's says he's been working down London when he has n't been earning a hundred pound a day you know, it's something, we just accepted it, he said over the years I've been earning a hundred pound a day he says, and that was it you know yo yo just do.
That's it.
He says he worked like a pansy he said and now he says I go.
and he says and I'm putting in God knows how many hours, he said and we got a drop to fifty pound a day.
I said well exactly I said.
Well no, well I mean like we do I mean I mean but I mean my gross up about three hundred over Tony's but I put in many hours right?
is n't it about like that.
quarter to five in the morning.
till quarter five at night and then Saturdays as well till dinner time you know?
But they.
better that me.
Well that's right that is.
it.
That's it.

Well that's right.
Yeah.
Well Brian was telling me.

Eight o'clo, eight o'clock.
Oh.
Er no I mean, them over there.
oh but they really get up my nose! just wan na do is phone me up, you know I I sa oh had a row with, do n't say anything like about quarter to four time and I said to her, well I'll be quite honest I said er there's sixty pound a week or seventy pound a week I get more than you I said I have never heard a load of moaning pratts in all my life!
I said you overtime you're moaning cos you got ta do, oh yeah we're always.
the one's that have got ta I said and as soon as you ai n't got no overtime ooh we are n't allowed a lot this week, we're a bloody flat week da and a I said I do n't know what to do to keep you happy!
I said if you said to me, Geoff, I want all the overtime I can get I can get the overtime I'll go round and I'll try and or if you say to me well I do n't want the overtime, I'm quite happy with a flat week then I'll know what I am but I said you change from day to day, one day you wannit, another day you do n't!
You.
just want the job, to suit you if you wa, if you want to go and pick your kids up from school you'd think that oh why should we do work today, you know, let somebody else do it!
So I said.
well blow that!
I said there's a.
That's right I said, you know, I ca n't understand you!
I says yo you go out to your flipping eleven pound a week.
and er he gets a thirty five pound a week child allowance on his for his four kids!
That's a about a innit bloody hell!
Paying they're paying.
yeah so.
so I er he said er no he said, it's not that he said I do n't like people to tell me you've got to do overtime today, he said, I like to be asked!
I said well I'll be quite honest mate, there's two hundred people working in this factory and I said, if you think that e all the charge hands and the supervisors have got to come down and roll up you lot to get the job done I said you turn round and you think if you was in business, whatever it is you like to do, if you're in business and you've got an order and that order's got ta be out by six o'clock tonight and you've got ta grovel to your workers otherwise you'd lose that order, I said what would you say?
Down the road mate, I'd get somebody who wants to do the job.
I said and that's exactly how they are!
I said they are n't gon na put up with like you!
I said and that's why cos Paul said to me, he said, I never hear you moan, I said look you wo n't hear me moan because it's not that I enjoy the job I hate the job I said I hate the work, and I find it hard work but at the end of the day on a Friday, I know that six o'clock in the morning on a Friday I can go up to the Nationwide Anglia, slip my card in there and I know there's gon na be a couple of hundred of quid in there with the.
tax paid and everything, and I know it's gon na be in there I said now that to me is worth a lot I ai n't got ta worry whether there's gon na be cheque from out on my doormat in the morning or if it's gon na bounce when I put it in so I sa.
as far as I'm concerned.
whatever o overtime they sling at me, I'll do not because I feel like doing it but I need to do it there's.
my wife and kid at home!
So he said oh oh said his moan and groan so he said well I spoke to Blue he said, he's off sick he said and he gets ninety pounds a week for being at home I've been working here all week he said, for a hundred and forty so I'm forty pound a week better off than him!
Yes but he's sick!
I said he's not on holiday he's sick!
Yeah.
So I said.
Yeah so I said to him.
I said but what an attitude to take!
I said you're not working for forty pound a week.
you're working for a hundred.
and forty pound a week but.
you have to be sick you still get paid.
I said you're going about it with the wrong attitude!
A lot of people say I'm bloody lucky to get paid for being at home sick!
Yep, I said what are you.
I said no I was home sick and I in bed like you said I could n't who's gon na turn round and say well there are Geoff there's a hundred quid mate.
we know you're ill in bed?
I said but you're.
bloody lucky!
I said that'd do you good to be in business for a couple of years, that'd get you sorted out!
Absolutely!
Well like they're.
that's what I said to Ron, I mean I've never known I ca n't remember the last time I when I used to work for Colin for ten years trying to get a holiday out of Colin was like trying to get blood!
Oh you ca n't have two weeks at once you know but over there you got ta get rid of your holidays before December, you got ta get rid of them otherwise you lose them.
Take them, you've got to get rid of them!
In the end I could n't get rid of them, I had two days off when I was ill and I had as holidays to ge to get them sort of settled up you know.
To get.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I should think I should think you it's nice to have the six weeks ahead of us and she said well it's not a holiday!
I thought well I would n't mind.
Ooh no!
No, not going into the shop at least, yeah.
You're back to work.
Yeah.
That's it.
Well why ca n't she do that two weeks marking in that first week she needs to unwind?
And then have a.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
is n't it?
No well I.
That's right.
Yeah.
Ah I dunno.
They all sort of.
and they're all.
ready to ta, that's what I said to him you're always ready to take out hand outs, what ever's there to be handed out, you know.
Cos that really got up, up my back when the, I mean tho ai n't a ba, bad bunch of old boys but I normally go down but they they clear and once we've done our work before dinner break they all clear off and I go down to the and then I sort of walk back more or less behind them you know, to the break like and as I go past the club, I go and wash my hands, they go straight in, I go and wash my hands and I walk past the and er we should go to dinner at quarter to twelve and I go past, it's one minute past quarter to twelve so cos when we go in there you see quarter past twelve due to go back I always give them two or three minutes and I say that's it, that's, ah we was late coming in, I said no you were n't!
We was I said look I can read a bloody clock as well you can, I said I wa walking behind you down the, you went in the canteen and when I went past it was one minute past quarter to!
So I said you know, the one minute past quarter to and there's a sort of quietly you know but then you know, just have to grab at.
they get excitement out of taking two extra minutes.
I think oh my God!
You know, I, it's so petty that!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah cos she used to get me t, and then she rang me up one day when I was and said dad erm dad ca n't bring me round there cos the car's not working, can you come and pick me up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah that's how I.
I!
No.
No.
Mm yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Hand outs every time!
Mm.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why should you and.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I said that to.
you know got he he's quite, he's having it built over here.
No kidding you, his is your dad's bungalow, and it's a house!
that's painting the front in.

It's a concrete slab.
it do n't look any.
at all do they?
It is bloody huge, he's had the fireman round there!
But they have n't a concrete slab!
Cos he said it's gon na be as big as the other house.
The old house.
Yeah, he said I got a thousand pound well I'll ring around, he said I got a thousand o off my, I saved a thousand pounds on my roof he said I thought bloody hell, how much cost costing him!
But he.
They bought out, this company have bought out a new tile and he said they're looking for a sort of nice house to have as a sort of a show house and then he thinks he'll get them for nothing.
Oh.
Two hundred and thirty?
Come from Belgium?
He told me that.
no.
yeah.
I.
I sold him the car did n't I?
That was it.
sold him a couple of cars.
He had it, he got caught by he got er.
there's like a big pallet all surrounded and he got a big pond down the bottom it's erm near Grimston Common.
common and he lived at Grimston and er he got this plot and er what was right next door to it was a sort of real big old li like a French chateau and he wanted a big ge red brick Georgian house, a real big one, sort of sitting at the back of this plot that the owner.
had put down the end.
Anyway he got all his bricks and everything and er he got all his ideas what he wanted and then they turned round and said no, we're not gon na let you build down there.
So he's got all his bricks up virtually I think he said, but I ai n't worried about it cos I'll get rid of them somewhere and I helped him out, I sold this car and, and told him what I was doing and he come I've just the thing for you, just cos was having bricks like your dad's, the sand grain sort of brick, you know.
Ooh he said I've got just the for you, he said, he said.
And I di in the end they the same for them, but.
we would of done it by ourself sorted out.
Put them on a did n't they, then load them load.
them on yeah.
Used be able to sit in the car would be go up the back do n't they?
And I used to load the boot up and bring them and load home like in the boot of my car my Sales Manager said to me the other day, how the hell did you get bright red dust in your boot?
I dunno!
There's all like red brick dust in your boot!
Oh no!
And I had Avenger estate, and I done the same with that and I got away with it for ages and I what you want a do, I know what you wan na do he erm, I mean that's that's really sort of pushing it over the top but he got a great big sheet of polythene, he went down to ready mix and had a load of ready mix in the back of this Avenger estate, brand new he'd only just got it!
And course.
and then on top of that he took the battery off Pat's car and it fell over in the front so all the acid burnt the carpet!
Come back dinner time and they were saying well no you see you ca n't just a borrow a car to go to dinner in, yeah that'll be alright man and I had n't even been in it since Roy bought it back!
Absolutely went spare you know!
Sent memos all round, you know and he called me in the office that day, to say I'm really disappointed in you, I said, what do you mean?
He said well I give you that Avenger estate he said cos I thought you were building your house, that'll be handy for you you know yeah you did and you let me down badly!
So I thought now what do I say, do I drop myself in it or do I say well that was n't, that was Roy, I said well you know I said I must admit I said I I'm sorry so erm then Roy said well that battery he said was me he said I, I borrowed Geoff's car again and look the battery fell over in it so I'm gon na help him er then I sa, a piece of that bloody great went across our French doors and this, there's a went across.
there and I went down to the at and he said we got your lintel in mate, do you want to take it?
So I said yeah I can do so he said bring your van down, so I never said nothing so Bob said, got any like your dad had.
It's for our new one again you see so I rolled the front seat down put my brief case on the front seat so he says, where's your van then mate?
I said it's here!
No, where is it?
I said that is it!
Yo you ca n't put it in that he said, it's brand new!
That'll be alright so cos he slid his my brief case and er I got all the way home, no problem at all, I'd got newspaper under the back, so it did n't scratch the back when I come to come down Mill Road this lorry's go, I mean I got the tail gate up and er I sort of looked in the mirror, I thought oh my goodness my tail gate, I could hear it so and I braked a bit sharp and that slid down and scratched along the dash board!
Trying to get it out, sort of plastic dash went creeeh!
This lintel!
That went right across there but well I suppose.
No.
Certainly not!

ca n't afford that sort of money Jonathan.
I really ca n't.
I think that's the something for you, but dad's struggling I really am struggling!

I said and if when he come in he goes I suppose, they do n't want to stay in do they?
So he said er.
Well yeah but I mean I shall have.
Well I ai n't done it yet, I've only erm.
Well no I'll tell you later June.
Er.
Yes.
Oh we can go up to that Fina garage I should think they have it.
Have a look.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it?
Oy ey yeah.
Oh, a duck.
Where was that from then?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah erm Ernie's quite a nice old boy.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah I know what you mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
one night.
Oh well that's I've seen Jimmy.
In the.
half past eleven just now literally just now and er and he basically he do n't know about what he's on about.
Nope, he do n't know erm what he's saying is.
that blokes that's erm dro been rigging it who he does the things for.
Well, because he said for obvious reasons, he said er I did n't want my name and address mentioned.
Now he's gon na wish we'd tell him so he said erm.
Oh it was genuinely gone quite genuine, he said you now, he had a, that we know about but it had genuine.
Well there are you do n't go near them.
So he said choice because it was his property they contacted him but he said what he's done is though right there is n't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety.
We could we can, ah no no in terms of money he's talking about four or five thousand maximum.
Well.
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim so when back, he's still gon na get the amount that he wants so he said t to Jim something about, he is n't paying the insurance I said you're joking!
He said I've insured it he said but I ai n't paying as well he said!
If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!
So erm they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
No and what's happened is, he's been up the bank and er the thing has.
and the thingo's gobbled up his card as he said, well if it has n't gobbled your card then no problem.
If it has.
we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week so he said well it definitely has.
Yeah so he said well what do erm and he said the woman up there did n't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Well because A T S had gone straight to the bailiff and the courts to freeze his account.
Mm because his account was frozen as soon as he put his card in it took it in!
So he said, can I get a new card?
No.
Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done.
Well no cos I ai n't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card but bank said he put the cheque card in and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he.
could draw it up to a a thousand pounds on that card I mean.
That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I would n't of paid it!
He says I'd better go and check the money so he said erm but what he could n't understand was they wrote to him and said that they have n't paid the cheques but they did n't say anything about freezing his account!
Well dunno.
So he said erm I said to the woman I went to the court this morning so he said when you explain to me he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad tha he said I owed sixty two pound so he said I said to the woman in the court how can I pay this the sixty two pounds when you've frozen my account?
She said, that's your problem!
He said well it is n't cos it's your problem so she said, no I'm sorry, she said, you know it's one of those things!
He said well actually I have got the money because I borrowed it.
Well yeah but he said without this card he ca n't get no money, cos he's used what money he had to pay off the card.
No.
Going to grandma's, but mum was going up to B and Q.
Mm.
doing it.
Oh I see what you mean, yeah.
Yep.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh I used to like making things like that cos he makes things for the London museum.
Mm he did.
No they had a van did n't they?
Yeah well he only used to make miniatures he makes them.
Well.
talking of miniatures my God!
They gave old mate some stick this morning!
Cos at Peterborough Football Club beat beat Liverpool last night.
Got in the first division.
And they went and put a poky little old football club in won this well of course they everybody!
He stuck hi and he get that wound up towards the end I felt sorry for the poor little soul!
E every person went past they go alright Peterborough!
Liverpool.
Mm.
So course.
Peterborough.
One nil.
Mm.
So er he sat there tea break.
and you did n't mean to do it Cliff meant to mess about and make out he's gon na knock his coat over like that.
Yeah, and it went all over the table!
Well he jumped up, cor he went learing into him!
Cliff said, I'll buy you another one, no I do n't want another one!
Do n't wannit, no!
Cor he was in a hell of a mood!
Well no, cos everybody wind him up.
I do n't.
know.
I suppose it is, that's like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But a do n't matter how big they are.
Oh he does!
Terrible!
Well he'd kill them.
Yeah, yeah I mean cos Ivan says to me, he says, he makes me laugh he said, cos he do n't back off does he?
I said no he do n't.
I do n't like it.
No.
No.
Why?
No, no I do n't.
like no.

No I really do n't want to mate, I really do n't want to you enjoy it.
Yeah.
Yeah I sorted out all my ten p ready to go and they were there.
Ooh and that girl who left, what was supposed to go.
come in today.
she come in today.
Come into work I think it's assumed she'd left but she did n't leave, she di she had enough of it so she had a couple of days off come in this morning and er I said to Steven, no idea what the situation was.
He said yo it's terrible in here he said, it really is, he said I've never known such catty in all my life!
Well right old bitches they are!
Yeah.
That's right.
No cos whenever we go in there they're always moaning if Cliff starts singing or something.
Oh they go if he starts singing!
So he dropped a metal pallet on purpose and course, it makes a hell of a row!
Well.
Yeah but he, he is rather loud.
Oh terrible!
Yeah.
I ha I had sort of few, few words with him this morning.
Cliff, Cliff.
Cos of that come in front again.
I never said nothing mm cos.
Yeah when I've had this.
I never said anything then he er I could see he'd gone cos he just stood there for about ten minutes like th and everybody else was working, he just stood there like this for about ten minutes by the rack see him doing nothing I never said nothing he come charging through with a rack and knocked all the pallet over what they just stacked up with fifty boxes on so we had to make that right and he stacked a load of L T M boxes which are temperamental anyway and he had n't pulled the wrap tight so as soon the bloke lift them up with the forklift, they fell all over!
And then I'd I'd had enough and then he started messing about and he started pushing the boxes down through my strapper then, course that messed the strapper up!
So I.
I was doing the lift.
He said what's the matter?
I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you if you want to get drunk and you want to spend money then that's fine but once you step over that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've and I've just said nothing because although you ai n't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but.
there's been disaster tonight ai n't gon na put up with it!
Did n't say anything.
I said you know, I think you've got ta sort yourself out Lee and everybody went sort of quiet but Paul said I've never had a rollocking!
I said well in all fairness Paul, you ai n't actually bloody got, I said I do n't do it for the fun of it I said and I do n't like doing it but I see, he just sort of.
I said well the thing is discipline.
If the transport.
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back Robin is gon na get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck I shall get it in the neck and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think.
I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!
I said but I shall be wrong for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
Of course he has he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night not Monday night but again last night.
And he went to bed half past two.
Before then I should think, quarter to four.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah I said to him Cliff, I think it's tragic mate!
I said that's none of my business, nothing to do with me but I said I should think it's a tragic waste for you and I say, it wastes your money but that's entirely down to you.
He did n't say a word, no.
Mm I mean, you know when he gave up the drink.
he was a different bloke, yeah.
And the trouble is you see they all make laugh of it old Cliff, old Cliff, old Cliff!
Yeah well I said to him, what you do n't realise is Cliff they laugh at you to your face.
at the.
end of the day when you do something wrong they're the first to nip in that office and say what you've done wrong and why you've done it wrong.
But I think I shall have a quiet word with him tomorrow morning when I get to work.
Yeah.
Well, you know I just ca n't sort of let it go on.
As soon he gets his mouth round a Guinness bottle mate, that's it!.
Well it's roughly about five pound and, one pound and I thought he said one pound forty a pint.
Well he got through fifty quid on Saturday and Sunday so that's forty pints innit?
That's twenty pints each day.
No forty pints in two like Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, he got through forty pints or perhaps just under forty pints but that's it.
Well he's always been able to drink like that he's.
Well well I dunno.
But I was the trouble.
is.
yeah I mean, and the trouble is what n annoys me more than anything is the fact that he's good worker I me even when he's drunk, alright he do n't work at full capacity but he does sort of almost as much as what they do and when he's.
sober he can do more than they do I mean i that ai n't the sort bloke you wan na lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them well he gets on your nerves really but at the end of the day I'll you know, I'll put up with it.
Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but and when he's like Cor!
And the other morning disgrace!
The funny thing is, like there's a beer smell is n't there?
But he has got the sort of acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath just like you'd been on spirits all night or whatever, any sort of you know, wine and it's not a beer sort of smell.
But I mean he's I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!
I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?
God he said!
Definitely and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!
Oh it's not that, no it's not.
In his side.

Liver, yeah, exactly.
But you see he's that thick.
you ca n't tell him nothing he would say oh no no no, beer's no problem, beer's no problem no it's not that experience, not that experience, I said well you wan na smell yourself Cliff!
Cor God!
it does.
And your guess is that he said er bought something.
Yeah he's.
No he said er.
Chris Ivan said to me, he said Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday he said last night, I tell you, I said I said no, no I did n't!
Oh yeah he do n't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home.
I said well I hope you enjoy.
I know.
Yeah well yeah.
Mm yeah talking about that now he's out the way basically what he was gon na say was, as simple as this.
well it do n't matter does it?
Yeah no he was just saying that head office they'll dictate to them like anybody else so he said I've got to have erm the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
Yeah but I have n't that's what he saying, but he said what I would n't do is ju, do n't just say right phrum there's.
there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right sort of over the next month but he said basically I can not do anything until erm the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I ca n't do anything for you until then.
Who?
No no point in me well anyway when she.
Mm so he said erm, that's the situation he said but you can forget your business he said, as far as I'm concerned he said, you've lost for two years so he said consequently he said you're gon na lose this year are you?
I said well I would n't be surprised.
So he said well all I can say is he said you wan na just forget that erm.
Yeah exactly do n't get involved at all.
So he said well how do you feel about your business?
So I said well you know, I ca n't just wind it up over the next six months, I said er what I wan na do I said is erm I got ta carry it on for that transit for that Orion till I finished anyway so it's got ta go another year so I said well what I'm feeling about doing I said is er just sort of keeping a finger in the pie I said, he said, if I'd said tomorrow, if I had finished the whole the tomorrow I've got ta buy a car I can buy it finance so I'm gon na get no tax relief on the H P I get no depreciation no nothing like that I said so at least if I still self employed I can if I have the sort of two or three vehicles or whatever three, four, five vehicles but I said at least I can have some erm and I can then sort of they would be more utilised, where as I said at the moment we got more vehicles than we really need to keep full capacity so he said yeah, yeah fair enough then.
I said well that's what is, I said if you look at it the depreciation is so heavy compared with the income, and I said and the insurance as well but I said hopefully cos we have n't had any of er any claims at all this year you know, I said I know but all of the insurances of gone up, but I said I'm hoping that we can sort of get the insurance down if possible so he said, yeah fair enough then.
He said well from my point of view anyway at least he said just disregard that completely he said and we will do it on what you earnt, so he said all I can is erm just put in as many hours as you can to get your wages up on that side erm and then by the time we look at that he said, the end of February obviously you'll have December, January and February which will be good months there, I said yeah so he said well then you know erm a hundred pound here and a hundred pound here he said, it all helps to keep the figure up for you so he s.
No, but I mean all I can say is basically erm.
Yeah.
And he said he's quite prepared to do it, he said, there would n't be no problem but he said I can not do it, he said they are.
About thirty three thousand but you see what he said is, head office make the rule and he said and they're not.
No.
That's right, he said what.
Yeah because he said as soon as they see arrears he said they insist that it's paid up and they insist that you have like three months pay them no problem he said.
and then there's no problem.
I said no, but he's.
Yeah.
but he's, he give me a a print out, he said well here's your print out look so he said as soon as.
Yeah but she'll know she'll know that in fact he'll be seeing her.
Yeah he just said you did say I can have some more money, I said well yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah well what I think I'll do.

What?

Marion looked well did n't she?
Yeah.
Yeah well it's.

Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
He said I was talking to him earlier on, I.
just never thought.
No.
That's what I just said when he went up there you see.
I said I dunno how they afford it, I said I ca n't afford to go out one day a week,.
He said the last time I went out he said was December the fifteenth, I said, and I'll tell you something else, that was the last time I went out.
So that's Tu we er.
Thursday.
When?
Ah ye, no I mean like go out for a.
meal or a.
drink a drink.

Yeah.
Hoh!
Oh you know the?
You go down Hill Street.
Yeah and there's er as you go over the top there's like a postman's passage and you go past where you turn into it there's in the corner there.
Well then you ca n't drive only about ten yards further than that then it's the conservative club on the left hand side.
and then nearly next door to the conservative club, the chap that's hiring the minibus from us is called The Horse Fayre Tavern.
And then just as you go in the sort of crossways the new Horse Fayre shopping precinct sort of thing.
and er they got a board out there and had that sort of three twenty five and things like, that's very good.
I put on one kilogram.
I said I could n't finish it put it down.
But I now I do n't pull the wheels you see, I ai n't pulled the wheels you see.
have I?
Less than four months and now and that.
The only problem I used to find was when I used to pull the and get cramp terrible in here.
And I said I do n't thi, he said well I do n't get it!
I said no but you're taller and you're.
pulling a different way, I used to pull it with my legs he pulls it with his back.
cor he said, I'm.
plus my back my he said, I do n't have to keep stiff, I said yeah well that's where you're pulling it but.
I have to pull it with my legs.
That's why I put on the weight, I just stand there all day you see got a load them in and press the button that's all I do all day, I do n't move!
I literally do n't move!

That's bloody hard work on them!
Cor every time I paint, it bloody rains again!
I tell you what mate, he's a.
Very.
Well.
when they and they freeze your bloody bank account like that he I mean, like you say he it's just daft you ca n't do that!
Well yeah but you see they.
Well it's no.
Yeah.
But he was saying you see, what's happened is the they is n't his he just delivers them for the bloke.
and they have these bloody great artics come down and put the stuff in your shed and it was nicked but he said there's in, there's about eighty odd hampers nicked worth about sort of, perhaps four thousand.
quid but the bloke who owns them he's near said they were sort of a couple of hundred or three hundred nicked or something and he put the load in at twenty two thousand quid!
So he said that's all got out of proportion.

He's only insured for eighteen thousand anyway so I said well to be perfectly honest Jim, I said I would n't of thought that the insurance company's gon na pay out eighteen thousand quid without getting some sort insurance investigator down there to sort it out.
I said they'll want to know, where they was, how they was they'll want to know the value of each stuff, what was in it, everything!
They do n't know they is n't gon na just churn out, oh yeah well we'd better pay that mate, eighteen thousand quid!
Too right!
And the building society bloke's told me today they've got a hundred and fifty accounts in the office that are sort of heavily in arrears.

No that's what he said, he said.
he said you are by the number of payments you is n't paid he said you have n't paid for almost a year but he said you have n't money.
He said well you ai n't got much.
Yeah.
Mm I know.
And that's what we're paying per year.
So he said but, he said, the stupid thing is he said, I'm I could.
he said it's it's the twelfth payment which he said is you know, just pay it I said.
Yeah.
So I do.
Yeah.
No well the thing you wan na do then is er, well yo you still got the form have n't you?
You got ta keep the original one.
Yeah well all you got ta do is you know where now mind them.
Jonathan!
You know erm.
where's the easiest place to tell you to find?
No.

If you drive.
Yeah but I'm telling you whe.
Yeah but I'm telling you where you got ta.
pay it.
Well.
yeah if it's in a fortnight then we'll have to pay ours.
That's right.
I went into the back way and and then the laid carpet on the floor look, as you go in the back way concrete.
And they got an old curtain at the back door and then that's all you sort of go through across the corner of the kitchen and he was making a bouquet of flowers and er he was setting them all out like and then when he bought it into me it was all set out in a big thing of cellophane and it'd got two gold strips like.
and all curly at the top and all curly at the bottom and then a big bow be tied round the bottom.
Yeah.
and then er when you go into the room there was another big blanket.
Where the door.
is, there was a big blanket over the door then as you sit here their room was like all the way round to you, and I sat there and the stairs come down, the open stairs come into the room and here is an old brick fire place.
