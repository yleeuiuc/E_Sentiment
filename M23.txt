Are you his father?
I says no I'm his brother-in-law but I know all his details and I said, he was n't here!
And no matter how little re rebate he gets it'll be a help to him, why should he pay for something he did n't get?
Alright?
Then I said, have you got him a house yet?
And she says it's strange, but there's no movement in the Conway Estate there's usually a good turnover of people who're moving in and out.
Wait a minute it's no good there is no movement.
There usually is a, a, a, vacant houses but at the minute it's at a standstill.
Right so that means if there's nobody moving out, John ca n't move in?
He neither filling another form, I says well I'll fill it in tonight for him he'll sign it and if I post it tonight you'll probably get it tomorrow.
I wo n't be in the office she says until er May the fifth and nobody else will deal with it so there you are.
This is what, April the what, the fifteenth, the sixteenth?
What is it?
Yeah, well there you are.
Yesterday was the fourteenth, it is the fifteenth.
What?
He did n't, he did n't fill it in.
Ah he says, what about talking money?
But he does n't want to talk money he's hoping to get that bitch to come back and live with him and she does n't like us!
Well you ca n't blame her.
Jean, we do n't even have see them you know what I mean?
He does n't have to pass our door to get the bus stop, he does n't have to pass our door to get to the schools.
or the children.
He does n't have to pass this way to go to the shops.
It will be handy for me though.
Well Christ well what did you get yesterday you found her clothes, her trousers and her knickers!
She must have been staying there at the weekend!
Aye get her end away he's, he's no scruples!
Here, put these clothes away.
Did you phone Kate?
No, well phone her see how she is.
Now if she says why we were not here or say say she tells you she called on Saturday and we were out just say to her Raymond was drinking stout!
Fuck her I was drinking stout on Saturday night and normally do n't do it because we've simply no money! on the vodka and say it was n't even enough to buy a carry out but do n't say it unless she says she was here!
No.
She mentioned the silver teapot to John.
I said to him we made her a cup of coffee out of a teapot that was bought and she says she was talking about it.
I did n't want John thinking that I said he would get her one.
In that top one?
Can you not put them in the bottom of the cupboard and get rid of that bag?
Jean, that's what drawers are for! everything, look at that dir lo look at that now!
I can take some down and put them in the cupboard.
Are you sure Jean there's not a box of soap in there?
There is.
What?
No it's not the soap in that box is lying down in the coal hole.
The soap out of the box is lying in the coal hole, the empty box is in the bin.
Hey listen you see these er the stuff you have in that cupboard there, the hot press.
Now, you'll have to go through it right?
There's no use in keeping things that you're not gon na use okay?
Now you, if you get rid of a lot of, of a lot of the rubbish right?
Do you realize how quickly your clothes would dry in there in the hot press?
No serious, in summer, it's alright now good wind blow you can get the clothes dried in a reasonable time but in the winter you ca n't.
right?
They would even dry quicker than if you put them over the clothes horse cos that's what those slats are for.
There's no use keeping things you do n't need Jean, and you do n't know anybody that needs them!
John never mind him!
Ha for God's sake Jean if she's gon na move back with him she'll not want your stuff!
That's why she wo n't move back in with him, cos she says there's too much stuff there reminds him reminds her of her his ma or your ma.
at the time Jean.
I do n't want to ge to get involved, but you just ca n't help and I do n't want any of this shit out!
Now watch this.
And from what I've heard about her she's always her mouth now!
There oh Christ!
Remember me at the weekend to look I think it's only fuse right?
Now if it's only a fuse like mine I'll get him one and we'll be able to get the computer back down cos er the like right?
Now these Easter eggs, I hope nobody's touching them!

Is she, she's in the.
Yeah.
But if she.
Yes.
I understand that.
But if she's living with someone else how does she explain her absence the weekend she goes to John?
Aye, but.
But, I, what I ca n't understand is, why all of a sudden does he want her back and see the children, well for over a year he kept her away?
Told the children lies.
You know that saying Jean?
No.
Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
This dog here's taking over this house!
John's dog's not too well.
No.
He's very listless.
I said to Kelly Ann today, maybe it's fucking, erm sorry, maybe he's dying.
Cor!
I should n't have said it.
I was telling Stephen today the story of a did I ever tell you?
Did I ever tell you Raymond?
My first job driving a lifting in the Harrow Street?
There was a Mr and Mrs, Stephen was and there was a Mr and Mrs, the caretakers, and they lived in the third floor of a flat there.
And, the first day I started right enough, they were awful kind, awful kind they were English people, I think.
They were.
He had a bad arm.
But anyway, er well I'd, God forgive me!
I dunno, er yes, I was eating jam, bread and jam today.
And anyway, the first day she gave me right enough, she came round every morning with my breakfast and brought it into the lift for me.
But, the first day she gave me bread with jam and butter on it.
Now, you know I can take jam or butter.
That's the most revolting taste!
And instead, instead of telling the woman I I pretended to eat it could n't finish it I put it down the lift shaft.
See?
The next morning the same thing happened and I still had n't the courage to tell her.
Cos I was that grateful for her, you know, making it.
Jesus Christ, Jean!
You wan na have seen the butter and the jam, and the smell of it!
I can smell it now!
Oh God!
But anyway this went on for weeks and weeks, and I kept on it down the lift shaft.
Instead of taking it out to the back and throwing it in the bin.
Right.
Never thi never thinking!
The lift shaft was about three foot deep.
Sorry!
Th the the well of the lift, you know from the er, ju, when you went to the bottom floor.
I would say there was a drop of about three feet, right?
Down.
So anyway, after fucking weeks and weeks and weeks I had come out to me one day, and Mr came out and he said to me he had a wee bucket and shovels and he says er bring me down to the first floor so I opened to let him out and he gets out and he says to me, now take her half way between the first and second floor and stop her.
And I says okay, but why?
He says I'm gon na clean the lift shaft.
Well Holy Jesus!
Oh God!
He says, I clean it every now and again.
People throwing, you know, cigarette packets and all down it.
Oh my God!
So when I could n't say a word, so he was able to open the lift door, you see, from outside.
The lift was immobilized.
Once the door was open it could n't move, so I could n't go down on it.
Well he jumps down into the fucking lift shaft and he slipped on i oh eh well you fucking bastard you!
You bastard!
Honest to God Jean!
He slipped on the jam and the bread and the butter.
Bloody moulded!
Jesus.
Christ!
Oh my God, Jean!
What could I say?
It came up on his elbows and all, and his trousers were covered and there's bloody jam, er this concoction!
Oh Jesus!
Jesus!
No, they were, they were awful kind.
I forget what I said to them but the they forgot, the next, I do n't think I got a bit of grub ever, since then.
Not until he left.
But I it was only butter and the jam today that er, thi this came into my head.
Oh my God!
That was nineteen fifty three.
This is nineteen ninety two.
And I, every now and again I'm embarrassed by it.
Every now and again I think about it and I'm deeply embarrassed.
Jean.
When he slipped in that muck he could have cracked his head against the side of the lift shaft!
And I could n't have been, I could n't get out to help him I was stuck between the first and second floor!
Well I took it up about six or seven feet, you know, from the ground floor.
When I say the first floor, I'm talking about the ground floor and the first floor, you know?
I would n't have let him give it to me.
Remember the time I took to vertigo?
And the minute he walks through your bedroom door, I says no.
I do n't want any injections.
Did he take a sample of urine away?
Oh!
And what did he say?
Oh well, that's good.
Oh!
He wo n't take a breakfast in the mornings any more.
He goes straight to work.
What did he say?
Right.
Raymond.
Drink affects us all different.
There are no two people affected by drink the same way.
Now we're all individuals when it comes to that.
Now, you could be one of the people that drink harmed quicker than maybe, say or maybe I'm ta injured quicker than you with drink.
I mean, there are people who can drink va vast quantities never seems to affect them.
They're up like a lark the next morning.
Jesus!
Me, like I mean, that's got now, my age, I'm not fit for three days!
Well, for two days anyway.
But, it's possible that, the same amount of drink, two people drink, taking the same amount of drink one is affected more badly than the other, or worse than the other.
Yo it's possible you could be one of those.
So you wan na be careful, like.
There's no way, Raymond, you should be able to drink two or three of those bottles o of that cider in ne in the one night, it's not good for you!
Or vodka either!
Well you, you do n't drink that amount, but you know what I mean.
Stop,.
Jean I'd love a vodka now!
I'd a love a vodka and coke!
I'd give al almost anything.
I would sell you!
No, I would n't.
I'm only, you know I'm only joking.
I know there's not, maybe that's why I've Where did you get that lemonade up the stairs Raymond?
Inside the ottoman.
No, no.
Raymond said to me the other day, I asked him was there any lemonade?
And he said yes.
He went up and got a bottle of Sasperella he said to me there was two bottles left.
So when the Sasperella was brought down, that was at the end of it.
And there was two bottles.
No I did n't!
I got no orange Jean!
Jean, you did n't!

Where's the dog?
Raymond, you're like something out of the Wizard of Oz!

I wonder where William is?
It will it will cost money.
There's a wee square I dunno what you call the material, bakelite or whate, not bakelite, it's a it's for use in electrical insulation and when you it's cracked I think, it's not the grill, the wires of the grill the actual Patch!
Johnny, get that dog down!
No.
It's, the thing that you push it into, the two prongs will do.
No, the two pro, the thing that the two prongs sit in is cracked so naturally say it had to go into a hole that size, right?
And then, each side of it's making contact and it's gone into a hole that size, and it's moving it ai n't making contact.
He, bet you he's got toilet roll up there!

But I've now taken this out tonight.
Yeah, I expect that Johnny's, do you ever do any?

The tape thing.
Put it back on the television.
You wo n't Johnny?
No it does n't.
It only does error for something wrong with the machine.
The game's over.
When you pull this out and it goes the next time start it turn it over, rewind it to the front.
Just turn the machine right o tape right over and use the other side.
See what happens.
And you'll need that machine there back a bit from the television as I've already told you.
Aye, it's moving this.
Now all you got ta do is to move, that's right!
No!
Now do n't look funny now Willie!
And stretching it.

You're very unpleasant when you're like that boy!
No they do n't.
That's the terrible thing Jean!
They think they do.
There now, stop it!
Just stop your tape first and er turn it over to the other side first.
Turn it round.
Now wind it back.
Right now.
No Willie!
Stop it!
That's right.
No, he has n't got a machine that cuts out.
See what I mean?
Excuse me.

Now you try and break that again son and I'll put a foot in the back of your head!
It's as simple as that.
You get irritable at this time of night when you get tired and you get ill mannered, and I do n't like it!
So go to your bed if you ca n't behave normal.
Well then it's rewound is n't it?
Then press them two buttons whatever you do.
There's an error.

Oh God, Jean!
Will you give it a rest love!
Please.
All for a game.

Sit in the chair.
Touch nothing!
I should fucking try again.
His mate Neil give it him.

Alright, just a minute.
Just a minute.
Hold on now.
And now it goes up again because there's a V A C Onyx standard, that's an Onyx standard machine.
And there's a V A T, V A C twenty expanded which has more gadgets on it.
That may be a expanded game.
Which we have n't got that, the equipment for.
But that.
I might be able to put an ad in the paper for them games.
You wan na see the games they've got for sale in London at Christmas and I have n't.
Right.
Mm.
Right.
Oh I know that.
Right.
Wait a wee second.
Wait a minute.
We'll see.
No.
It's down the bottom.
Well maybe he ca n't drink Jean.
Well you do n't know, to some people fifteen vodkas is nothing.
It's gon na show error again.
Well no.
But then you seem to have graphics on, graphics on it do n't you?
That one over there.
Again, error comes behind it.
Yes.
When the tape's stopped, that's right.
No, you ca n't do that love.
Can some of the can some of the games let's say there's a, one side is n't playing, and try the other?
And some of the games are very slow.
I must say Jean, you did n't do a bad job for woman!
Shut the right door Willie.
Easy!
Please, we're gon na sit here all day.
I did n't see Willie impressing the new girl.
Er, you'll have to see what happened.
There it is, the machine's stuck.
Well not till I, we'll wait and see what happens now.

So she told us the last time she was round she was going on a course for that sort of thing and she said now would you like to try it said fair enough.

I see them down to their dinner and I have the pots done before I take a bite.
Oh aye.
I hate dishes sitting done, oh fuck I.
Forget it, forget it.
Oh I do n't mind, I do n't mind.
But do you, you know the best way to do it?
Now say for instance er I do the pots.
because there's no room in the wee.
rack for fucking plates, so I put them away and the best way to do it is if sit at the table, you wash and I'll dry or I'll dr you er dry and I'll wash, well what.
Half, half the time.
Yeah.
But all.
Yes, yes but if you do that you're, you're, you're tea towel's soaking and at the end of the night.
nothing's getting dried.
You can dry no gla a gla what does a glass look like if it's had a di dry with a damp cloth?
Fuck all.
Oh well it, right enough, yeah.
Do a cup of coffee now Jean for God's.
I hate dishes.
And I hate anything sitting on the table top.
If I had, if I had room I'd have nothing, toaster and that I hate it all.
But yet I happened to say to Carole one night, she says no I love to see what I bloody own well I suppose it's you've got microwave and a wee oven or whatever.
Aha.
Electric one's far safer is n't it?
Oh aye.
Mhm.
I would n't have one about now.
Yes.
Oh we've plenty of room there for that you know.
But then the.
minute it's cold I put it in.
put the lid on it and put it in.
But they're far safer Dawn.
Aye.
Well.
Oh right.
Use Jif.
Och I use Jif.
I'll tell you what I do you know like it goes black?

You see a paint scraper?
I scrape it.
Oh aye.
Scrape it, then I get the Jif on my finger, you know round the cloth round the finger.
do that.
Please.
But er I'll tell you the most dangerous thing a tin of peas, if you put it into your pot there's sugar in it, if you look at that, the ingredients.
on a tin of Batchelor, there's sugar in them.
right?
Now one day, you ca n't leave it on the hob, one day we were sitting here and I do n't normally, if I put anything on I sit in there rea you've seen me go in on a Sunday.
reading the paper and all while I'm watching whatever's on.
but we let it run over and the sugar the hob and it, there's, there's a chunk out of it.
it's actually bubbled the glass, there's a big groove in it, you can see it in the back ring, I'm telling you.
And if we'd.
if we, if we'd've left it long enough.
it would right through the element.
But I use a paint scraper.
Now, I mean if you run your finger over it, right?
And you can feel where, where the rough edge is.
and you just very easy with Jif that.
I would say well use Mr Muscle on it oven cleaner, but you have to.
wh where you put it.
I've used a paint scraper.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Oh we.
That's right that's right.
Well I, I've, but er, no but er the only reason you have n't got it off, if you use Jif, I've used Jif.
Well I do n't know what it does, but the only reason you ca n't get it off is you're not working it, it's hard work to get it off Dawn.
Well I'll show you the, the what do you call it, the back, what the sugar did, and I'm putting it down to sugar.
What son?
I'm sorry love, I'll do it you know that.

So if they can do that, they can look up anything.

Oh they're showing Naked Gun on the television.

Och he knows you're in safe hands like when you come round here.
Oh fuck.

That's going back.
I said it's going back, I did n't say it was stolen.
And left her poor st her brother standing in the hall.
We came up from York Street today, you know we walked.
Court?
And er whatever way I brought them we ended up in Street and you know the King George the Sixth Hall?
The big hall there?
Well our company decided to send us for a fucking first aid course and this, it's er most embarrassing on this particular night we'd stopped in er in the Chapel Hill in Lisburn.
I was drinking Monk and Monk was a heavy beer so fuck I gets out of the car and fucking oh fuck, but anyway said to me look I'll go up, say my name, and I'll bring you home, I was living with my sister at the time and I sat on a wee low wall, I'm just the wall, fu fuck I, in the middle of the day, nobody, they were just drinking er Dawn this is way were, it's fucking maybe twenty five years ago, twenty six and er fuck he sat me on the wall he had to s I could n't see he says to me er fucking I heard a voice, Raymond like this is the exam tonight you'll have to sit there.
I says alright Dawn er Graham, I could n't lift my fucking head.
So I'm sitting and getting worse if I opened my eyes it went like that, the whole fucking sky was going round.
So I'm sitting all I can hear, I'll never forget it ah God help him fucking somebody from ah Go God help him next thing will we get an ambulance?
Say no I'm alright and I must've lifted my head, all I could hear was this old scraggy voice like a witch, ah serve the fucking bastard right, the fucking honest to fuck, so I must've sat for another half an hour and I knew I had to go that way to get home.
I ended up on the front fucking wheels of a pushbike.
I swear to God, in Willington Place I'll, pitch black, never forget it.
And all I remember was saying oh!
There between my legs, the front wheels, and I ended up holding the handlebars and staring into this wee boy's face a look of sheer fucking terror on his face,.
fucking, oh j I do n't know how I got home.
All I can hear to this, to this day remember is flashing lights and doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo go home you bastard!
Doo I must've crossed every fucking road.
Oh aye?
Sure her her sister was coming er down, er t Carole was coming down Donegal Avenue one night and said to John fuck some woman's gon na have a rough time she says.
ah she said she saw this fella hitting the wall and hitting the football halfway out in the road, it was fucking me.
Ah but everybod er sorry, they did things for me.
bastard.
if you ev if she ever says to you she has n't seen you since whatever it was, you say Carole it works both ways, I have n't seen you either.
No.
Like she was n't too busy when she brought the youngsters.
home last Saturday, or whatever it was, to come round.
See she'll always.
No, no no no once every.
She buys them and takes them to and all.
but the point is she uses us to get to John, so it's like would you ask John.
And I feel like saying.
Yes exactly.
Exactly.
Well no, a mother, a mother might keep a family together in the sense that they all meet there on a Saturday.
but a mother ca n't make the family like each other any better.
you know?
They ca n't.
See your mum was te terrorized of Carole.
Yes.
And that's wrong but if you, if you told Carole that she would n't believe you.
But I know she was.
And I'll tell you better than that.
I'll tell you better than that and I did n't know until her John told me.
He says do you know that they get cooked ham sandwiches and you get toast?
I says you're joking.
When Carole and John went down, they were sat down, cooked ham sandwiches.
When Jean and I went down the toaster was put on.
We got toast.
I did n't know it.
Yes, mhm.
And made them a f and they look for their fry every Saturday and I stopped doing it.
Like when your mother got to that age, as John told me, you bring her in the food.
she does n't bring it in for you.
Now I thought it was wrong, I even stopped them getting a fry.
Fucking pan was rotten anyway.
Mm.
