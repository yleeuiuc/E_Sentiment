And that, straight away he come back and said that he'd got it.
Well, we knew he'd got it because.
they told her.
Well I do n't know about that.
But they told her.

Now, they told her that you see.
And cos I says, well what does she do int meantime?
I says, she ai n't got anything!
Cos he might have said sod it!
I'm not gon na give her it.
Or it could be three or four days before it arrives.
Well what does he do?
Just shove it.
Ah, well she's alright then.
Well when he said how much he'd got, I thought seventy six and seventy three is hundred and forty six.
Right.
So he's took seventy three and he's giving her seventy three she would have earned sixty three pound on her own!
That's a tenner a week they're giving for him!
That book she sent back, it.

They were for our house but not hers.
She took them down and that, and washed them and d'ya know, she's daft as a brush!
Honest!
She's daft as a brush.
She come round, she says, do you like my curtains?
I'm just about to put them back up.
She got a blue three piece suite, a blue carpet, there's blue int curtains, and I says them curtains do n't match your three piece suite, they look stupid!
So she says, what d'ya mean they look stupid?
I says, pure white backgrounds!
I says, with them co.
I know, it's green.
And she believed me that it did n't match three piece suite or carpet and it was stupid, and that sh and she says what shall I do about them?
I said.
Yeah.
I know.
Yes.
Me and Gary.
altered them.
We did well!
Trying to decide whether to take them down off my windows and put some poles up.
Do n't know.
Cos I were gon na have these off you were n't I?

Oh!
I've shoved them in.

Oh eh!
Yeah.
Them drop things.
Yeah.
What?
Okey-cokey.
Oh yes!
Tell you all about it.
I told her!
A secret.
No.
I'm gon na have one of those.
I won.
another competition.
A thousand pounds worth of holiday accommodation in the U K.
England.
In England.
And, I really had to answer these questions.
Cos I'm clever!
I do n't know.
Not seen it yet.
That record player do n't bloody play!
My records nee go it it plays for a bit, then it goes brurgh!
Er!
Ee!
Ee!
Ee!
Ee!
Brurgh!
And then it goes alright.
No.
There's something to do with the slow, fast thing.
I'm sick of it!
Ca n't listen to my records.
What time do you start in that place?
Oh!
Yeah, I've seen you going in about half fiveish.
I won another competition as well!
I won some money.
I won some money.
I do n't know till February.
I got we.
I do them int papers and all sorts.
But I were right disappointed at that thousand pounds worth of holiday accommodation!
I won second prize.
I got that and a midi hi-fi system.
But presentation's tomorrow.
People going and collecting and I'm hoping first prize winner's there.
I'll swap er, midi hi-fi system and that for her first prize.
Now, you know Irene?
And she's sixty five.
Well you know Chris is in Africa?
Well her granddaughter gets married in July.
She got invitation and everything, there's no way on God's earth she can get six hundred pound.
No way!
If her and Fred go it's twelve hundred quid.
So I, every time it says win some Air Miles and things like that, and that.
competition I entered was win a thousand pounds worth of Air Miles.
And I thought, oh great!
I'll enter that competition, you never know I might win it.
I'll give it to Irene so she can go to Africa.
And, cos it's twenty seventh of July you know, wedding.
And I thought, if I can win owt like that it'll be nice for her.
Cos she's got a great grandson she's never laid eyes on.
So, I thought, I'll do that.
And I won second prize which is England!
Tt!
So, that one must have been for abroad.
and this, second prize, is for England.
And I got England.
You see, first prize has n't got, you see, because, they put your number in a draw, for the person to win the midi hi-fi system.
and I got the midi hi-fi system.
So I've got the.
thousand pound, and that.
But I've got to use mine int U K.
What?
Satellite?
Yeah.
You what?
Mhm.
Oh!
She is.
I know, you need another one.
Yeah.
You need that system for it like our Arthur's got.
Like we've got.
That one and that one.
You'd have kept it if you'd have had that.
Oh!

So, he's rang every day since and he keeps getting this person, that says er er, we'll pass your message, we'll pass your message, we'll get back to you, I'll get back to you.
I says, you know what you want to do now?

Because, if not, I'm going to see my solicitor in the morning, cos if you wo n't speak to me, you can speak to him instead!
I says, and I bet they call you back.
They wo n't ring back.
But I said, just threaten with solicitors then.
He ca n't bloody see!
He's blind as a bat!
Maggie wears glasses, but she wo n't outside.
Nearly two hundred quid he paid for a pair of glasses and she sat on them did n't she?
No.

T-shirt.
Right.
Here are.
That's so as you can watch it looking at telly!
More than likely!
More than likely!

Well he's got someone to talk to his while.

I expect you'd be alright if he talked back to you.
You'd know about it then!
Yeah, you blank er bits off.
I've got headphones and everything so you can come back to a certain and take it.
She said.
to leave swearing and all that on.
And she says to leave swearing on.
She says, but if you listen to it, and then if you do n't think that should be there you can go over it.
You could.
No, Flo come I stopped her conversation half way through.
It's a bit like.
with John and Janice.
You do n't hear nowt.
He's like that are n't you?
He's.
he sat up last night, he sat up last night we was gon na watch the ten o'clock movie on telly with me.
Cos it finishes at half eleven, so I says to him, oh great!
You're not working tomorrow you can watch movie wi me.
He says, yeah, alright.
So I got my cushions and I laid here and he got his cushions and he were laid there and he says to me, are you taping this?
I says, no I'm gon na watch it.
I thought he's going to sleep again.
Quarter past ten, turned round, snoring away!
Then, he were being a pig last night.
I says to him, with him breaking down other night his dinner went to dog.
The night before I kept it hot, and hot, and hot, and hot, and by time we did get it at quarter to eight I says to him, oh this is horrible, this!
So last night, I thought, I wo n't do anything till he comes in but we'd got company and er, they went outside, they were having a look at car engine and that, telling us what were wrong, you know.
And, so I says to him d'ya fancy going to fish shop?
So he decided he wanted chips, pie, curry, loads of scraps and bread and everything and he eat every bit of it up!
Did n't you?
He's not bothered!
I can tell.
You used to have two buck teeth but you have n't now.
Yeah.
You know, before you could n't see your thingy that.
You're going to National Tyres on North Bridge.
And they're going to balance your wheels.
I do n't know about checking and balancing, I just says balancing.
I'll let you.
It's four pound something a wheel there.
So.
well they says to go there, get an invoice take it into the insurance and they will send us a cheque back out.
They're gon na deduct it.
I phoned up put Maggie on t ' phone, told her sa tell her what this bloke had said and, they said, just a minute, that they'll get in touch wi insurance and phone us back.
Well they phoned back and they said, can you tell your husband to take his car to National Tyres er, that insurance has sent him, and could they give him an invoice for the insurance company.
Like, we pay, give.
them an invoice, he's got to take the invoice into insurance.
they will deduct that off the value.
I think.
send us it, and they can have the rest.
And they says, check it.
Well they wo n't give him it straight away, they'll see to you first.
They always do.
But I says, that they were, I, that he were n't satisfied when it were vibrating and that.
And he says, gerrit checked or summat.
So he's gon na ask them what he does about the vibrating.
No!
I dunno.
But, you're going in insurance.
You're telling them yoursen.
I'm sick of telling them!
I'm sick of car!
They're no good!
D'ya know, everybody we've.
spoke to since then, they says, why the heck did n't you say summat?
You should n't have took it there!
One fella were told they did his erm summat to his engine and it blew up did n't it?
His engine blew up!
Er, Dennis, who we were talking to last night, he says, you must be absolutely mental!
He says that his mate bought a car from there and, he were a undecided about this clocking this time, what's, what call it?
But you know on his log book, last person that had the car he went down to see them, and they told him that it were thirty thousand over from when they sold it.
He went to see person who selt it.
And, they were on, more on about that.
I says, ah marvellous!
I says, you do n't hear a word about anybody till you go.
And then afterwards.
True.
Mine has, mine's.
Guess what?
Mine.
wants two more miles on my clock and I've done a thousand mile on my.
I know, but well mine's a W registered, yours is a D!
It shows tha.
I only go a fair way.
I only do Irene's on it, and that's my lot.
And it's.
Well mine's according to my log book there's three on it.
I've heard of.
and I've had it three year.
And I ai n't done, I ai n't got it to a thousand yet.
But, it's all ready for M O T now.
Supposed to take it in for M O T.
It's your electrics innit?
I've had it three years.
Well, if you're in knock before you go and start it.
That's right.
Have you?
Where you going?
I should n't have asked should I really!
It's a lovely place Skeggy!
Did I just give him some money, I did n't did I?
Oh!
Better give him some money.
I was gon na give him cheque book and then I thought, no.
No.
Cos you've already told her.
Er, cos she come today and she says forgot book.
That's true.
I know quite a few.
Sarah does it.
My mate she does it.
She did up to moving but she lived at Anthorpe and she's not mentioned it since, so I'll have to ask her if she does Avon.
Cos I used to get it off of her.
You what?
She says she's only five bags did n't she?
No!
She's not allowed five bags, she's got to have an order of five bags.
One for hersen, and four other people.
Five bags and over.
No, if she ai n't got five bags then, the what you call it?
She ca n't have any.
No, she ca n't have anything.
I got a sarong.
Er an Avon bag actually I got er three bags with Avon.
Handbag er.
Yeah, a shopping bag that's alright.
well mine's whi it's a yellow bag.
I got, a shopping bag, that were a creamy colour with wi A's all over it.
Let's have a look, I do n't think I've got that one.
Yeah.
I've got umbrella, a blue one.
I got oh I got a what they call an'all!
Erm erm I did!
It's Oh!
You know when er, you're going on away or on t ' beach or summat and you put your toiletries in and you can put a towel and that?
Like that.
Yeah.
Sort of, with that figure.
Yeah.
I got her one of them.
What I do is, I roll a towel up and that, and put, take them down on t ' beach, you know, cos I could put my purse in and that.
A bit of money.
That's what I do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Cos she had them in a plastic bag.
It's erm Yeah!
I'm looking at you!
A.
toiletry bag, yes.
Are they for men?
Oh!
Cos Steve got one and I got one.
I got a blue one and he got a black one.
You know, it sounds I spent.
Well it past half past ten, you think he'd be up and getting ready for work.
He might be up.
He do n't know his dad's in this morning.
He's always hiding.
Yeah.
He'll go out and get that five to ten bus or five past ten bus.
Stops upstairs all the time.
Cos I've upset his girlfriend!
I do n't know.
I told him he'd better tell his friends, or his girlfriends, that when they call at our house if they do n't give names, they're not talking to him!
I says, cos I have n't the faintest idea who they are.
I've says your Mark, I says, he always says, is that Mrs?
It's Mark.
Will you ask Steven if I can talk to him please?
And, there's one called Gavin, he rings up, and the girlfriend, he did have, whether it's still same one, I do n't know called Sarah.
Well, I says to him, I'm getting sick of these calls cos you do n't know if it's for him or him.
We have the same name.
And er I picked it up other night, says, can I ta speak to Steven?
I said, no!
So she di still did n't say her name!
So, she says, will you give Steven a message?
I says, no!
Talk to him when you see him.
Well will you ask Steven to call me back?
I says, no!
She give me no telephone number, no name nothing!
So, she said, oh!
Alright, and put phone down.
And I still did n't know who it were.
I thought, if I keep saying no she'll say, well it's Sarah or whoever but, no chance!
No name!
No phone number!
No nothing!
He's got six lights up front.
He's just had to alter them hisen!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dipped lights though, it's just like a guess.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
That's what's missing ont front of ours.
When he crashed we've not had anything replaced.
Cos, before you crash we had six lights on t ' back and we had eight on t ' front.
Cos he's got them four headlights with.
the either side, then below the bumper thing, we had the fog lights and above the bumper we had two spotlights.
Now, on the back I bought him some extra fog lights for back and I bought him them fog lights that goes int window.
D'ya know?
So if.
the light int window, and on bumper and fog light.
He come back, we've got headlights on t ' front two fog lights and we got brake lights on t ' back.
No fog lights, no nothing.
That's all we've got!
I says, to him, there's six lights missing off here.
I says, they cost me over two hundred quid, I says, for the six lights!
But, them at Car Care turned round and says, it's not on t ' invoice.
All we keep getting off them is I says, you mean to say, we're paying two and half thousand pounds worth of repairs, I says, and they're not done?
And then when we went for wheel balancing told us to take it back for balancing and tracking, they turned round and says we're not doing it.
Take it to another garage.
We told Maggie that.
So I says to Maggie, we'll phone insurance, I put her on t ' phone, and she said he were, he were right clever with her!
And er that's why they have n't got in contact and that.
So he, took it back before and put brand new bonnet that they've put on.
Did n't fit!
And he says, when he gets it up to sixty mile an hour on t ' motorway it's still vibrating.
So, he's gon na go int insurance this morning, tell them that er bonnet's still vibrating and they've supposed to have done it twice and that, because of er ask them where he can take to have all these repair jobs done.
You know, checked over.
Cos, he went in there summat to do wi headlights or summat, one were like up and down or summat.
And he went in and he said they have n't even bloody welded this!
They've done a tack.
I says, you're alright, I said, front radiator's gon na bleeding drop off!
So he's gon na see about that this morning.
I says to him, take a day off work for, I says, for God's sake!
So he took today off.
Yeah.
I've got another one upstairs.
Do you know, fellas, who'd have them?
One minute, she starts collecting one thing then you start collecting another thing Christmas, he come home with one of them.
That lad at work, that John what they call him?
He give him one.
And er he's got hundreds of them apparently.
So he's decided he wants to collect them now.
I've got so.
I've got Kelloggs.
Is it Kelloggs?
No do n't touch them.
That was the er, last one that she'd seen they said that.
Them Kelloggs.
They're Walkers crisps.
They're Walker crisps.
And er.
I said to Maggie I says, Steve's collecting cars I says, it do n't matter if it's int box or not, I says, if they're int box they're staying in a box.
I says, and I'm buying him a rack for the ones not in a box.
Oh.
We do n't get Tetleys teas though.
We do n't get that at all.
I always used to.
He could n't stop buying.
He says, there's not much point in getting P G or Tetleys from one tea bag and making four.
cups.
Cos what he does, he puts a tea bag in a cup pours about that much water on takes the tea bag out and tops it right up with water so he can see bottom of cup.
And then he uses same tea bag again.
That's why.
That's just not strong.
I doubt it like.
Cos you never do do you?
Yeah.
What?
It's been there a fortnight and I keep asking everybody if they want to try it.
And I told Steve to drink it, and he says no, and wi you mentioning Tetleys and I do n't.
You have been in my bag again!
I can tell you have n't!
So, in that case, you've dropped it.
Tt!
Because he do n't go till half past ten this morning.
Changed my mind.
You'll have to save it till Paul comes back for the car.
Ah!
Will you save some more and then you can send for.
a gon na save me some Tetley tea tokens for a car.
Cos she has Tetleys, and we do n't.
Just give her that tea, it's Tetley tea.
Save.
D'ya know.
Yes!
That's what it says.
o n't telly.
It's not.
Cos Jack does and all cos he's got one.
In fact, I'm gon na get his present.
That's what it says, if you do n't like the tea, you get a free jar!
Did I give you a diary?
I ca n't remember if I did cos I've been picking them up.
Every time I go int bank they, just leave them on t ' counter, they've been there weeks and weeks.
And normally, they're all gone so, and I thought, oh!
I got one though.
I give Maggie one for, today.
It's there.
Put it back in there.
Under there look.
Under there.
Ah!
Like that.
So now it has n't got nowt with it?
D'ya know, I ke I've had them in my bag I keep forgetting to give them to anyone.
Got your?
No, it's that one, big'un's in my drawer.
Ooh!
It might be in there.
If I did that with my rings, just threw them like that, he'd go absolutely apeshit!
Would n't you?
Well you're not working for three days, you've got three days off!
No.
You've got a day off of work, a day, and a day off.
Yeah.
I do.
Oh!
Well that makes your total to four bags of coal.
Oh aye.
It's a meter.
Token meter.
it ca n't be done.
A quarter meter for the.
No alright then.
As usual.

D'ya know.
you get worse you do!
Would you like a cig?
Yeah.
Are n't I kind to you?
I spend all your money on you and you say no!
No it int, because I never ever light it in the morning do I?
I light.
it later on so it's ready for you coming in.
I would if my kitchen.
Got the fridge in kitchen.
Our fridge is in there.
If I run fridge from there back into conservatory, I could put this there and sit in kitchen and shut the door.
It was.
But somebody put shelves in and everything else and what have you, so it do n't fit.
It's all full.
And then, they've just had the gas tank down the full'un.
I know.
Yeah.
I want another one.
I've got three gas tanks and they were all empty over Christmas so last time he got paid, I filled two up.
You know er.
, nineteen pound.
Yeah!
Yeah.
. I gi him a twenty pound note and he give me some change.
For two.
Yeah.
You know, Tescos?
Straight across road there's a garage there.
They sell them.
And it's nine pound, did I say nine pound fifty a tank?
Either nine or nine pound fifty a tank.
That's where I get it from.
About thirty nine quid they charged me for three.
You wan na go here.
Bloody hell!
That's three quid cheaper.
I'd go there if I were you.
Yeah.
Get it filled.
So this has been.
running a month has n't it?
You got paid a month ago.
Every.
I start off with three.
Oh I reverse.
I start with three and then, I think, phworgh!
It's getting hot in here.
And turn it down to two.
And then, I either leave it like that or turn it to one.
Do n't spill it.
Yeah.
On a dinner time when I go out on a dinner time I leave it on.
And I do n't know why.
I just leave the one bar on.
and then it's right warm when I come in.
I use it all morning.
I've usually got it on when you're here all morning have n't I?
Sa it saves coal.
But so far, that's why I chitted at him this morning about that coal because I've been using this all morning, I've not been lighting fire till between one and three o'clock.
And I have four so far it's four weeks, have n't I?
That's a four, a four, a three, and a three.
And I use the fire too.
That what?
Somebody's nicking them!
So.
You see, they know him do n't they?
You see, if Bill comes over he has a go at Bill, even though he knows Bill, but because he do n't see him that much he has a go at him.
But at least.
they're, and they're not.
And what we noticed, is, we've got a spring there but what and there's been a trail of coal right up our.
He's lost as much.
I bought.
I had the two of them for Christmas and it did n't.
did n't even last us into New.
Year.
And I says, I'm not having this!
So I thought, well he knows I know.
Oh they do!
You just tell Maggie.
Cos I heard Maggie so someone the someone's thieving Kath's coal.
And she's going mad about it!
Well we've locked the bottom half, cos Steve got a lock and we locked the bottom half.
And, but the it broke.
So, gon na have to buy one.
Well Johnny's supposed to have had one that were a fortnight ago.
And I says to Steve, I says, I ca n't keep affording this!
I says, between the electric and that, I says, thirty nine pound a week, I says, every week, I says, is getting a bit ridiculous!
Cos in that electric meter, I do n't know what they've done to it!
I phoned it up and says the fella had been out, you know, they change, update it.
every so often, they've got these little card things well they shove them in and it clicks all these numbers up so I used to buy one token.
so every fortnight I bought twenty pounds worth.
Well, I've got to buy twenty pounds worth one week.
and ten pound week after, and ten pound week after.
to last me for one month, because we've got to put it on.
I keep.
And my bill, like, come in and seventy odd!
I paid hundred and twenty quid on top of this for electric, and they billed me seventy odd!
And er.
They says, that fella's coming to me, he's supposed to be coming out.
And reset it to.
And I says, I'll tell you what, I said, wait till this quarter's over.
I says, you make the bill up.
I says, if there's owt owing to you.
or owt owing to me, I says, we'll do it that way and then you come.
That's what she wanted.
What's that, after six o'clock?
After seven?
Half past seven?
I usually only put it, put it on a bit before.
After I heard that, I said.
I've normally got telly on in the evenings.
Yeah.
True.

Once we got to sorted, I'm gon na take her.
Well, before they put that token in it, then my bills used to come in about fifty, sixty pound.
But since they put the token meter in, I've just found they're charging me nine pound for token meter as well as the meter!
You know, you get charged for your meter?
Cos I ca I were querying on t ' bill, I says, why is it two meters?
Er, because he's got to come out and read it.
I says, he do n't have to come out and read that at all!
I says, there's nowt on it!
I says, I shove cards in, I says, apart from it telling how much you've put in, I says, there's nowt to read on it!
They swear black and blue, they charge you for that meter as well!
I'm being charged for two meters.
So it pushed bill up.
At the price the coal is, I am, because if I'm buying four bags at nineteen pound for four bags.
and it's eight pound fifty a bag for smokeless, I ca n't afford.
four of them.
I says to Steve, I may as well buy a ten pounds worth of anything else.
Ai n't got radiators have you?
Ai n't got radiators are you?
Yeah.
True.
But he says we're moving.
He's been saying that over a year.
And he's still insisting that he wants to move.
He do n't like it.
down this area.
Have you noticed.
I ai n't put in token.
Well, take back that twenty pence token.
I were gon na say I thought it had.
I were n't sure.
You can have two cups ca n't you?
Have to tell Maggie that she ca n't do the lollipop.
I had a phone call, and you know that place I were going this afternoon?
Midi hi-fi and all that.
I told you I'd won one did n't I?
Er.
I've won a midi hi-fi system and a thousand pounds worth of holiday accommodation.
Well what I did, there were a competition, win a thousand pounds worth of Air Miles and I, I entered every single one of them because of Irene.
You know, she's been invited to that wedding in Africa?
And I thought well she's got two chances that way, either I could win, or she could win, or neither of us'll win.
And I thought, if I got that I could give it to Irene and could go wedding.
And er I forgot all about it, entered it last year.
And I got it, of course,.
that says you've won second prize!
Now, I've won a thousand pounds in the United Kingdom.
Not abroad.
And we ca n't go.
It is Friday.
And I'd won.
Ah!
Okay.
He's not with it!
He's not used to having Friday off.
Does she?
Is she?
Yeah.
He's supposed to have been there at half past nine!
I told him that he's.
You watch, he'll get there and say I ca n't find it!
He's never been to National Tyres.
He'll come back and say it cost more than that, give me some money.
It costs.
That's for all wheel balancing.
But, when you have it.
What did she do?
She's alright on t ' chair.
No, but he said four pound odd's dear innit?
Well it's only front that's got to be tracked.
And balanced, innit?
That's not bad.
Well, I'm assuming it's not bad.
I do n't know.
Yeah, he has.
Erm, Charlie puts them on, they took his others out and put these on to balance it.
Oh!
Cos he said, look at these out the thing!
Cos he give him them to fetch a a thing or summat and she went.

Yours sincerely and they've signed it.
They've had to give us one of them.

I says what's that?
She says pardon?
I says what's that?
I says if I'd've wanted a slice of fat and I'd've want burnt tomatoes I says I would've ordered them.
The tomatoes were black as though they'd forgot they were frying them, they looked like they'd stuck them on a grill and just left them there.
and there was about that much bacon on the bacon slice, the rest were fat, I says I'm not paying for that.
Oh yeah.
And she fetched tomatoes back and I says here Steve you can have these tomatoes, I says they're bloody disgusting.
And every so often they kept coming up, everything alright?
I says it is now.
Ooh you've never seen nowt like it, you know when your tomatoes are stuck on and then you shovel them off and I thought they were like that!

You get used to it though do n't you?
I think you do.
Well what you doing helping them paint, drawing and all that?
Yeah.
Have you learnt them to bake yet?
Yeah when Joyce went she were learning them to bake she says.
I think she got that used to baking on her own and then they all tried to dive in it you see and she were saying do n't do that.
Supposed to be showing them what to do and.
you know, making it get a cake each.
Ah.
Well I know er it were Wednesdays Joyce used to come in.
Mm.
Oh!
It's a shame you were n't helping out at Christmas, you'd've been able.
with costumes and everything, you'd've loved that.
I think that's best bit of helping them.
Their faces when they see them with costumes on.
it's great, yeah.
Well it's quarter past any road.
Yeah.
Just have a steady walk.
Ta-ta.
I know you do!
I know.
Maggie does that.
No I had kids on it other day, you'd've laughed but that tells all about it, all God knows what.
what have you all different things.
Yeah.
And then when you've finished doing it you just fill a book in.
Just for a week.
Only one week.
Well it seems easier that way when you think about it dunnit?
Mm it's a lot better.
What, your dictionary or your microphone?
Scanner?
Oh yeah, she's got a thingy erm what is it?
Well over a year have n't you?
Is it three year now?
Yeah she's, she's got it plugged into phone socket on wall and when she buys these things it's got a and it goes.

Mm.
Yeah and she gets points for doing it do n't you, you've been saving them up have n't you?
That's what she gets.
So she's saving them up for a.
Workmates.
Yeah that's it.
Yeah, shows you how to fill it in and everything.
Anyway.
Well I can try hard ca n't I?
Maggie comes from London, that's her real accent.
Cos if you see on top it says regional accent.
That means where you got it from.
No you do n't fill that in, I fill that in.
She says I could put hers down, you says I could put yours so stop telling big whoppers again.
It gives you an example how to fill it in and everything.
No it goes further on than that, I'm on tape three.
She's on tape two are n't you?
Cos I changed it over.
It's er Alice's granddaughter.
She ca n't half talk, she's only two and a half but aye and when she sets off that's it.
Yeah.
Well I got er Craigy on it today er but he do n't talk.
It's er er.
Stephen's mate.
He come to call for Stephen this morning so I collared him while I'd got him.
He's got er a video box of mine so I were him asking about it.
I got John in shop.
That's it.
If she's on, her name, that's on that, that means I've just started tape.
One before page.
If I'd've put your real age you'd've said.
Yeah.
What twenty plus sixty five?
Oh I'll put twenty one plus for you.
I'm not, that's cheating!
Alright then I'll put sixty four plus.
So are you gon na do it?
Are you gon na have a go?
Oh she's at it again.
Do you know she says she'll do it and then she says she wo n't.
She does that just to upset me do n't you?
Oh!
I know who you're on about.
I was just thinking who you were on about then.
Mrs.
What this week?
All day?
Well.
Cuckoo Lane?
Oh right up there.
I'm just thinking.
Yeah I know where you mean.
No kids?
That's it.
If there's no kids what's the point of.
Five to three?
Oh you've got babbies.
Mm.
Eh it is you know.
They charge you know that er bus stop at bottom of bridge?
I got on bus here and he charged me thirty five P!
Do n't forget, bus fares change.
Yeah.
Hey that's only one.
bus stop in between me and you.
There's only that bus stop and then it turns down you yet they charged me thirty five pence and that were n't even half past three.
That were in afternoon that.
So I bet that's thirty five to forty five, is it forty five after thirty five before, forty five after?
Cos they charged me twenty five on Little Nipper and it's cheaper on Little Nipper than bus.
But they did n't half charge.
Cos I nearly died I got on bus other day and they charged me eighty five pence I looked at me clock and it were twenty past nine.
Well that's beside the point.
That's beside the point.
Well that's it, I do n't blame you.
I do n't blame you at all.
I've been to Nettos this morning.
Alice took us.
So now Steve's got to take me to bank, mini bank, to get some money cos I've got none.
Er I got some tinned stuff sugar, sugar's fifty one.
Fifty one.

For twelve cakes it's thirty two, for twelve cakes.
Beans are seventeen, tomatoes are sixteen.

Trouble is they're that expensive.
People just keep buying the buggers.

Oh.
Yeah I got me coffee.

Yeah this one's called.
Mm.

That's the only trouble.
Did they?
Tt crafty bleeders are n't they?
Yeah cos when we went to Cleethorpes you were on about they were Fred's taties.
Cos I, I were asking if they wanted a baked tatie and that and we stood waiting for them and you noticed on sack.

Again?
Do you know they're supposed to only go up in budget these bloody things.

Yeah.
Down in this shop they're one eighty nine for a packet of cigs.
They started at one seventy seven after budget, cos what were they?
One seventy four were n't they?
No.
One seventy nine he put them up to.
Yeah one seventy nine he put them to, and then he put them up to one eighty two or summat and then they've gone up to one eighty nine I think they are.
They're trying to get them up to three pound a packet, that's what they're trying to do.
Yeah.
Innit?
I'm not paying three pound a packet.
They ca n't afford.
It's not fair.
Make you sick.
I've still got that irritation.
No she did it at doctors.
I got an eyelash stuck right inside fold, and I could n't er shift it for love nor money, it were there about two or three days before I went to doctors.
So he saw it, told nurse it were right in folds down there.
and to get it out.
And she got this ginormous magnifying glass and she nipped me face, just there.
You know that skin just underneath?
Well she had some they were like right slim at end and then went like that, and she got the fat bit and went crrrk and it hurts like mad.
Well she said she'd got it out but.
Tea bag.

It just irritates, it's not sore now, it irritates.
So I keep trying to get me eyelashes and push up.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Oh.
Mm.
Well I put me clothes out at twelve o'clock, I says to Linda if it holds out for a couple.
if it holds for a, well it's jeans, I thought well.
it'll get mainly dry and I can finish them off in here ca n't I?
Which is a lot better.
Have you been to that Nettos?
Have you been to that Nettos then?
Freezer's still empty.
They had some of them chickens in for one pound thirty odd, you know when it's got sign up on video?
Two pound eight ounces, that's all they were.
I thought no wonder they're one pound thirty odd!
See size only of them, little scrawny spoggies.
You may as well as go in garden and pick all these spoggies up, you'd get more meat on it.
And they'd got some funny things but they'd got foreign names and I thought well.
Well I know that but there is English names on a lot of stuff except certain stuff and then it's in foreign and it's.
Yeah.
It's not so bad if it's got picture, you know what's inside it then.
Oh aye yeah they'd make me buy it.
Eh you ca n't use a cheque, Access Card, nothing.
No, I had to borrow some money off Maggie this morning to pay me bill.
Cos I did n't quite have enough.
So I straight.
So you've got ta pay cash.
Well that's stupid having a ginormous supermarket.
Well they're all half price virtually are n't they?
Cos what's a loaf of bread, fifty eight innit?

It's all walking she does.
Up and down, up and down.
Yeah.

Yeah.
So I did it anyway cos later on you would have said well you could've taped me if you want like you always do so I did it anyway.
No, no I've got ta talk later, well I'll talk to you when I've switched that off, talk for about five minutes and I'll stick your voice on.

Mm yeah.
Is that the one, have I filled it in?
See I've got to remember, you see a few of them I had a load of them all talking, you know when I were at school?
So I just put mixed, school, male and female, mixed strangers.
so that'll cover for people that I do n't know.
I've lost me pen now.
Do you know I put that pen down and everything else and it disappears.
It's not yourn it mine.

The people to be interviewed.

You're telling fibs.
Oh right.
Oh put your order in.
Well you're sixty four, can I put sixty four?
Oh.
Can I just put four, plus four?
Twenty one plus sixty four?
So I'm allowed to put it now cos I've said it?
Well I told you did n't I?
Yeah.
I'm saying yeah I never looked at it, I automatically put it down.
Linda will you stop siding with her.
I know her thinking.
She says no you ca n't, I might do and then when she's ready to go out she'll say you could've taped it.
I done it.
Ooh.
You're not doing very well then are you?
What cabling?
It's easy.
You've put me off now, do you know what I'm putting in your age?
Thirty plus.
It is?
Thirty plus thirty four.
Get lost you.
if, if they add them if they add them together she's gon na stab me with screwdriver now cos I put that.
She's crossing it out, she do n't want her age, she's crossing thirty four out.
I bet she changes it to twenty one or summat.
Have you crossed thirty four out?
Right.
We'll say you're thirty plus then.
Okey-cokey, I'll see you later.
Yes.
So take care.
See you later duck, bye.
It sticks.
I'll turn it off for you now then.
Shall I turn it off?
Right.
that baby, she's only got seven weeks left.
Cos I says what you doing still working here, you know, that's what we'd just been on about.
cos she told us er Tommy said she had to pack jobs in.
and er apparently she's packed that cleaning job at.
cleaning job at oogie erm er ooh Samantha's been at me coat again.
she packed that cleaning job in at er, what do they call it?
Doctors.
she used to do at doctors or summat.
she packed that one in and she's packed the one in at, you know disabled school?
She packed that one in and she says she's still doing this for another two two week I think she says and that's erm what you call it?
That'll, she's got seven weeks to go so that'll leave her five.
But it's er leaving it a bit short notice innit?
Just for five weeks.
Cos I thought, I thought I'll take it out, I finished that tape, this is a new one.
So I put them two and a half up to press with this one and then I can turn it over and I'll be on to third side.
So ready and just.
I've just got ta.
Three!
When I put.
When I put three or four in my pan I ca n't get nowt in.
Are n't you doing none?
Will he?
What, take them out?
Weird!
Oh I'd've thought he would've done.
But then again they like all different things.
Er who's fetching thing home?
Oh she's coming by.
Did you notice she says she did n't have owt and she'd left it at home?
Anyway she went to shop she bought sweets and nappies.
Yeah I know I saw her.
Cos I shall go for it.
I shall go for it mesen tomorrow, you see I've got five pound in house which.
I'm giving you.
and that is the other two pound I owe you, leaving me three.
Cos I knew I'd got enough to give you back, that's why I wanted to borrow it.
and I thought bugger that I shall go over and get it mesen tomorrow.
No I mean if she do n't.
I shall be up for it tomorrow.
So I thought no, you're not getting away with that one.
No, definitely not.
She stated today.
And I thought.
She got her Family Allowance this morning as well.
So she's spent all that seventy odd quid?
It's a hell of a lot to spend in two days and the shops are shut on Sundays.
Oh good God!
No it's nearly finished.
That side of tape's nearly gone, a few more minutes and then it's finished I think.
Oh aye yeah, I ca n't sing.
Eh you should hear it with Irene I thought she were gon na stab me with screwdriver.
Taping her earlier and she ke it's cos I kept going to put sixty four on to tt you know that thing I fill in to say who's on it?
That I know.
who's on it?
And er she picked screwdriver up, well she thought it were a pen and I thought God she's got a screwdriver and she's gon na stab me and I put thirty plus thirty four.
and did it like that, so she scribbled thirty four out and left thirty plus.
I thought ooh dear me.
It were funny.
I thought it were funny anyway.
Have you been talking to him today?
Did he tell you if he's seen Stephen?
Oh.
I thought does n't this take a long time just for a little tiny bit?
Do you know it is, it's a little tiny but it's going on for ages and ages.
It's to stop me turning tape over I'm sure.
I think it said five six seven eight nine ten or summat on one side and then it said six seven eight nine on other side.
It sort of doubled up, or summat like that, so she crossed them all out and changed them.
Why?
There were two sixes and two nines.
and two eights and what have you.
Well she did n't do them.
Somebody else did.
She just picked boxes up and delivered them.
So it was like.
I do n't know.
Yeah.
I got Michael to finish filling other one up today.
Just talking about owt and nowt and.
No er when Maggie's talking, if she knows it's on she always tells me when to stop it.
Depends what she wants to say.
Same as you, only time when you did n't know what you thought and you've got to call everybody names and everything cos you do n't know what to say, you ca n't think of forgetting it's here.
No it is n't.
I know but we've got telly on and everything have n't we?
Oh I always turn telly off.
I do n't know.
I do n't know if it can pick voices up with telly on.
Well.
What them little hand held ones?
In office?
What, for abroad?
I thought you could only er do two hours?
I thought.
Yeah I know you do.
You've got a long way to travel.
Ooh.
Oh is he this new one you've?
Oh.
Why, has he already been told?
I know you've been told different people different things.
Mm yeah well I posted that one today for you.
Oh you got ashtray quick, I have n't even got!
I've got three.
Bought one what?
Oh no!
She falls for it l hook line and sinker.
Then I forget that I've been joking with her then she tells me off so I do n't bother any more.
She gets too serious.
She were on about Graham, she's seen him loads of times this week.
Last week.
Oh.
Waste of breath.
They're getting old.
But then again Irene and Fred's old and they're not like that.
They argue like hell them two now, Irene and Fred.
No.
He's done er erm tt what did she call it?
Summat like a takeover bid.
Now she's been having an argument with the council and while she's been arguing, you know she's got a grievance, while she's been arguing she takes her anger out on them and tells them what she thinks of them.
So since Fred's been retired, he says leave it to me and, because he's that soft, nothing's done about it.
And then she starts demanding to know what they're going to do and he keeps saying they're gon na write, they're gon na write, they're gon na write.
She says no they're not gon na write, I'm gon na phone them.
No do n't you phone them, I'll phone them, she says well phone them now.
So he'll phone her and she'll say and I'm still sat behind him rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, moan, moan, moan you see.
So er they says to him who's that?
He says it's me wife and she's as mad as hell, and they says yeah we can hear her from here and s must've said summat about writing and she starts bawling and shouting, oh summat about you've got to write I want a letter by Friday, you're not messing me about no more, you're not talking to him you're talking to me.
And then she ran upstairs and grabbed the other phone and Fred had to put phone down cos she would n't shut up.
So you see they were having a difference of opinion over that and he's saying you should n't, you should've left it all to me and she says I've done it for last fifty year and, you know, all this.
And she says you're stupid, you do n't know how to talk to them and then they start, you see Fred wo n't row.
And same as she says, she needs a row to clear the air, so picks on him and he just ducks.
Well I went in and I says where's me cup?
And Fred said see, I told you you'd got to tell her.
I took off.
I says where's me cup?
She says I threw it at him.
That's what I says, that went an'all apparently.
That went an'all.
Cos I'd been there that morning.
and er my cup were out, her cup, Ev's cup and Fred's cup.
Aye, she were washing them or summat and he were annoying her so she threw them all.
And she phoned me up and says what are you doing?
I says nowt, she says good I'm coming.
Every time she gets arsey now she comes down here.
I thought she were gon na stab me with screwdriver today.
Yours on table.
Thought bloody hell.
Tormenting you know how she torments, says yeah you can do it then you ca n't, then you can, then you ca n't?
Well when she come in I asked her if we could tape so she says yeah course you can.
Then she decided to be awkward, like she always is, and said I says oh it's still taping you know and I s she said summat, I ca n't remember what it were now but I was saying, I knew that'd happen, one minute yes then no, then I'll think about it, I says and if I did n't start it when you went out you'd be saying you could've done this and that and er so she were chittering, pretending she said I could n't do it.
She said I could and then she were messing about you see.
And then I went and showed her all forms, all these form things that they've got I were letting her read it.
And.
These that are in this bag.
And.
Have n't you seen them?
That's what I've got.
Oh well, you know.
It's not under your nose!
do n't tell lies.
Anyway er it were what you write down, you're supposed to write who you've been talking to, tt what the occupation is er you, how old they are, female, male regional accent and that's, if you were born in London that's your accent you're using int it?
Oh well I do n't know.
Aye all that jazz, and er.
Well if I know who they are and I do n't know where they come from I'll just put who they are day I were talking to them and dash it.
I ca n't fill all answers in I only.
I only fill them in that I know for a fact.
Cos sometimes they wo n't tell you.
Yeah she filled.
about ten in.
Yeah.
I were telling you about Irene, I were filling this thing in and I put right, sixty four I were gon na put sixty four, that were it.
So she did n't want sixty four putting down, she wanted twenty one plus putting down.
So what I did is I writ thirty plus thirty four, adding up to sixty four and she jumped up and she's grabbing thing off table and she had hold of the screwdriver and I says to Linda thought she was gon na stab me with screwdriver and she were n't, she were looking for a pencil so she could rub it out, well she could n't and she found this pencil and she scribbled thirty four out.
So it says thirty plus now even though she's sixty four.
Yeah that's exactly what she did.
I could n't stop laughing.
Linda were going in hysterics.
Nowt much, just fetched her club money up, had a pratt about all about family and that, different things.
Cos I thought oh dear.
Have you left it, wh what did you actually do?
Yeah.
Made it slippery.
Mm yeah well you would.
Straight on your leg again.
Your knee?
Oh.
Mm.
How come they can take time off yet you ca n't?
Oh.
Well I do n't get that, me.

Oh so you should've got them for January?
Yeah.

That's a fella's knock.
You can tell.
Oh thank you very much.
Goodbye.
It is a bit.
Ta-ta.
Do n't look like we're watching we're watching this.
I says if they lent me it erm well they might want us to watch it now and lend it to someone else.
Naked Gun Two And A Half.
so she says they were getting it but were n't watching it till eight.
And I says oh Steve ca n't watch it at eight.
Er ca n't watch it after you've watched it at eight, I'm getting right odd here.
but she must've told him.
Nowt.
heck.
They are, they put a pound each.
She's ca n't be, she had two ten pound notes in her purse this morning.
See I can tell knocks.
Knocks.
Whether it's a fella or a woman.
Fellas always do a fancy knock.
We just bang on door.
Oh er telly's got a buzz on it and I could n't get it off, I think I made it worse.
Cos I pressed colour by accident and.
Well it's stupid that telly.
It is, it's got that many buttons on it I ca n't find which is which.
Well they've only got little tiny bits of writing on.
No I've done it now.
Well you ca n't use that for a buzz, you use that for a buzz do n't you? for a buzz?
Rubbish.
All of them.
If you turn sound off you can hear buzz.
But then again it could be that.
I know it just dawned on me.
I just looked down, I seen it then and ah nelly.
I'm going senile before me time, it's Irene.
Do you know one minute they're alright daft as a brush, and next minute they ca n't get on with er other people.

Were it Irene or Maggie?
We were on about Saturdays, having Saturdays to oursen finally you know, instead of having to go here there and everywhere not bothered about afternoon, I meant night times and that.

So I'm er I've got Durham, Scottish er me grandparents come from Lee Lancs.
Yeah, me mum always said Lee Lancs.
Or was she born in Lee Lancs?
Anyway they were born one place and moved one place and then they come to after I were born.
I.

Yeah I just write where you were born, where your cos it says regional accent, I'm assuming that means.
I just put London.
It's easier.
It's like your Billy he.
No.
It says regional accent, well he's Yorkshire int he?
He's a Chinese what?
Ah it's, I've got one to fill in, I must remember, Nadine's.
She's Turkish yeah, they come to London.
Cos the accent she's got is London.
Yeah.
Yeah but there's different parts of London, you all sound different do n't you?
Cos do n't forget there's people who's moved from Donny and had their kids in London.
and they sound different.
Well he were born in Hong Kong were n't he?
He were talking.
Ah there she is.
Nadine.
There's a bit on bottom please write their first name are there any people mentioned above who's first language is not English and that's Nadine.
cos she talks both.
Yeah.
I've heard her talking to her dad.
And I s that's when I says to her where do you come from?
She says me dad's Turkish.
How do you spell Turkish?
You missed summat.
T U R K.
I missed I again, I tell you I'm rubbish at spelling, me.
Mm they originate from Turkey and then they moved to London.
What is it?
I've heard about that before.
I like making me own coffee, at least I know I can drink it.
Yeah.
I'm hoping that washing dries.
It's going in again, it saw me put socks out.
Do you know it's never failed me yet, I put socks out.
and it always ends up going right, so they do n't dry, right funny so it do n't d or it rains.
That's why I thought I'll get the stupid things out this morning and then them, they'll all be dried by tomorrow.
I ca n't remember if I've been in bathroom and picked them up, Steve's getting a sod with him getting bath every night.
he's er just dropping them.
Oh yeah.
Well how long how long's he going, for a week or a fortnight?
Fortnight?
When's he go, May?
Comes back in June?
No?
End of May, beginning of June.
I've got summat for your Gary.
No, oh no.
Erm he bought that car off Steven did n't he?
I found instructions.
And I think, I know where they are, I think they're on bed.
Cos I got them out and I thought I must take them downstairs and give them to Maggie for her to give them to Gary.
twisted round then gon na say something.
Thought while I'm thinking about it I'll do it.
Just saying I'm a stupid bugger.
I checked Steven's bedroom for washing.
round, I've, I have checked bathroom, I took it out of bathroom and guess what, I did n't check?
Our bedroom.
That's on pile in bedroom.
I thought ooh!
Are n't I.
Yeah that belongs to that car.
He's saving it for his kids, that's what he says.
Or he'll end up giving it away as a present, there's nowt wrong with box, car, nothing.
Well that's it.
Your Gary's happy as he is, he's enjoying life.
That's the mistake Steven's made girlfriends.
Knowing he ca n't afford them with him being in college.
and then he's just gone mad, I think they've gone to his head.
Did I tell you they call him Juan now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah that's true.
I'm wondering what that thing is on Maureen's wall, have you seen it?
It looks it flaps about, if you look at Maureen's wall near drainpipe you can see this thing.
flapping all over.
I keep meaning to.
You know drainpipe.
you've got that little window, then drainpipe?
At side of drainpipe.
You can see it flapping about, you watch in a sec it starts flapping.
Can you see it?
I do n't know.
I keep meaning to.
see if it's a vent or summat or a piece of plastic.
They've put it in the sun whatever it is.
Unless it's that cooker thing, I think her cooker's there.
She's got one of them oogies them erm tt fan things.
That's it.
She's got one of them.
Mm and that's about right place where it is, I wonder if it's that.
Yeah they're nice are n't they?
I did n't like them when she first put them up.
but they're alright now.
Flo's trying to con me.
She wants me rails, these metal rails that I've got.
Yeah.
She wanted them so I says to her if she wanted them.
I was after wooden ones.
now I says, now I've seen some wooden ones in her house, I said.
if she wants to swap I'll swap her.
The crafty bugger says to me, what did she say, they're fourteen pound summat I think she says, these wooden ones.
and er I says well I thought you'd got some.
Now.
I'm sure I've seen one in her house.
and she says no, she says one I've got's only a thin one, you want that thicker one, you know with these being thick.
she says so I thought if I buy you one she says you give me them two, I says whoa hang on a minute, I says I've got two windows.
not one window, I says I'm not giving you two for one.
I says and at that price why do n't you buy them yourself.
you know?
And she says well I thought if I buy you one you can buy other one, I says go and naff off.
I says I do n't, I says when am I gon na be able to go to town I says and afford fifteen quid for another bloody rail?
I says you.
Yeah!
She wants me to take them down and swap them for one.
Steve'll go mad.
I thought you crafty sod.
She wants them to extend to eight feet, well these do n't extend to eight feet, they extend to seven.
And I thought no I'm not, Steve's just cleaned them up.
He spent about two hours in with them.
Have you seen what he's done to ends of them, they've gone silvery, he's rubbed and rubbed and rubbed.
and he's rubbed all colour off it.
They've got silver ends on them ones.
I said.
I says ca n't you rub harder on other piece.
He's done these ones.
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off.
on ends, so he took the two ends off, cleaned the rails and he was sat on settee watching telly rubbing away and rubbing away and I says hey you gon na put them ends back on?
And he'd been rubbing for that long they'd gone that colour.
I remember.
He scrubbed and scrubbed till it all come off did n't he?
How old were he then, about thirteen?
I can remember that, he come over and told me.
Not now.
I want a new frying pan.
I keep using me best pan.
Have you?
You know when we saved them Berkeley packets?
Can you remember what we saved them for?
Marion asked me other day what we were saving them for, I said well we saved them oh I remember!
We saved them, they were on about cameras and that and then we found out inserts inside it that you got it with that did n't you?
Yeah.
I've still got stacks of them in kitchen.
She got one.
You know like we got?
Regal.
You know them that we got to send off for that, I got head bag and you got that?
Well I s I were saying to Irene, I says did you ever get one?
She says yeah I'm sure we did.
I says well if you do n't smoke them I says me and Maggie'll get them for you.
I says she'll get Gary to collect them at work and that I says.
and I'll ask you know.
Dave and them to save for me again.
I says and get yoursen summat.
Anyway er she rooted about in drawers yesterday and er.
she found this booklet and it were like a cheque book.
it's got the picture on but it's a cheque.
please send me one blah blah whatever it is.
Anyway I were looking and I looked and I looked and I looked and I says well what cigarettes do you use for it?
Cos it did n't but same.
all prizes were the same but it did n't.
Bloody cigar packets.
I said ooh we ca n't help you with them, I says I have n't the faintest idea of anybody that smokes them.
Cos she says do n't you?
I says no I says I do n't know anybody at all.
So I could n't help her there at all.
Do you just keep collecting it?
Would n't bother.
I banged my finger on.
Did n't half hurt.
Thought bloody hell.
It's a bus.
A bus.

Oh, she.
Did he?
Chuffing hell.
His speech is getting a lot better.
I thought that were that Brian now.
I do n't know.
Ca n't see where they've gone.
Oh it looks like him.
He's looking at your house.
He's looking at your house.
Or is he looking at the bus?
He's looking at the bus.
He walked up here, walked to your house, looked at the bus I do n't know where'd he come from.
And do you know that's only trouble with these nets.
He has he's just parked car, walked up here, looked at bus and walked back again.
No, this one's driving a car.
He were looking at that bus.
Yeah, well it's, they've done nowt but look at it for last three month.
I like his registration.
Well he parked car there.
walked up there right to your house, eyed bus up and then walked back again.
Your Bill nearly hit it other week he were telling me.
I should imagine they are from the council.
That was only a oner.
It sounded better.
And it wo n't?
Mm.
I like leg.
I like leg.
Yeah.
I'm just debating whether to run in that kitchen and put that kettle on again, what do you reckon?
That's alright then.
I'm not going in cupboard.
everything's on top.
I'm gon na have to go and get some more milk.
Yeah, I'll nip this afternoon and get some.
Normally I er put a banana and a strawberry together to give it a different taste.
Oh yeah, pocket money.
Yeah.
I know you do, that's next week's.
Yeah that's next week.
Yeah I put it in me pocket last night and I thought right I'll give her her two P and I bet your life she says what about other one.
So she's got loads.
She left twelve pence on floor and what?
Well there are.
Twelve P.
What's sh what's Billy do, take her to shop?
Yeah.
That's what I says to.
does he do that on the way out?
Ooh.
Not far to go.
Have to change tape.
It'll have more coughs and splutters and er traffic and everything on this side.
Well it's bound to be hot I've just made it.
I'm alright doing it in pencil.
Oh I do n't know.
I've got ta ring anyway, nine sixteen.
twenties thirties, forties.
No Irene's the eldest the crafty bleeder.
That's what I'm looking for, I'm hoping she's rubbed it out in pencil.
She scribbled it out.
She does n't, she did n't mind taping or owt, she were pretending that.
she said cos she were talking, she knew tape were still running and she were pretending to say that she did n't say I could do it but she did.
erm what she were arguing with me about is her age.
Now she's sixty four.
so she did n't want me to put sixty four down, but that's cheating.
cos if you know the age you're supposed to put the age down.
cos some people'll tell you and some people wo n't.
So I put sixty four down so well I did n't put sixty four, I put thirty plus thirty four.
so that made sixty four.
So she jumped up, grabbed the pencil and everything, she got a screwdriver first, I thought she were gon na stab me with screwdriver and she were looking for a pencil.
erm but luckily she's rubbed it out with thingy so.
I'm putting it back in.

So there.
Now it's back again, it says thirty plus thirty four.
She wanted me to put twenty one!
I says get lost, I says that's cheating.
I put your age in.
Forty seven.
It's a good job I put forty two then innit?
Have you already turned forty three?
I thought you were forty well it were your birthday in September were n't it?
You're forty four this year?
Fifty, that's three year.
Sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, that's forty three forty four this year.
If your birthday er I keep getting mixed up, it's your anniversary in February and it's your birthday in September.
So I'll have to change yours to forty three, I put forty two.
I forgot you've already had your birthday.
Oh I'll just put a plus sign at it.
I can try hard ca n't I?
Plus one.
No I'll leave it at forty two.
I'm, got you only had your birthday three month ago.
Or somewhere around there.
I'm thinking it's your birthday tomorrow, and it's not it's your anniversary tomorrow.
September eighth.
And February the sixth.
Yeah.
So you'll have a right good anniversary tomorrow cos nobody'll be in.
Yeah more than likely.
I had a good anniversary.
Well I kept me own present, I stayed in bed half a day did n't I?
You swore on my machine.
No.
It were goo that's good compared to some of them.
I says to her when she were leaving it, I says to her there's people that swear and that.
She says it do n't matter.
And there's Fs and there's Bs.
It's Linda that Fs and Bs'd.
Steve swore.
Er and there's somebody else somebody else swearing.
Oh no it's not bad, I think it were er the first swear word I remember that went, went on it were wait a minute tape two, tape one ai n't got none on that I know of.
Tape two has tape three has.
Tape two and tape three.
And this is tape four int it?
There's a lot of people wo n't let you do it.
No.
I think they think you've got to have a conversation where you.
talk about all what you talk about.
but I do n't, I stop it when you get there.
If they do n't want.
Yeah.
So I do n't.
I'd've filled all twenty up now if they'd've all let me.
But you ca n't be doing that can you?
If they got five tapes off everybody by the Christ they'll have some listening to do wo n't they?
Cos what's four tapes?
When I've finished this one I'll have one side left.
ninety minutes a tape, that's an.
hour and half, that's three, that's six hours.
Well I taped six hours.
Ninety minutes a tape, that makes six.
Do you know what I've just noticed?
Cough.
Er watch that light, cough.
I were watching it, every time you cough it starts flashing.
Dinky!
Steve keeps saying he were he says I'm having that tape recorder, I says you're not she's coming to take it back.
I'm gon na tell her I'm having that tape recorder, I says you're not, she's coming back for it on Friday.
I know, we've got that one.
We've got four Walkmans in here like it, there's one at top there, I think that's same as this one.
That one's a radio thingy, the one Steven's got's a, a radio thingy, this one is n't.
But what he likes about it is microphone.
That's what my brother's son did to his father.
I paid fi fifteen bleeding quid for that and I sai cos this year, I did n't know he'd done this cos he sits it like that.
or clips it like that and you ca n't tell.
anyway he give it to his father and, well I'd already bought the other one I'd.
cos I says if he looks after it I'll buy him one with radio on as well.
so I just paid that one with radio.
But I wish he'd stop nicking my bleeding torch, he's getting a swine for that.
I only got it back, you know when I got it back?
No when batteries are dead.
I get all me torches back when battery's dead.
I got one with a big chunky battery, it should've lasted about six month to a year.
a right good'un it were, our Arthur give me torch and I had to buy a battery, I paid about three pound odd for this battery.
He did.
You've got it.
Exactly.
It'll be zip on his erm tracksuit.
I found jacket, did I tell you?
I got jacket and bottom.
And some underwear.
I ca n't stick that.
I ca n't stick it.
Ooh no.
I got your Billy yesterday and I says oh do us a favour I says will you say owt, anything, just.
tell us about breathing, no you're not getting my voice on that thing he says, I, I do n't like hearing me voice and everything, and he threw it on the settee.
Oh we had a right laugh about it.
Could n't stop laughing.
Me and your mam did one this morning, I had about twenty minutes left on it and she helped me finish it off.
so I could swap tapes over.
Yeah.
I do n't know.
Yeah, yeah and all that, bloody hell.
What have you been doing?
Have you been to your mam's?
The crafty get, she did n't give me one.
I've been over and she did n't give me one.
Yet she comes in here and eats me cakes and biscuits.
She had toast and tea this morning.
I stood in kitchen and I smothered this slice of toast and butter were just literally running off it and it were.
all soggy and floppy.
but we had to do that with her having a sore throat.
God.
I know, Steven's nicked all polish.
and I had another one, you know one of them with sponges on?
And he snapped sponge off end.
sat and got going like that.
Could n't stop laughing.
What's J J doing anyway?
Gone to her mam's?
Yeah.

That's your special one?
Good God.
Ah.

Did she get it?
She'll have no money by then.
When's baby due?
Ah.
Shame you could n't have it for your birthday.
You're having your watch?
Oh.
Sixty pound for a year!
Bloody hell!
Stephen's last him about six week.
If it starts going funny he takes the back off to have a look, no matter how much you pay for it.
He dismantles the lot, he's stupid.
I've got more straps and bloody cordless watches, everything, all over the place.
Cos Wayne give him one, he paid seventy quid for it and he dismantled that one in three week of having it.
Yeah it's in cupboard.
in cupboard.
My beloved's been in this cupboard and messed it all up.
I've got Sarah coming down this afternoon.
Yeah she slept in for work again.
She's gon na get sack her by time she's finished.
She's more at home than she is at work.
Did I tell you she got her inheritance?
Yeah she twenty one other week and.
Four and a half thousand.
Yeah.
She's chuffed to death.
Only thing she were n't chuffed about is she could n't cash cheque, it had to go all through bank and everything.
Oh you got her mine.
I were looking at that one.
so I can take that middle'un off and get it to match.
That's what I were gon na do.
It's nice that.
Thirty.
Twenty nine ninety nine.
Is it real gold?
Nine carat gold.
Diamond set.
Good God.
Half eternity.
One two three three of one, four of other.
Oh it's nice that.
If it says diamonds they're real.
It's only cos they're chips.
diamond chips, they'll be little tiny ones.
smack in middle are they?
Yeah I thought they are er smaller than that.
Ah there they are, there.
That's a diamond and sapphire just a bit bigger than yours.

It's nice that,.
There it is, I think that's it, twenty six, twenty six, twenty six, twenty si yeah that's it.
See that?
That's erm erm er er Sarah's engagement ring.
Yeah she got engaged.
Could n't remember if I told you.
Cos I says thirty odd quid, she says yeah they're on special.
cos they're knock-down prices are n't they?
And er she says that she did n't want summat expensive when she could be buying summat for kitchen, you know, like a microwave or summat like that.
So I do n't blame her really.
I've buggered me alarm clock up.
I got mad because.
it would n't set so I hit it and you know buttons?
I went like that on top and I said bloody work!
And all buttons went inside.
Steve looked at it, he said I think you'd better go to shop and buy yoursen a new one.
I do n't know.
Sometimes they've got some in that book, they're in them leaflets.
Like Steve's.
Yeah.
It might be on one of them leaflet things, you know they make the leaflets?
Might be on that.
But they've got some nice things in there.
I were looking for an alarm clock, I thought I better have a new one else I'm gon na start sleeping in for work.
But they're usually cheap in here but I want one that.
plays music, I ca n't hear an alarm clock.
It's got to.
Yeah.
Otherwise I ca n't get up.
Cos Steve always had to wake me up for work.
and er then he decided to buy me a radio alarm for Christmas.
And it worked, I've heard it ever since till I hit it.
Have n't you done owt like this, things like this?
Ca n't you have them sort of thing?
?
Did you?
Oh cos ai n't you got one summat like this?
Did n't she have a two ring burner or summat like that?
She got rid of it?
Ah.
I thought you were n't supposed to have one of them?
But you can have microwave?
Ca n't you have a deep fat fryer and things like that?
Oh.
Oh that's not a fire hazard, you can have it?
They're cheaper in here I know.
Mm.
My.
Ah.
so you can have microwaves, toaster, kettle.
and things like that and that's about it.
Oh I were just wondering.
Ca n't find clocks.
Ca n't find bugger all.
Oh so they'll be round here somewhere then wo n't they?
I just wondered how much they are cos that one that er just disintegrated on me, I got it from Britannia.
It's rubbish.
It's never worked proper.
it sort of played about two or three minutes of music and then it went crrrkkkkkk for a few minutes, that's why I kept hitting it.
And then music, if you hit it, music come back on.
Stupid it were.
Have to have a proper look later, I ca n't find it.
Ah found one.
I says I ca n't find them, I found them.
Here we are.
what's that one, number four, number four digital clock, mains operated, fast time, alarm set, snooze feature, battery back-up four ninety five.
That's not bad at all that.
Seven ninety nine.
Six ninety five.
Six ninety five and a six fifty.
Look.
I might have that little'un.
You can stick batteries in it, I prefer them with batteries.
At least if battery goes out.
Yeah if electric goes off.
That was supposed to be battery back-up system, the one I threw on floor.
Cos I dismantled it and threw it on floor.
Tt I got right mad.
It's a good job I've got two.
So I shall have one of them I think.
Yeah.
There you are.
I'll turn this tape off now, let you listen to yoursen.
I'll have this one Ted.
Looks a good'un, futuristic one.
Steve likes them.
Yeah please.
I've got, I, I had a rough idea of what he'd got and what he had n't now.
I'm getting there.
I'm doing well so far, I have n't fetched one back have I?
That must be good.
See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?
That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself.
Ah we will do later cos.
he uses cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
tight innit?
Yeah.
Aye well that does n't bother us.
Ta-ta.
shorts and so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash.
So, thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing.
So that's what I did.
Now what we're on about yeah as I were on about, that er what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee if they're gon na be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it do n't they're virtually dry when I fetch them in.
So that's what I've been doing.
I do n't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
So, how come you managed to sleep in again?
You were up?
You did n't?
Yeah.
So you thought nah I'm not going, I'm stopping at home.
Third time that's been in the washer since Christmas day.
And that's only cos last twice I've thinked of it.
I have n't the foggiest idea.
I do n't keep track any more, I let him get on with it.
It's easier.
How come Dave's home?
How come Dave's home?
I thought you says he were working on them mate's car?
Mate's car.
Oh.
Ah well that's not too bad.
It keeps him from getting bored.
Dunnit?
Socks.
Oh I'm doing well, I've got one odd sock so far.
Brill.
Stephen.
Oh he's gone back to J J.
I told you he went back to J J did I?
Oh aye it do n't bother me.
I give up on them.
I give up on them all.
I sent him to doctors.
He come in, his eye's right out here, and it's streaming with water and he says he's been to hospital, they dripped some water in it, washed it out must be mine that, what do you reckon?
Oh.
I can never tell cos he pinches them all.
If it's a T- shirt it's his.
So he says.
Anyway it was streaming with water so er I told him to get down to doctors, he asked if, that's why I said oh Stephen's been back.
It must've been while I was stood up there.
And he's er what you called it?
Er went to nurse so I lent him bike.
Well mine's got a visor and everything on it.
One of them comes right down there.
So Just airing these off.
That's what they're like when I fetch them in, it's not bad is it?
So I just air them off.
What you been doing all day?
On knock?
Not a thing?
Not gobbing, nowt?
You're having a right lazy day?
Bet you get fed up with that job do n't you?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

Is she a supervisor a chargehand or summat?
At that age?
No I bet you do n't, I would n't neither.
Cor.
Are you in mucky end or other end?
In between?
Well that says a right lot that does.
All I know there's a mucky end and another end.

Oh well that's not bad.
They'll say every time she's on days she does n't turn up.
Have you rung up already?
Tt.
What you tell them?
Slept in?
Tt.
You'll have to remember what you've used.
Your grandma's dead four times.
Poor old grandma.
No.
Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
I tell you summat I'm getting fed up because every time I do n't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I do n't feel well, I do n't want to.
It was an arrangement we had I, I would n't phone in cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages if I phone in.
So I says I would n't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I do n't mind, you know, losing a day's pay.
I said I'll pay you mysen.
So er she says yeah fair enough then she wo n't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I do n't have to wait three weeks for mine so next time I do n't feel great I'm gon na call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years.
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I ca n't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So.
they've not, yeah, they've not phoned her up for God knows how long.
Irene's been doing it.
Cos Irene says give me a ring I says no, I says that's it, I said I've already made the arrangement once and it backfired I says so I'm not doing it no more.
I says when I'm not feeling well or slept in I says I'm gon na phone police station, I'm gon na go from there, see what they say.
Let them find somebody.
I says I'm not messing about no more.
Do you know everybody's had flu and God knows what and I ca n't catch it.
I had that at Christmas which made me bad all over Christmas right?
And everybody, I says marvellous cos I can have some time off,, it's not fair.
I'm not having that, that's cheating.
If they can have some time off I can have some time off, fair's fair.
It dries right quick, it just takes that chill off.
I ai n't done nowt.
No she has n't seen that one.
It must be on back.
It might be on that one you had upstairs.
Yeah.
We try hard.
I hear you're going on holiday with your mum and dad?

He never talks when he reads.
Why are you going on holiday and leaving Sarah behind?
How come it's her idea?
So you've got to go?
Tt.
Is n't it awful?
If she gets up.
Oh aye you said you did did n't you?

You smoke too much, do you want a cig?
I'll be kind to you.
Oops.
You're a sado-masochist you.

Oh.
I thought your mum were older than your dad.
What time does she go to work?
Bloody hell that's a long day.
Ooh how's she gon na get there?
Can she drive?
Oh I thought she went on bus.

Er yo your car she's using then?
Oh you've got a car and a pick-up?
And a bike?

Why's she want a Volvo, it's ginormous!
Can you?
Oh.

Have you got a little red light?
Yeah.
I thought you were a mechanic.
Well get rid of your little red light then!
I've done it now.
What, to get rid of a little red light?
Well I would do, I'd walk back for, me.

Oh I could n't walk through a wood on a night time.
No way.
Dead?
Eh?
Well no wonder you were chucking bricks at him, I would have done an'all.
Did n't you think he were dead?
When you first found him?
What did he do?
You'd've been alright if it'd've been a mass murderer slept for years.
You never that one again.
If you'd've known then what you knew after you wouldn't've thought it were funny, you'd've not been chucking nowt you'd've been off.
Bloody hell.
Did they get him?
He should of bloody stayed.
He tells fibs an'all.
Are you on a diet?
Did I tell you Steve's car conked out last week, again?
Yeah.
Points.
Yeah he had to put new points in.
Last night he had to put new plugs in, they were brand new before he crashed it were n't they?
Could've been.
They refused point blank and he had to take it to another garage.
Yeah.
No i I phoned insurance up and told them what they'd said, cos I got Maggie to phone, it were Maggie that said, they told Maggie that they were gon na put a second hand wheel on and everything instead of a brand new one so she told insurance about it.
They went mad, they told us that we'd got to take it to National Tyres, took it there, twenty three pound fifty it cost us.
Tracking and balancing it, none of it were done.
They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice, we took it in to insurance and they're gon na write a cheque, deduct it off that thing.
and send us the cheque back.
Cos they should've done it.
Yeah.
That twenty three pound odd what we had to pay, they said we should pay nothing.
Anything to do with the crash, we do n't pay nothing for it.
So everything that we've got to pay out we invoice them.
they deduct it and send us it.
And that's what we've been doing.
So it were n't bad, especially the money back.
You what?
It's their own fault.
They should've made arrangements, we phoned up, asked them if we could take it in.
That were on Tuesday we phoned up.
What's the matter?

She only lives in Hatfield.
And her that, I were watching, that hit her you'll never guess what she did?
She must've left her statement, walked over to her car and she checked the car before she checked the four kids.
I were watching her do it.
I thought bloody hell you'd check your kids first.
Maggie only stopped about an hour this morning, she's not feeling well.
She has n't got rid of it.
Bill told her to stop in bed this morning and he'd w he'd get her up when he come in at two o'clock this afternoon.
She would n't.
Only she's coughing that bad it's keeping him awake.
And that's why he says to sleep and then if she could n't get to sleep she could like sit up tonight so he could get some sleep instead.
Fair enough not stop in bed but er stay in house, light fire and stay in.

I took that one back.
It'd, I'd got this weird line on it one eighty nine I got this weird on it.

so I er what you call it, I took it back and I says er there's summat wrong with this one, I says it's got a line or whatever it is, I says I ca n't get it off.
So he says oh well fair enough then.
He says just put it over there he says and get yoursen another one so I picked that one up.

It's there.
I got that one.
He says sometimes they do get rogue tapes or summat.

Apparently Alice had told her that I were going to town with them.

But that were nowt to do with it twenty four hours later.
It should've been first thing in morning if that would happen.
Yeah it were after I'd had summat to eat.

So she says no so I says so I'll.
He went about twenty to nine.
I heard kettle and I thought he's still in house, him.
Which normally he's took off.
Anyway he come up he says there's a cup of coffee there for you mum, and walked out.

So I thought.
Oh you should've heard him other day, all Parker pens that are in this house are his he says.
and that pen that he broke were n't mine it were his.
I says oh yeah, I says have you got the rest of them with it like?
And he says oh no, I says no I says it's a full set so keep your bleeding hands off, he says well all rest in house are mine.

Reason they're mixed up he, he must've been in there messing about with them.
It's there, what it is it's on these pages.
like this one that's playing now is side.
A on number six tape.
but I've just took number five out and put it back in box, cos it tells you number five, number three.

It's just that Stephen's been rooting about in boxes.
He's been nosy.
He were that nosey he's nicked all pens, everything.
I have n't got a pen!
I've been filling it in.
I've been filling it in in pencil.
So I do n't usually fill it straight away anyway till I'm finished and but I always put the date like today's date.
No, ca n't even see a pencil.
He's got an answer from that sugar place.
Did I tell you Steve.

Oh well i somewhere ne I thought it were Scunthorpe but it's not Scunthorpe it's Newark it's up.
And er it's summat sugar, I do n't know what it is but it's electrician's job and he asked me to post that, when did I post that?
Were it Monday?
Did I post all them letters on Monday?
Oh I know I've started accumulating again.
I always do, I always get about three or four letters and then end up posting them.
It's cos I ca n't be arsed to go for one stamp.
That's all it is.
I know there's two up there but one's free.
Do you?
Oh it's summat about erm yeah it is you know erm where you vote for them union things I meant to ask you if they'd got a stamp.
I got a letter from my er phantom writer.
sent this home yesterday.
and it goes apple pies or, great big line, wrapped round I think it's bread pudding.
Yeah apple pie or and a circle round bread pudding.
I says he gets bleeding worse him.
Please, it says please.
Yeah.

Oh it's give you breakfast for fourteen days.
It's yesterday's.
Yeah.
Yeah I know, I've got to get numbers as well, I ai n't done them yet.
I'll do them when you're erm cos I meant to do them and I forgot all about it.
He's you know not talking to me now.
He no it's summat entirely different, cos I says he were being sarcastic and keep your mouth shut if you ca n't speak normal.
What was it?
We watched that last night do n't matter we watched that last night and he were chittering away about summat, I were n't taking a lot of notice.
and then it finished and he always turns video off but he never turns telly off, so I turned the telly off.
and he says you're not telling me you're coming to bed are you? says well.
that's what you normally do on a night time, he says oh so you're not sleeping on settee?
I says if you ca n't think of nowt better to say just shut your mouth.
He says it every time I fall asleep on settee.
Every time.
Well I says to him, I says if you were that interested I says while I'm watching I says why do n't you come and see, I says, give us a shake.
but he never does.
And I thought no, I'm not playing.
So he would n't give me a kiss and he would n't say goodnight so I thought nah I'm not bothered.
He were tired anyway, minute his head hit pillow he started chuffing snoring.
Him and that snoring, it's driving me nuts.
I s.
I snore when I get a cold.
And I'm getting it.
Can you tell?
Slowly, but I'm getting it.
You've like half cleared?
Mm.
I were telling you about that sugar place, we're doing it again.
Erm I only posted it, I'm sure I posted it Monday.
cos he filled it in at weekend and I posted it Monday or Tuesday, one of them two.
Anyway er he's got a reply this morning.
I do n't know.
I've got to wait till half past seven tonight.
No I have n't I've got to wait till half past five, it's Friday int it?
He got two six one this week.

Saturdays and that.
Aye.
Well have you been reading in paper, what were I reading?
Nicked nicked a full street.
No a street.
Erm Steve fetched Star as well yesterday.
and I'm sure it said they'd nicked a full street in this one.
That Sun is getting ridiculous.
They get their teeth into summat and they do about ten pages on it.
So, and I'm sure it's this one, they nicked a street.
You know you park?
They nicked a full pavement.
I were reading.
Yeah.
I do n't know if it's erm tt a con cos it seems a bit unbelievable, nicking a street.
Yeah.
But they do n't.
Cos it's all about Paddy Ashdown int it?
I picked it up, I says to Steve who's Paddy Ashdown?
He says you and your politics, I says that's right, me and my politics I says I do n't think a lot of notice of them, me.
It do n't matter what you read about, what you say, they're gon na do what they want anyway.
Yeah there's about just a minute.
Too much?
You're not kidding er page nine so far.
Nine pages of same person.
Surely to God they can find summat better to write about?
Like this woman who's won two million, eighty odd er how old is she?
Sixty two.
She's comfy for life now, she can afford a operation on her hip.
Where is it?
Do you know it annoys me, I know I've read it.
They nicked whole street, and I only read it last night.
It annoys me when I ca n't find it.
What, your cough or your run?
Mm.
I ca n't find it.
and then you can have it.
I'll find it.
I'll do what I usually do.
Ah there's pencil!
We have a pencil!
Makes a bloody change.
No.
No cards neither by looks of it.
No.
I want Saturday paper, I get that on time anyway so it do n't matter.
If I ever won.
If.
I'd er oh I've got one out of pool numbers.
Wow.
There's quite a few actually.
Two, four, six, eight, ten, eleven.
I've got two and it's Friday today.
It's summat to do.
Do you know I've had a blue pen, I've had a black pen and now I'm down to a bloody pencil.
Oh you'll not find a crayon in this house.
Everything, if it writes it's his for college.
Cos that's what he'll a done gone out and then come and pinched.
It's not bad but he do n't use them till they've run out he just uses them and leaves them laying about and come and takes some more.
I had a tin full of them.
Did he?
Oh.
I could n't get them any closer.
I've done it again.
Yeah you know what I've done, it's that er thing there well before I had it I used to put them on floor at side of ashtray, and now I leave it on settee and you know when I put me legs up, you know when you move over and watching telly?
You end up sitting on it.
And I'm sure that's what's doing it.
It's about five I've done in in two days.
And I ca n't get these papers tight on these, they're stupid.
This one broke altogether this has.
Completely snapped it.
To give to Craig?
Oh!
Yeah.
I've got to collar him over weekend to see what he's doing.
I think he'll be a lot better anyway.
Well he likes it better there.
And he were always chirpy.
I do n't think I heard him whinge once.
And he left your fridge alone.
And I bet he's been down to see ducks.
He would of done.
I could n't get over it.
I still ca n't believe it actually.
Yeah he says that there were a right slanging match going off in town.
But I could n't stop laughing, me.
Has he phoned up since he's gone?
I were gon na say how was he doing.
He'll a took bairn out cos they'll of gone for extra funds, social and got, they'll be doing that at moment wo n't they?

He's done it all right.
And that were the mistake he made last time.
Well actually she's wrote the letter she's signed everything and everything so.

Wonder if her mother's been.
That's it.
Still nosey though are n't they?
Mm.
Well I ai n't seen her since erm.
possibly Wednesday, well I told her I were going up Thursday or Friday so I might nip up this aft.
I'll go get me cigs from.
Kwik Save.
so.
I watched him fetch me coal this morning and made sure he filled the bleeding bag.
I still had to buy three.
I got about two left in bunker.
and I bought three and I thought there should be five cos I did n't have a fire on Sunday at all and twice this week I have n't lit it till fi you know them four buckets.
that I had in there?
Well that were two days ago.
No it were day before, you said it Wednesday.
I said I had.
We did n't go in there yesterday did we?
Cos I come back to your house.
You've just had them they're in your coat pocket.
No I've still got one of them left have n't touched the coal since.
So you can say from Wednesday till today there's all coal that was in the bunker plus what they put on top.
Sh I should have at least half a bunker left.
Mm.
Yeah if he gets an interview for this job he's taking day off to do it.
He says he is now because April's coming up.
Newark.

I thought it were on past Worksop.
Flo did n't call last night.
She said she would.
I spoke to her on Wednesday, she seemed alright, never mentioned she were poorly.
I were talking to her for about half an hour.
And I says are you still working tomorrow?
She says yeah she says I'll pop in for a quick cuppa.
Cos I boiled kettle at quarter to five cos normally she gets here about five.
and I boiled it about quarter to five and I thought.
She did n't come, no.
She's always doing that.
I thought ooh.
Well I think Sarah's gone to work, sounds like it cos she has n't phoned and said owt.
I seen curtains open when I got up.
What time did you finally go to bed?
Oh you only got up for a coffee?
You look like I looked yesterday.

It's not doing anything?
And then you choke?
What time's Bill home today, half past twelve?
He'll be home between twelve and half past then.
It only takes him twenty five minutes?
Mm.
Oh tha so it's only half a day's ever?
Is it only a thirty odd hour week?
Steve's is.
Well if Steve goes for this interview he's working till, he'll not be in till half past eight because he says all that week he can gain four hours work because erm he's found out you do n't have to finish after two hours, you can work as much you like, finish at ten o'clock at night if you want.
Well I says to him I says well make sure, well it's five past eight he'd get in instead of five past seven.
cos all this week.
I've done well with his tea.
I've been putting it out just as he's walked in, I said I'm getting good me at this tea.
He says aye you wait till I change shifts.

Erm no little lad come for Avon money and everything from Alice but.

Our Darren and Sharon's arguing again.
Sarah's seen Sharon in town she says how's things and she went and she says where's Darren, have n't seen him for three days.
I thought bloody hell they're at it again.
They were alright up to Christmas.
But then again I seen them.

He's been a good lad, he's not been driving.

I do n't know how much they are.
But you.
Yeah well these are bigger.

top of a leg, i it's a lot bigger.
But.
I thought well I'll pop down.
Oh aye that size.
I'm not buying Steven an Easter egg.
I do n't know.
It's in April.
Well I'm giving him a tenner.
I thought why spend it all on chocolate because usually I buy about six or seven quid's worth of eggs, a mixture of eggs.
and he ends up with Creme Eggs and then proper eggs and that and I thought that's just a waste of money at his age cos when Easter comes up, four weeks after he's seventeen.
Do you know I calculate, I went on to him other night and I says you've only nine week.
then I turned round and says no you have n't you've got eight and a half weeks and he has n't he's got twelve and a half.
Till he's seventeen.
You were married then were n't you?
I thought you got married when you were sixteen?
No.
Forty seven, forty eight, forty nine, fifty, fifty one, fifty two, fifty three, fifty four, fifty five, fifty six, fifty seven, fifty eight and when did you get married again?
Sixty five.
Forty eight, forty nine, fifty, fifty one, fifty two, fifty three, fifty four, fifty five, fifty six, fifty seven, fifty eight, fifty nine, sixty, sixty one, sixty two sixty two you were fifteen.
That's sixty four.
He were born in nineteen sixty four were n't he?
Sixty six.
That makes you nineteen.
No that's right cos he were born in er.
you had him when you were eighteen, he were born in June and you was nineteen in September were n't you?
And it were sixty five you got married then?
Sixteen month you'd been married.
That's a year and four month.
Sixteen month you'd been married.
Do you want another cuppa?
Have you been picking?
Have you just done that?
I thought I were seeing things, blood.
Urgh first bit.
first bit of blood I've seen all.
Cough it up.
It's all we've been doing innit?
I'm surprised I have n't had any of it till now.
I've done ever so well.
But me luck do n't hold out forever does it?
Well that's what worri were upsetting you most were n't it?
I know!
Well you've got some colour at least this morning you did have.
That's one way to do it.
Have you seen Steve's fancy glasses?
Come from work.
Weird are n't they.
They're them safety glasses.
It is it's there.
Yeah.
I says they're only sun glasses.
Yeah just Mirage or summat they're called.
Cos we were messing about with them other day when he fetched them in.
Cos I says put them on and let's have a look.
he looked right stupid he did.
Hmm.
Thought bloody hell.
Look at this carpet, it's a bloody disgrace.
No I ca n't be bothered.
It's the thought of shampooing it that I ca n't be bothered about.
Ah.
I've got w I've got one.
I know why I've got one.
Other night we had bacon and egg and I did n't fancy it very much so I just had two slices of bacon and one egg and made a couple of sandwiches out of it.
But Steve always has two eggs.
Cos I thought bloody hell.
Toby enjoyed that?
Did Bill go to sleep?
How many cards did you get in end?
Six or seven.
Did you get one off Steve?
Oh you got one this time?

Did he post it?
Or bring it?
He brought it.
Oh yeah I've seen that, it's nice that one.
I meant to ask him if he'd decided if he were getting married or not and I forgot all about it.
I was that busy trying to convince him that he had to er go to doctors cos I says what did they actually do?
He says they lifted his eyelid up and just poured water in it and when they finished he says that he says.
it was still there, it had n't done.
he says and then they did n't do nowt else.
I says you ca n't see like that you'll be walking in I says go on, get down to nurse.
And I convinced him to go to nurse, that's why he was so long.
I thought well he's better off going to nurse and then she'll get that magnifying glass and have a look.
It wouldn't've surprised me that that he could feel were an eyelash like mine was.
It is a mess.
All this side of his face were puffing up with it were n't it?
I noticed the minute he come in.
He's got some stuff to put in it though has n't he?
Did they give him owt down at doctors?
Oh.
See I were that busy.
I never even noticed him come back cos I thought I'll leave back door unlocked and he come in and he put me hat and me keys down there, cos I noticed.
cos I walked in somebody walked in with me do n't know, and I says oh Stephen's been.
I know somebody walked in with me.
I ca n't remember who.
No I'd been to shop.
Oh it was Sarah.
Cos I went to shops for milk.
And she wanted to borrow a couple of videos.
So I lent her them.
Cos she says you would n't lend me none when I lived at Arthur's, I says no because every time I lent one at our Arthur's he swore black and blue it were his.
He was a swine for that.
complained how he says I've got one of his and I had n't got it, it's Linda that had got it.
She went up with little lad and he were watching it and he says I would n't mind this, well Arthur says I'd al he'd already taped it off telly and so he says I'll tell you what you can have it if you give me a blank.
tape back.
So he give it little lad.
Anyway because I were there with them you see he thought it were me that had got it and I says I have n't got it.
And then he said it were you that had got it, I says Maggie has n't been.
Yeah.
Well somebody's been he says, I says it were Linda, I says with little'un, I says you give it young'un, he says I did did n't I?
Well he remembers you and Irene.

But you got extra did n't you though?

Well it's bound to do int it?
I wonder if she has n't been down because she do n't know if you know or not.

I do n't know what it were, it were like great big bits of gristle or whatever it is but it were hard.
You know when you stew it.

He did n't want that.
So I went in and told them and they'd given me wrong sack.

It's cheap there.
Well it's not my fault.
Only a little bloody thing as it was.

Er n what heater?
Yeah well.
that bugger.
I've had.
It's alright for ha put it on for half hour maybe, you know, but you forget it.
you forget it and it stays on four bloody days.
Yeah.
And that's no good.
Costs too much that.
What I'll do is get a little light run down then you can see.
Yeah.
if light's on then you can tell oh immersion's on.
Instead of going upstairs all the bloody time to look.
Yeah ours is in airing, you've got to bend down and look at it to see if light's on.
It's stupid.
Yeah that's okay like when summer time comes and you do n't want a fire.
cos you're saving on the coal then we're you know.

Did n't you tell him?
What?
coalman in street.
That Ken fella the coalman.
He were parked up there well every coalman I've pulled him about this coke stuff and I'd seen him other day and I pulled him, explained that I were going over on April first.
Mm.
how much it is and he starts at five pound a bag.
Oh we'll have his then.
Yeah Ken he's called.
Er today.
Friday were n't it?
cos a man called and I caught him instead.
So it's in a minute I should see him.
At a fiver!
You pay five twenty five for that bloody.
coke.
It's not April yet.
You can see what it looks like.
You've got to remember, you know when your fire's lit?
I do n't want to see what it looks like.
You know when your fire's lit?
Yeah.
Once it's lit with that stuff you're supposed to shut your bottom all tight.
Waste of time with ours, it wants bloody cementing in.
Well it wants a new grate.
Well it's not the grate, it's the I think when we've cemented it together it wants a bigger fireplace for that.
Yeah.
for that boiler.
Eighteen inch.
Well that's a fourteen inch grate, fire a fourteen inch grate but you've got the gap all round it like so I thought eighteen inch.
I went to bloke there did n't I?
At er Wingfield Road and I said to them, I mentioned to them.
fourteen inch that way.
He says that's what you want but I said yeah but there ai n't no bloody fit I reckon it ought to be them on legs maybe.
Yeah, could be.
You know.
Have you tried a sixteen?
Wonder if we've still got ours.
I'll have a root in garage cos ours, you know when we had ours ripped out, Steve stuffs everything in garage and shed, and it had legs on, I'll have a look, that's a sixteen inch.
See if I can find it.
Yeah we went from sixteen to eighteen.
What's that?
What's that?
Fourteen or sixteen?
Mine's ginormous.
Costs a fortune.
I just got me coal and I was looking solvent and I've only got so many weeks and I've got to empty the stupid thing again.
I should n't bother I should just carry on chucking a bit on here and there same as everybody does, I ca n't see many buggers go for that bloody eight pound a bag.
Ooh I ca n't.
Briquettes.
They're called briquettes.
Yeah briquettes.
Yeah, five pound a bag.
It ranges from five to eight pound fifty.
Briquettes who's are they, briquettes?
It looks like coal.
Er.
How much how much did I tell you them briquettes were?
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah I told you a couple of weeks ago.
Geoff were telling me.
I can remember you telling her.
coalman?
I do n't know, all I know is.
Geoff was on about getting briquettes he said which were ever so cheap.
I asked him er about them and he says his mate always uses them and he says they're right good.
Yeah, they burn like hell do they?
Yeah.
Erm.
If you've got any left in top you use it to light again.
Yeah Geoff was saying something, bloody hell make it last longer cos I was telling you I says ooh not Coalite it's briquettes he said.
Yeah.
but I do n't know if that was five pound a bag, I think that was cheaper than five pound a bag.
Ooh.
Cos every time I spot a coalman I pull them.
Stop smoking then.
Told you last night smoked like hell yesterday afternoon, she coughed her bloody heart up last night.
Yeah.
She's done the same again now.
You better sleep down here I tell you.
I will.
I think he's tired.
I've never noticed.
It were n't no cheaper if they did were it?
Garage is as cheap as anybody here for fags.
I reckon they must be buying them knocked off.
Well everybody else is four forty six for half ounce of Old Virginia.
Her's is one forty two innit?
Yeah has always been cheaper.
How come the garage sells it cheaper?
Well they buy it in bulk do n't they?
Gateways must do, places like that but.
Well theirs are cheap.
Only one.
Yeah but.
I paid for mine.
yeah, not as cheap as garage.
It were.
Course the garage has gone up then.
All cigs in garage has gone up.
Have they?
They went up other week did n't they?
I have n't been there for oh I'm always going down there for petrol now.
Well I've got ta fill tank up again now.

It do n't last for long.
Oh dear.
I did well, I had hundred pound in me purse last night till Steve says can I have me pocket money and can I have me petrol and can I have this and I paid for coal and I've got forty.
I thought God I have n't even got shopping yet.
Then Access arrived, I thought bloody hell.
I did n't fetch money for it.
I only want cigs and.
I got mine on Monday did n't I?
She could n't believe it.
She had a panic.
No.
Yeah.
So I got it off Maggie and I went and got yours back, fetched it back over did n't I?
I've never heard of not being able to pay by, you ca n't, it was cheque, Access, nowt.
Well it says on there, big notices that shows you.
Oh I've never noticed.
that's why they keep the price low.
I did n't notice that before.
Cos every cheque they get and got ta put in it costs them money.
Oh.
So just cash and it's like a cash and carry innit?
It is yeah.
Cheap er cheaper stuff.
Well them dog biscuits, they're only a pound.
One forty six I paid.
