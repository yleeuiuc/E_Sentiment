
Their electric bill was sky high.
I did n't.
It was on.
Yeah.
Both.
Yeah, I think he did.
Out of the business.
Yeah.
And now, now they've come to realize that he's only on a wage, he's on a bloody good wage and all.
Right?
And they have grandad's money.
That buys all the bloody food.
Yeah.
All he lives on is his personal pension.
Yeah.
That's what he lives on.
And if he ever wants to buy anything.
Mm.
So basically I reckon they're gon na be in the shit.
Because er no mum was saying er they should be out enjoying theirselves, not having to stay in paying all this.
Yeah.
Now they've come to realize what it's like.
Yeah.
Yeah that was a month's wages, nearly.
Well a good part of it anyway.
I reckon she must get home, take home about eighty quid a week or something.
About hundred quid a week.
Yeah well no that's not bad money for a woman.
working er what she's doing.
Just started and all.
No I know.
Poor wages.
Poor payers I mean.
And I can see it in a year I I'll give it, give dad er about eighteen months.
and he'll be wanting to leave Avenue Panels.
It'll come too much.
Then he'll wan na form a partnership.
No.
No I would n't.
I'm happy as I am.
I'll have to see what it's like down the road.
If it's got room for expansion which I'm hoping then, I would say yeah because dad's got a good reputation.
Do n't know.
But he's not bad at spraying.
He's a good sprayer.
That's right.
The only thing the old man could do was spray.
He could n't every time he undid bolts like and if they were tight, he could n't do them.
Cos you've got to and he ca n't use his fingers and if he has to it right?
And ea each knock he used, used to be in agony.
Like if he was hitting something and he accidentally hit his ha his thumb or his finger he used to be in agony for I mean it used to hurt him for the rest of the day.
You know?
Whereas if I hit me hand you know, okay it hurts but it's gone in five minutes.
If I keep, keep hitting it like I did the other day when my brother was there me thumb and that, oh boy!
I mean it was.
swollen.
That's cos I kept hitting it, bloody.
But I could, I can hack the pain.
And that's the difference you see, it was gone day but dad's is not.
If he'd have kept hitting it like I h I hit mine no way.
They're good payers, restoration jobs.
Res restoration job you're talking er if you actually work on a vehicle a week, talking five hundred quid a week.
I mean that's two grand a month.
No but then you've got ta guarantee that you've got restoration jobs.
They've got to be guaranteed work like one after the other.
Oh yeah.
They probably will do cos.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh easily.
Easily I'd say.
That's why she ought to learn to drive.
If she drove she'd save money that way.
Okay you've got to fork out insurance and er petrol.
But in that sense she can use the car on her own.
She can go out shopping.
That's it yeah, the useless bloody thing.

Once they've had something they've got ta do it before they go, can you believe.
She's a right pain in the arse at times, me mum.
That's why they do n't go anywhere you see.

book, I have n't got one, yeah I've got an I C I guide book.
but it's not compatible, virtually the same but, but, the, the coat, primers and the, it's all, they're all called different, it's all different.
you know.
Oh look, that's Roger.
Roger driving that.
I told you it would.
they'll make er they'll make er what's names out of that, er.
units out of that.
good job I did leave were n't it?
I knew it would close.
it was so obvious, cos they were n't spending no money on it, the place was in a right state.
eh you like that do n't you?
I put a wing on that car.
yep.
me.
Oh sorry.
no, they have got, I mean I would of finished it if I did n't have to mess around with that car.
ah?
No, well I had to do the car first did n't I?
Yeah I'd considered buying it and all that, you know it do n't take five minutes you know, and I took it for a test drive.
er just down Water Road and back up again, and I talked to them, er, I see, I phone you and Stuart come in this morning.
done a financial and er my er, this afternoon I had a guy come in with a Capri, bloody welding that thing needs doing, I do n't think he'll get it done, so I was, I was.
nearly half an hour.
oh thank you, I do n't think I'll get that, too much for it and I got the guy I went out to see Lee he came in.
I said to him, my missus knows you.
but er, who she then?
I said er Lisa, so Alan, oh yeah, Charlie, I said that's right, yeah.
yeah, so anyway erm, he bought the car in to tell me that, garage down here, five hundred and forty eight pound labour right and that was put on another wing, save repairing the wing, put a new on, so what I did with mine is, I put on a new wing, right, and reduced the labour by sixty five quid to four hundred and five, I make plenty on the parts.
I will, see he probably has n't got as good as discount as me, so.
five hundred and for,.
He want's us to do it, apparently he's been recommended to me, I.
oh yeah, my that's good.
so er that's a sprayed bonnet, a brand new bonnet, spraying it.
with primer on, spraying inside and the outside, taking off both the wings and bump bit where the bonnet goes on to the slam pan, got ta take the er the wings out, I mean the, the lights out anyway.
We'll take them out and throw them away and that's all within the maker of the er, of the wings, er take them out, throw them away, er take the bumper off, throw that away, right, get a new number plate, a new bumper right cos the bumper's got to come off anyway with the wings.
there's no extra labour, I normally charge about a hundred and thirty pound for each wing, that's two hundred and sixty er eighty pound for the bonnet, well about a hundred pound for the bonnet, that's three hundred and sixty then er, forty five quid for the slam pan, that's it.
cut it all away, be off and done, about three days work.
four hundred and thirty quid, he said bloody hell, so what I said to him is, I know you're gon na need a car, what I'll do is er, I'll get to work, I'll put it, I'll bring the car, you bring the car in beginning of the month, next month, right, said I wo n't be able to guarantee that I'll get it done in a week cos I've got other work booked in, but I'll have it in here which means I'll be able to do work to your car, right, and it's better me being able to do that, then it, it's sitting out outside your house and nobody touching it for a couple of weeks, now, I might have it for a couple of weeks, see and I'll be able to do it in my own leisurely time then.
yeah, I work on these other cars and I'll be able to do that in the meantime.
Yeah he says oh that's great, yeah that's fine, so I'll have to get it in soon because I wo n't be able to get him in till about.
