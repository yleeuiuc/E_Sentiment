Oh yeah, walk down there in a little while.
Okay.
I'll get the stuff in first anyway.

Is it all in the car?
Can you move that one?
Yeah.
Well then when you're driving along you, you have n't got any music.
Yeah, it's not nice in the car without a stereo.
So I'll leave.
Aha.

Yeah, I'll put put it in my room actually.
We did n't know what to get Marion.

There is n't any other way dad?
To set this on to that.

No, th the.
Yeah it suddenly bits of like there.
But it all comes shooting down in one.
It's the.
go.

And I get such a fright cos I keep expecting a bird.
That's the soot.
to come flying.
No.
out.
Usually erm it er.
Thank you.
it probably needs erm probably cleaning, or at least looking at.
I'm too scared to look up there.
Oh bloody hell!
No, I, I should n't.
Why wo n't you go in there?
Right.
Any luck?
No not yet.
Was it?
I'll just take.
Oh it's a good one, I have n't seen this in there.
That's your broad edging.
Screw that,.
So the, cos apparently it reaches right into the erm like living room but all around the.

the house.

Which is quite go ooh!
Picture's quite good until you get a play.
Yeah.
Can you get the telly down for me?
Might have to.
Oh is something in the way?
Appears to be.
I do n't know why.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Anyway.
Let's find the other side here.
Have a go.
Nothing's ever simple in this house.
Oh.
That one's gone in.
Hooray!
Well perhaps that one played that way then.
Zippy doo!
In that case I've er you put that.
Put that back up and I'll wire round this to connect.
Well that one, is, is up.
That's it.
That's that.
Right.
Put that back on.
Just there.
That's that on with those.
I'll move this out the way.
Oh that does n't look too bad.
No.
It's it's fine when you see it.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Right?
I believe James could even be a dentist.
Yes.
Be quite happy.
I expect that.
I got my N H S thing back.
Oh yeah?
Erm.
They were crap!
crap really.
Was it?
Just money or or nothing.
No free prescriptions.
Oh!
Do n't know what they expect.
How much they expect you to.
Oh well.
pay out.
I'd probably best to put it all in a all in the corner there.
Okay.
I was gon na shove it.
Can you get it behind there?
Want to sort of put on the top of the wardrobe and then make it drop.
Oh I see, I'm with you.
back.
Okay.
Alright, well you run what you want round there.
Hold on.
Let me undo this a wee bit.
There we are.
Yeah so it's, it's on the floor just just chuck it over there.
Okay.
Hang on love.
Oh it's no.
That's fine over there.
Okay.
It's right behind the.
Yeah, that's fine.
Right be.
crate there.
And where d'ya want it?
On top of the on the top of the cupboard d'ya think?
Out the way.
Erm yeah I, just at the back, or.
Or, or just, or just up a bit?
Or if you can sort of.
Wedge it in there.
leave it in.
Yeah, well let's have a look.
You take the curtain and that hook.
That's it.
Do you want me to hammer that cos it's pinned?
All over there.
Is it?
I think you might be wrong.
Not that good, but it looks good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
there.
Now, just underneath that fuse box just kept it low.
Oh lovely.
Cheers.
It's done?
All you've got ta do is hope now that you get a decent picture.
Turn it on.
Do you like my wardrobe?
I did it last Saturday.
Hey?
Watching the doctors.
Oh right.
I changed it.
Half my photos are still on the wall at home.

but erm no wonder I could n't find them.
Thought I'd put a few of them up.
Hooray!
Good.
Yes.
It's a clear picture.
That's alright.
It's a clear picture.
Keep on the football I shall be alright.
Tt!
Perfect.
Yes, I wan na see whe the good goal one.
Put it on tape then.
Arsenal nil, Manchester City nil.
Ah oh!
Not so bad.
God!
Dad!
England did really well did n't they?
Oh God!
Chronic!
Terrible!
Why are they doing so badly?
Is it Graham Taylor?
Oh Ferdie was n't playing was he?
No.
No.
That's sad that.
Cos I think he would have made a bit of difference up front there wi er er cos they would have the defence.
They put in Mottley.
Yeah.
The defence was very bad.
Old Graham Taylor's mate.
Yeah.
I realized old, old Ferdie was n't playing.
Yeah.
The defence was very slow as er er, when who was it?
Merson ran at them.
Yeah.
er but er, they and also Platt I mean, Platt got pulled down.
Okay, next job on the agenda yo you got some trouble with the radiator?
Yeah, it just does n't.
Which one's this?
My one.
Is er, I do n't know if there's something wrong, but it does n't the heat is n't well Angie's one's like boiling hot.
Yeah.
Susanna's one does n't really work at all, but my one's just like lukewarm.
Oh well, let's have a look.
Let's have a look at this.
So.
then, this.
we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just was n't worth our while to sort of mess.
No.
around and try and do any more.
No, no.
That's right.
Cos we just got a real fright when we could n't stop the water pouring out.
Oh.
It's the little washer thing.
Just turn the tap.
Well I'll get cleaned.
Come on, you take the stuff down and rather me just try and.

And then er, once I've done that I've got ta nip up the top and get a comb.
I know I do I forgot to take one down to the place with me I checked the then that, now we go.
It's alright, I'll get you one in Twickenham and I'll pay in that money as well.
Okay.
Alright.
Fair enough.
Could do.
Well, do you normally walk in or, or, or do you expect a ride?
What do you wan na go.
You.
on the bike?
Oh I see.
Oh just as easy to erm.
What go by car?
go by car.
Oh.
It takes about well.
About two ticks, ya.
Alright.
Fair enough.
I've still got oh no, ticket's run out now.
What, four pound for one hour?
Oh I'll just run in.
Okay.
Right now.
The alternative is, do you wan na si this is where you running here, you.
Dunno what I just done with the key actually.
Tt!
Boy!
That's bad.
Not to worry.
Not to worry.
Erm what we can do is er use something here.
I bought this lot down with me.
It might be in the other room actually.
Now so the thing, and that goes in here, can use.
Oh!
What, is it a spanner?
It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing.
Oh.
Just that I think Susanna wants to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have if she gets back in time, fair enough.
Just thingie that.
Still, do you think you better bleed it completely and let all the water out?
No, not let the water out, you let the air out.
When you bleed.
Oh I see.
it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it.
Oh I dunno, I do n't know what we did at that.
Oh it's alright.
but it just does n't seem to be working very effectively.
I mean, obviously it's off now but erm.
Is.
Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things whereas this one takes a bit longer.
Hello?
That's got a a key down there.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah I said we'd erm drive over to Marion's on our way out and then give her a pressie.
Mm.
I had a really nice meal actually in erm tt a place in Teddington.
Oh yes?
It's just li.
What's it like?
It's a sort of Italian place.
I had a really nice chicken erm Mexican pasta thing.
Really nice!
It's a really smart place.
Mhm.
And er you'd better get that key actually.
Oh.
I hope it's in the other room hopefully.
Mm.
While you're doing that chuck us my thing over there as well.
Oh great!
We won!
Ca n't hear ya!
Oh gre oh lovely!
Whoopee!
We won!
We won!
It could ne it could have been two two, but er Stejskal saved a penalty in the last minute.
Oh dear!
Oh lovely!
Oh, I think I must, I'll give her a ring.
I really do n't know I'll see where she's put it.
Well where is she then?
At home.
Where does she live?
Sheffield.
I'll give her a ring.
I ca n't think where well it must be somewhere in the office.
I ca n't think where at the moment.
I have n't got, da da, da da.
Right.
She's not in.
Mm.
Yeah.
Hello Angie?
Hello.
I hope you do n't mind me phoning you, but where's the radiator key?

But er.
Good Lord!

Twenty six.
Oh that's not bad.
Just practically put on a down there.
It's not very far.
But, well go now so that does n't really count.
You'll have to trust me, it'll be alright on the night.
he wanted to take it anyway.
So, we're gon na have to come an agreement of what she's got there.
Yeah.
Of course!
Yeah they, erm.
Going down to Pizzaland.

Yeah.
Tomorrow.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh I said, I just want to.
Ca n't you just take him out?
Oh yes, I think you were quick.
Yeah.
Well he did n't say goodbye Dad.
Dad!
Yeah?
Do you want it in there?
Yeah sure.
They actually went home because erm it's her friend's twenty first.
Oh I see.
and erm she li she's in Egham and her boyfriend came down and was driving her back to Sheffield and then driving back again here on Monday so she got a free journey home.
Oh I see.
Which basically I mean she's had so she thought it would be nice for her to get away just to sort of sa you know have a breather from it all.
Does that make sense actually.
I dunno.
Oh look!
Q P R!
That's it.

Oh er, hey!
Hey!
Look!
Yeah, but there's seven teams in front of them dad.
Yeah I know but er I do n't mind that.

Now can you get some me some matches and tape something like that?
Erm, I do n't.
And this does n't turn is it?
What?
It does turn.
Yeah.
Well, well it just gets dirt because erm.
Okay.
You get some kitchen paper and I'll bleed it.
I do n't.
Well I might need a hand.
You have to make a move in.
Do you need a tea towel?
Well ca n't we do it when we get back?
Bloody hell! of confidence.
I'm not going to do any drinking.
Yeah because when we get upstairs I think something in here fell out so we're trying to get it back on.
It's all this went down here.
Now I can see why the water comes out and then air so.
Oh so you do n't really lock it?

And is it on, er, is it on properly down there?
I do n't.
Well if, if you can just.
There, there, there's no.
No.

This is open.
Er get in this you see, if you wind it down.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.
So that's all open.
I do n't, I do I think he's set it to come on later so.
Is it?
Well I can, well I can put it on earlier so we can see if it works.
Okay.

Chivalrous?

Yes.
Chivalrous.
Cos when you get your takeaway they erm they carry it to the door for you and give it to you when you get to the door, and they hand.
Oh!

It's very nice actually.
Oh!
Whe, when we went to the one in Twickenham, James really like it sort of go out for a ni Indian meal and stuff.
Quite enjoyed it.
Lovely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
So when's his tour?
Oh er, it's er late July early August of ninety four.
Oh!
Not long really.
No.
Oh.
Lovely thanks.
Thank you.
Alright, thank you.
I'll take the first one, that one is sweet.
It's so nice.
You just dip in like that do you?
Yeah.
Or sort of put it, wha however really.
Or put bits on your plate and then just like put this is a, I think this is a lime one.
Mm!
They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had.
They do n't like, used to have a little.
That one's quite hot I think.
That's erm something or other.
Or just put it onto your poppadom like that.
Easier to put it straight on.
Mm.
So we, with your pensions and things is mum, what about mum does she know what about the state pension and stuff?
Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you.
Oh.
get it on one.
Because she has n't worked, nothing?
Mm.
Well, so and th, and the husband.
So married woman's like if their husband left them and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered?
Or are they not?
I do n't know.
I do n't know, it's, it's er it's a little harder to say the least.
Is, if they we, if he's left I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing.
Oh right.
But it's not so much nowadays though.
You have a the problem if the husband remarries.
Yeah.
Er, er, you know, who gets the.
I suppose it's pretty difficult really.
No you ca n't.
Sorry.
Erm, with mum i i i is fine because she could from my point of view so, and also as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank she gets.
Oh!
a widow's pension from the bank.
Oh right.
so that she does n't so we get nothing for.
Oh right.
It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really?
Oh yeah.
And of course even that's going to change as time goes on.
Really?
So what happens like, with me?
Like teaching?
Do I need to do I, they do n't do anything.
Well you may have, you may have to look after yourself in fact.
Yeah.
Cos obviously it's different for you.
That's the thing.
Erm er it will be see if you can pay into something.
Mm.
er soon after you start your job.
Yeah.
I'll think about it.
So, say as, say erm, say by the time you're you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty.
Yeah, cos I'll be working well I'm twenty one.
I'm doing a third year I'll be twenty four.
Mm.
when I qualify.
Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really.
Well you can start off with you see, a small sum as regards an insurance policy.
Yeah.
Then take the twenty five or thirty years.
Is that what you've done?
That's how you're paying?
No.
The two, the two insurance policies I had of erm er the house were on.
Oh right.
and when we moved I think we had a new insurance policy to cover and the others became mine.
Oh right.
That's why it's very important cos I have n't got my early matured pay from Roberts and the other one in fact matures next year with everything attached to it except for one.
Oh right.
of you, for you.
Yeah.
And the lump sum I can then could put in mum's name to avoid.
Yeah.
paying tax on the interest.
Oh right.
And then just utilize a little each year.
Yeah.
Oh right.
We should get help with James though should n't we?
Well at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for.
Oh.
James so, if there is something, all well and good.
Oh yeah.
I do n't see how they can justify I mean, anybody, unless you'd got mega bucks.
Mm.
you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly in one goes ' a big, bi, like quite a shock.
And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever but paying it out in one go or.
Well the thing is they're not gon na get any wind of erm what so he's gon na get sacked.
Gone into erm money.
And that way, any interest on erm it becomes tax free.
Yeah.
Oh!
So again, I have to be careful because real interest is gained on this money that's in grand mama's name.
Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er Nigel's.
Yeah.
There's not that much there though is there?
There's enough.
Really?
Yeah, it's erm.
Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn?
Yes.
It was very pleasant.
The the journey up there was erm.
Mum said, your mum's going a bit mental?
Oh, probably is.
To put it politely.
I expect she is.
Does she see your brother much?
She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round.
Really?
Mm.
Oh good.
Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy she's er that she's comfortable.
Yeah.
er i in her place.
It's been wonderful!
Mum said it's really nice.
Mm.
What is it?
It's not is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for?
Along, along th that sort of line.
Erm you have a war, warden who lives on, the premises you have contact with the wardens and if there's any problems you can.
Yeah.
pull a cord and they erm use a.
It's a bit like the one we we, went to see Aunty Mary's when we to.
Oh that's true.
tidy it up.
And this is really what.
So is it, is it private or or erm.
Well it's her trust.
Oh.
It's her trust.
So she pays?
She pays a certain amount, but erm you get erm.
Subsidised.
That's right.
Yeah.
This is really what Ma-in-law should have done.
Yeah.
About the same sort of thing.
Oh yeah.
Well, just to sit there it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up.
Sorry?
Mum's fed up.
Oh yeah.
She was telling me the other day.
But it's just.
But erm.
I dunno, it's just so awful!
Well.
It just turned everything so sour.
Mm.
But it probably was, I mean probably deep down if we did n't see her, probably got on quite well with her.
But you, you just see to much of her that now.
Yeah.
that it's just got no got no wanting to talk to her or.
Mm!
or no, you know, anything.
Well no, you see.
Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she does n't do anything.
I do n't know.
But the problem I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you we found that she'd, she just kept on telling us off.
And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it was n't and, there was no thought at all toward.
No.
the children.
Yeah.
And as I say, there was always one I remember that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December five weekends on the trot!
Yeah.
Mm mm.
I was going mental!
Well that's it.
So what did she say to you?
Nothing.
Well,.
I do, I hope but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but but when you have a position where you have five.
Yeah.
people in the house.
It's very stressful.
I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms there.
Yeah.
is n't a space there.
Well not if it's not designed for it.
I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa, I, I I, there's too many here.
Mm.
And course it's reached the point of no return now where she she ca n't do anything for herself.
Well there's nothing, yeah.
You just ca n't do it.
But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us.
Mm mm.
between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve.
Well it's.
and herself.
Yes.
Which is such a shame because like, we all, wi, we all get on really well with William.
Sure.
You know, like more, more brother, si.
Yeah.
brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else.
But, you know, you do n't wan na keep her off.
Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff.
But there is an underlined current there.
Mm.
which is erm, Mum is aware of.
Oh definitely.
But you know the situation is it's like Mum should not expect just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gon na co.
Yeah.
and, and settle down in Brentwood.
I'm, I, I'm sorry.
It's happened too many times now that she's.
You can.
really just, you ca n't break it.
You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her hold on that that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her.
Yeah.
and will continue to, to, to, erm so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her.
Very, very difficult.
Well that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way would we get ourselves in that position for you you have your lives to lead.
Yeah.
get on with it.
There's no point ruining a good relationship by.
That's right.
Yeah.
things like that.
Just turns everything sour.
So how was your weekend.
Ah.
in Sheffield?
Did you go wa, get around to see much at all?
Erm, not much.
What did we do?
The Friday we finally got there at about the traffic was so bad because Friday night as well.
You'd gone up in, oh yes.
Erm.
Do you want a bit more?
No, I've had, I've had erm two already.
Erm we went out.
Go on.
Ca n't remember.
Ca n't remember what I want now.
Right erm could I have the er the mild korma down here please?
Yep.
And the king prawn korma.
And the king prawn korma.
Not for me thanks, no.
Erm what do you want the, the the paratha.
Pi, pilau, yeah.
One of those do you?
Yeah, just one.
And, we wanted?
One pilau and one mushroom.
One pilau and.
one mushroom.
and one mushroom rice.
And one mushroom rice.
Yes thank you.
Do you want any nan bread?
No, I'm fine thank you.
No, thanks a lot.
Right.
Thank you.
Okay?
That's it.
Lovely.
Thank you very much.
Lovely, thank you.
Yeah so, Friday night we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy.
It was really good actually.
We went into Sheffield right into the city and went to a pub.
It was pouring down with rain though.
So heavy!
We got so soaked.
We could n't find a taxi so we thought well we may as well start walking.
Yippee!
Oh there is it?
Oh!
What's happened now?
Looks a bit dead to me.
!
I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers.
So he smiled at me.
Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice.
He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something.
But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so.
Oh I see.
Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue?
Jus, just there Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham.
It's the roads you know where our house is?
Just.
Yeah.
the road sort of, sort of here.
Oh!
I see.
Yeah.
That's where it was.
Only takes about takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station to get like to London and Kingston and e all your other sort.
Oh I see!
of stuff.
Just sort of up that way.
Oh yes.
So that's good.
So it's quite good.
is n't it?
So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away.
So it's easier to go to Witham.
You have to change.
Mm.
at Twickenham though, that's not too.
Oh oh.
bad.
But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car.
Oh.
That's alright.
And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well.
Vicky.
So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham.
Oh yeah.
So I must go and see her.
I was thinking maybe next weekend I might or meet her for the day.
Yes, you must.
or something.
Yeah!
Well you'll have to go down there.
And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well.
And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton.
So we're all sort of in the same, very.
Yes, oh yes you must.
close vicinity.
well.
so we're all gon na go out for dinner or something.
We said.
Yeah.
when we're all settled in.
So I must give her a ring this week actually.
I did n't realize how close we were.
I'm so, I've.
No.
got no sense of geography, like, I just, did n't really, have n't got a clue.
You should, you should ge, if you look on a map you can, you can judge where.
I know you can, but really I ca n't I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map.
Yeah.
Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map and we're all sort of cut off.
Well then.
Yeah.
I have n't got a clue where I'm going.
No.
As for buses, I er, just have n't got a clue.
I never used one before until I came here.
Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a.
Honestly I.
train for.
I really have n't got a clue.
a form of transport.
So I do n't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going.
Yeah.
Have n't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet?
Yeah, but I'm hopeless!
Mm mm.
I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I did n't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew where I was going and everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me.
I'm, they must think I'm so thick!
I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before I know I can get off the bus.
And that's the way it goes.
Oh right.
Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it.
Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are.
It's just such a worry though.
Well no, no.
No, no.
Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag.
I just tell everyone I'm new in the area.
So I just say I'm really new in the area.
So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area.
The thing is do, I do n't think I'd know.
I would n't know how to get a bus.
I would n't have a clue where to go.
Oh no, I'd, I'd, I probably would n't either but er er, the thing is, it's the he e, having to live here for well say, at least three.
Yeah.
years it's really matter of getting hold of a map.
Oh yeah.
a a and using it.
I'm working my way slowly but surely.
Ye you should.
sh how to get around.
How we doing for time?
Mm.
Not bad.
It's always busy.
It's twenty five to ten.
Ho oh!
My God!
Mm mm.
Oh!
It smells so nice.
Well, okay.
You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better.
What's happening for James ' birthday?
I do n't know at the moment.
I have n't even thought about it.
At least he does n't want a party.
You're safe.
No, oh.
with that one.
Well the thing is, er, I, I can.
It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way.
I, I think he's drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family.
I think he realizes that er there's a heap lot of trouble out there.
Yeah.
er er he could become involved.
Yeah.
with if he just let go.
Yeah.
Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously at that age it's very impressionable and very like they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out.
Yes.
drinking or whatever, and causing trouble.
The thing is that, really, that they all they've done is show themselves up.
Cos.
Mm.
I, I was surprised when I heard of sort of the things that had happened.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but, you know, they're.
I'm impressed with the warnings.
For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though.
Yeah sure.
Sure.
I think that's re, cos that's.
He.
the only way.
Yeah.
cos the majority.
Yes, you're right.
have n't got a clue.
Yeah.
No.
what anybody does.
Yeah I know.
Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they.
Silly.
are.
Even in somebody else's house you.
Yeah.
just show respect.
Oh, yes.
I mean, no matter what you're doing yo, or where you are you just show respect for other.
Yeah.
people's property or.
And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gon na happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away are n't they?
Mm.
I hope the master.
I think the teachers are gon na have to be there.
Well, they'll be.
I think they're gon na have a tough time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have two more Cokes I should think.
Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke?
Yeah.
Can I have a another two Diet Cokes please?
Thank you.
I think the teachers co, but I think the teachers realize what they are like.
I think they're just gon na have to be really, really strict with them.
Well,.
Well they would be o, they're representing too many people for them to misbehave.
Well I,.
I, I hope, in fact, that i, if one does th.
It's no ignoring it.
yeah, well the.
till it.
thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back.
Yeah.
to the U K.
But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble.
Mm.
would stop.
I think you.
Cos I do n't think, er no, I do n't thi, there did n't seem to be any hassles with William's lot.
No, well but er it, it, it's it just strikes me as being a very, very immature when you're in another person's house.
Yeah.
Lovely thanks.
Thanks.
Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically.
Yeah.
It's sick!
You can turn them off.
Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding.
Oh yes.
I think I'll have those in the bedroom window.
Did you put my red light up yet?
I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends.
And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like I'm sorry, what's going on?
Yes.
That's it.
Come on mate, I'm starving!
No, no advances on his, on his salary soon.
It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels?
Like und, that was underneath?
D'ya remember that res, you know when we went to Brussels and stayed above the sort of Indian restaurant?
Oh yes!
Yes I do.
Thanks very much.
Yes that was a little bit out.
But, ah yes, I remember.
Yes.
Yeah.
Cor!
You have a long memory.
Certainly have.
It's there somewhere.
Do you remember it?
Yes.
That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually.
Well yes, a couple of years ago.
It was when James went to Russia.
Oh!
That was it.
Er near, near er Skiptia.
Oh yeah, that's why he was n't there.
near Skiptov.
Oh that was it.
Robert was in, at, at, University.
Yeah.
Oh that was it.
She must have been away so we took flight.
Yeah.
That was good actually.
It was quite nice.
Except of course, I er, I, I could n't read my road map there in, in Brussels.
My goodness me!
Was a bit of a mare was n't it?
Ah!
It was terrible.
Because the thing had changed so ma, so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me.
Yeah.
And secondly, as regards where they were the road maps did n't seem that did n't coordinate that.
Yeah.
well.
Has he got a job?
I do, I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er with the bank.
Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back.
Mm.
on the damn thing again.
Well I ca n't even find the M twenty five!
No.
I was surprised it to, we well going to this place yesterday er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty.
Yeah.
five on the M four, the M four we look for er er exit eight is it eight?
Yes it is.
After that, we started in trouble.
We went into the village of that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al, along the road, erm you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo, to, to, to Bray.
Oh yeah?
Bang!
We were on the motorway.
where's this bloody sign!

So, we went along for, about five minutes, could n't pick anything up so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was.
Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway.
But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it did n't tell you the other side, you have to come.
okay.
You have to lose your way, come back, yeah.
That's it.
So we we, we turned down this road, through the village and we could n't find Monkey Island.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh alright.
Fair enough.
So we stopped again.
I went across and yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left.
So, up we go the road narrows straight past the first left, there is n't a sign for Monkey Island at all.
Mm.
I said, what the bloody hell's happening here?
So went in the car park, turned back took the first er er, er well I did a right then.
Yeah.
there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island.
But you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great.
Well it would be, yeah.
Ah!
Really great!
And we were n't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er.
I'm not surprised.
Terrible!
Terrible!
So what is it, a, an actual island?
It's an actual island, yes, and you see.
And how bi, quite big, it must be quite big.
Is it big?
It's not that large, but it's, yo yo get a.
You just take it over for the weekend?
Well, we, we, we, mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island.
Yeah.
the th, the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath.
It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too.
Oh I see.
because of the water.
But this was a boat was saw s, over the up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er whether it had been tied up too tight in fact I wo, now, now for leeway and the thing had just sunk.
Oh.
Oh blimey!
Yeah th, the water level's just.
Really?
just a, you know, way up above the the main er.
thing, yeah.
But, there's the the main, er, hotel that you book into and you come away from there to the dining area and erm and the reception.
Oh I see.
Oh quite pleasant.
Must cost them a fortune.
Mm mm.
D'ya get everything paid for?
Everything paid for.
Well I gather everything's paid for, all, all the.
all yo, if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all.
Erm.
Did they like your phone bill from erm.
Oh crikey!
They wo n't be paying for that.
Where was it?
Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland.
That's it.
I could n't think where you'd been to.
Oh.
No, i, it should be that.
The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I did n't have a lot to drink I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction.
It's not worth it just for one week is it?
and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six I did some.
Why d'ya get up so early?
You know just to well ease myself in really.
I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call.
Mental man!
er, no not really.
Really ju, just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out.
I had breakfast at seven sent up, up to the room, ah and then just watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the television.
Cos you can put the channel just to show the time and.
Oh right.
and one or two others.
Oh that's right.
Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er twenty to nine.
Oh!
I was one of the lucky ones because they were having done that the others in fact left it until later and in fact they took, they, they called up for time.
Ah oh.
You know.
You're not as dumb as you look are you?
No, no.
Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to Manor of the Groves where I tried to book out erm and found I was late for the first erm.
,.
first erm meeting.
Give your apologies as you walk in.
Well yes, and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if.
You know these, these, V P's.
V P's, yeah.
sits down and says.
So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught.
And it's paid off.
It was a, a nice place.
Nice and sunny.
Ba, I had.
Yeah.
lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till till quarter to two erm and then went back inside.
But you, you sat outside for the best part of quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny.
And it was a.
When the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice.
Oh it's beautiful!
Yes.
It's just and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out and just could not be bothered.
It was really.
Mm.
pelting down.
Oh it was when we were gon na go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really can not be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to.
Yeah.
get the bus and I thought, oh er so luckily Lisa sa, like they said, oh do n't be silly we'll come and get you.
So luckily, they like drove round and picked me up.
Oh I see.
and just brought me back again, which is fine.
Right.
But, just when you've got no transport and it's.
Mm mm.
pouring down with rain it's it's just such an effort to motivate yourself to get up to.
Oh God!
Yeah.
It's like when we had no wa, like heating or water, it was such an effort to get yourself up.
Yeah.
to get ready to go out and the.
Yeah.
just, cold showers and stuff are like.
Oh bloody hell!
not on my list of like pleasurable er.
No.
things to do.
Just like, no way!
No I I mean, we, I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there peahens.
Oh yeah!
Oh really?
Mm mm.
I see.
I say, it i, it's nice, I mean, unless you you really know about it you have no idea at all.
No.
No idea.
I suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well.
Mm mm.
If anything.
The kind of thing you ought to do with with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch.
It'll be.
Yeah.
visit.
It's not that far is it?
Well it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter.
Pick me up on the way.
Ha, ha, ha!
Joke!
I see, so we go round the M.

twenty five, up to the M four.

yes!
Yes.
Any minor detour.
Any minor detour.
There'll be convenient roadworks at Twickenham.

Save it.
Yeah.
Cos,.

Help yourself.
Ooh it's lovely!
No, I, the thing is erm I'm not a very hot curry man so I.
No.
just sort of this is mild.
Nice bit of bread..
Oh no.
That's nice actually.
Is it?
Bon appetit.
Mm mm!
It smells, can you smell on the food, it's lovely.
Mm.
Were n't, although erm I was told that my father died of that so that er, I should do you mind.
What, from smoking?
cutting down?
From smoking.
Did he?
Oh I did n't realize.
I mean he died of, cancer, cancer of the lung, cancer of the lung, yes.
Oh I did n't realize it was that.
Oh I see.
Mm.
I did n't realize it was from smoking.
And they said that er yo, you're you'll be war, the signs would then, in fact, that er there was a link up.
Mm.
with that.
And until that I did n't reali.
Oh I did n't realize he died cos.
I, I, I, carried on smoking for a number of years after that.
Well you never think it's gon na happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything.
You never ever think.
But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too.
Yeah.
many bloody chemicals added.
Yeah.
now that do have a, a, sort of a lasting effect.
Yeah.
I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like the amount of damage they've done.
Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's.
by them stopping it's not gon na really do anything.
it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing.
Well, Ma, you know Mark who stayed with us?
Oh yeah.
His chest is so bad, it really ma, it's a bad smoker's cough.
Oh.
Horrendous!
And he, he reckons he smokes way too much.
Mm mm.
But basically that's because of.
Well yes, the.
his family, you know.
family, yeah sure.
Sure that's always outlet.
sort of understand, yeah, something you've, you know, why he does it.
Which is really sad.
He's a really sweet guy.
But erm.
Just thinks too much and smokes too much.
Well well I do, I heard it over the weekend in fact, that I can er, have er, another BUPA medical to start with.
Really?
Er, yeah.
At the place just not far away from er, where I work.
Oh that's quite good.
So I, I mean, I've got to go in for that.
Did you, what, do you have to pay for it?
No, the bank pays.
I see.
Oh that's really good.
Every, yeah, well one can have it every two year, er.
Oh.
having said that, the last one I had was er I had at le, I think at least four years ago.
Yeah.
So yes, it was very nice indeed.
That's lovely, thank you.
Very nice.
That's very enjoyable.
That's alright.
That's okay.
You're a bit busy in here.
That's okay.
No problem.
I see you've got quite a full house here.
You came to us highly recommended anyway.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Ooh!
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's quite nice to get checked out and then, to know that everything's alright or thin, that anything that's wrong can.
Yeah.
be stopped if you get it, if you stop it early.
Well.
enough.
well I think.
What's that for?
it has a, do n't know what it is.
I suppose they must put these in the the oven I would.
Yeah.
think, is er right?
They have loads of them.
Put them on most of the tables I think.
Probably save them loads of money as well.
Oh well.
No thanks.
Does n't it?
Suppose.
What?
they've got loads of money if they they sort you out.
Oh sure.
now?
Yes.
Yeah.
That's right.
So what do you want for sweet?
I do n't know.
I might have a sweet actually.
Mm mm.
Mm.
I think it, you've got to have one for a change.
Oh right.
Okay.
Oh that's lovely.
I'll just settle for that.
They're steaming actually.
Well you get them they're really, really hot.
Lovely thanks.
Right, which one?
Thanks a lot.
They're lovely!
They're so nice.
Phworgh!
Oh Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!
A novel way to use your oven is n't it?
Cor!
It's gorgeous!
Mm.
Mine's not gorgeous.
That's gorgeous!
Bit of a.
Round the ears.
Round the ears.
Mm, it'll clean up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's all we came here for, you know.
Well, yeah.
Cocktail.
Cocktail.
Really.
No er, no it's.
No er.
lovely actually.
It's all lovely.
Yes.
I'm really beaten now actually.
Yeah.
Well it's a.
It came at the right time.
E each of them approved.
Yeah.
Am I still covered under BUPA?
I think so.
Erm, I, I wa, when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out.
I'm not ill or anything so do n't worry at the moment.
Er, but I, I, I, I think erm I think had it out up until Robert is baby.
He, he's joined his own wo, he's joined his own.
He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college.
Yeah.
I think he said he was covered actually.
Well I do n't know.
Well I'll find out so, at least then er, if there is, you know, you're.
Yeah.
aware of, of what.
Yeah.
one can do.
Well, it's, it's very, very handy actually.
Oh sure.
It's a very good thing.
That's right.
if you've got the money, sort of, the means to do it.
Well I think.
then do.
the bank pays and it.
Yeah.
comes out from from.
Ye.
from my tax.
Yeah.
I do, I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health in this kind, but to know that you're covered rather.
Yeah.
than er.
Oh yeah.
er ha, have problems er er er, er when, when you.
Definitely.
require something.
It's so much easier.
Especially like my tonsils and stuff.
That was like the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it it's like, you know.
Yeah, er, yeah.
what's the point in waiting around?
Well.
Those tables things are quite good are n't they?
Those little hoover things they use?
Oh yes.
Over there.
Mm.
Very interesting.
Well it's different innit?
Mm.
Much quicker though.
.Not very big actually is it?
Big restaurant.
No.
I would have thought it would have ex extended by the door.
No I do n't think it does.
but it does n't.
It's the.
Ah perhaps to the toilet.
There's loads er like, in the window when we, like newspaper articles and things where it's been recommended and stuff.
Ah I see.
For, you know, they all, all put them up.
Well d'ya know what I have n't to your place yet, the, fireplace.
I have n't put the up.
Oh yeah.
Well you can do that before you go.
I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a a po pouring out.
Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean.
Definitely.
And er I was gon na, er er, look up the thing.
Do n't, it does n't work apparently.
Cos Jim who was in there last year said it did n't work when he was there.
Oh oh.
So I do n't, I do n't know if it's attached or anything, I do n't know.
I'm not sure.
I have n't been gassed yet anyway, so I do n't think any gas or anything's coming out.
No.
And you'll find your stuff's staying there?
No I kept a couple.

of newspapers but er.
Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact.
It's.
so, so, if I.
I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought strange!
No, you can have a read of it if you like, but I'll scrunched the others up there, stuff them in there, stuff.
Bit of local news.
Eh?
Bit of local news.
Bit of local news.
Mm.
Stuff.
Oh.
Seems like ages since I've been home actually.
It's go.
Yeah.
time's gone quickly really here, really quickly.
But on.
Well.
the other hand i, it does seem, seem.
well you've been occupied here have n't you.
Yeah.
really?
Er, that's the thing.
But then, it just seems like ages since I've been home.
I think I've spoken to mum nearly every day this week actually.
Yes.
She kept phoning me up to tell me about Crowded House tickets and that she could n't get any.
I ca n't believe that we're not going.
So gutted!
I mean, he does n't like them!
No.
He never liked the band.
And he's going to see it.
And I ca n't even get one ticket.
Go and buy myself one.
I'm gutted!
I really am.
You'd think he would either apply for another one or, or let you have his.
I've told him, if anybody's ill and his offers on there I'll be there.
It's just such a shame because th, the one day I knew they were playing it was James ' birthday.
Oh.
And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gon na happen.
Yeah.
And I did n't know they'd done any extra days.
But they added them and nobody told me.
Oh.
I'm not happy!
Are they that good?
Definitely.
Only band I want to see playing in the world.
How far are you up to?
Oh I think I might have finished my tape actually.
No, no, it's still going.
Only got a little bit left.
Oh really?
Yeah.

You're doing it.

Wahey!
The sky's the limit!
I only order water when I'm not paying.
How would you know I'm not paying?
Cos I'm gon na run out of here!
I take it we're leaving pretty quickly?
No I, I had a feeling that I was gon na get landed with the bill there.
Dear oh dear!
It's the reason you came to see me.
I thought it was a matter of going Dutch.
I dunno.
That's only on dates, you're my father.

You.
That does n't count.
Well let's see if I've got any money.
My God!
I think I paid it in.
Makes me laugh!
What a joker, eh?
Mm mm.
But those tender young hands will be plunged in those dishes yet.
I'm used to it.
I do the dishes every day.
Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got a lot less at home than erm.
I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it.
Yeah.
Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over books.
Sure.
Oh.
So.
do n't worry about that.
That'll be their books upstairs.
Ah but it's silly because the thing is, th the they're, well the, th those, th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it!
Oh yeah.
Well that was the room as well that we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there.
There's a massive erm I do n't even know what you call it, of dope like.
Oh yes.
this, er in there because I, I hid that because I mean, I do n't know er like if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me.
Yeah sure.
like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt.
And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this is n't our room.
Oh this is n't our room.
We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it was n't our room as we like took this guy in it was like books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking.
Oh dear!
So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed.
I saw him the other day and he said ah yo, have you, not leaking yet is it from that radiator?
He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just did n't have a clue.
Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there.
You know, like trying to stop it with our finger.
Yeah, sure, yeah.
and it was ju, it was burning our finger.
Yo, yes sure.
And squirting.
And they.
the.
yeah, they had like like three towels.
It's only, it's only a little thing is n't it, in fact, with the thread on?
Yeah, that's what fell out.
Yeah.
I mean, I dunno, obviously it had n't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever.
Undid it too much, yeah sure.
Yes you'd have to be.
And then just it was, it was literally spurting out.
Yeah.
and it, we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's.
No, no, no.
been pumped through.
Pumping through, yeah.
And course it's got, pushing it.
So we still had all this boiling water.
Yeah.
and we did n't think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger.
And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us.
Mm mm.
Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere.
Oh God!
Yeah.
And you got, in the end we just laughed.
And it, it came through to you?
It came through yours?
Yeah.
Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was I suddenly went Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we would n't have realized.
So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off and of course it's not attached.
Oh!
No!
so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward.
Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere!
Oh God!
And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse.
What happened to your word processor?
It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd.
Oh I see.
And then about erm from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi, they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in.
And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face!
Oh no!
Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to.
Oh!
like try and mend that.
Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs.
Oh God!
And then he went into the bathroom locked the door and it was just silent.
And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just did n't hear a thing.
Yeah.
cos we were wo, we all got really worried, we're like, Mark.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wanted a Lemon Delight.
Yeah.
Mm.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Did n't think that looked like a Lemon Delight.
And erm.
Delicious!
Oh!
Wan na take this stuff as a souvenir?
Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah.
Oh.
Great!
Tuck in.
Start.
No that's alright.
It wo n't get cold.
So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm oh it wo n't get cold!
I've just heard what you said.
Oh dear.
I'm on the ball tonight.
Someone is slowing up.
It's getting late.
So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down.
We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright?
And there was no answer.
So we thought I, so we said look, we're gon na have to break it down.
Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like, laugh, you know Mark.
Oh God!
having a laugh on our behalf.
So he came out and we really slapped him hard!
We thought that was.
Oh God!
really out of order.
But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're.
Oh God!
in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out.
And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and he obviously wore himself out and like was having a sleep.
And we're just like, oh God!
And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere.
Oh no!
Oh dear.
And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really sorry state.
He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on.
So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg on this plaster.
And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it trying to get home.
Has he found a place now then or is he.
Yeah, he's gon na be in Isleworth.
Which is quite a way out actually.
It's.
What's.
on the way to.
and he's got ta, he's got ta come into here has he, every day?
Yeah.
Bloody hell!
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight.
So, yeah it's erm I think he's living with Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy.
Oh I see.
He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well.
Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night wo n't you?
Oh eh?
Oh he does it anyway.
I think he'll just crash at our house.
He knows he's.
Yeah.
he's more than welcome to crash at ours.
I mean, it's quite, it's about yeah, I do n't know, he said it's about a forty minute walk or something.
Or a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride.
Oh yes.
Our cycle ride's just about long enough.
And he's, he, he he does n't.
It's get.
drive?
the worst bit is Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway it's sort of like you know, it's like.
Yeah, sure.
Yes.
that is, well that is, and that's like the longest, even.
Mm.
like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit.
Yeah.
Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across basically you're just cutting across.
Oh I see.
Well yo well basically all the ma, there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it.
Mm mm.
And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college.
And that's you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever!
Yeah.
Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die!
There's quite a stretch though there.
Yeah.
You can ca, and it carries on for miles around as well does n't it?
Joining on the motorway bit.
Mm.
Made it for me specially.
Yeah.
Quite nice.
Is it?
It's beautiful.
Mm.
Bombay so, si, er er up there will be out now.
It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into.
Mm.
college so yo, you know, yo whereas at home if you've got the home i, it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car.
Oh sure.
The weather's a bit grotty or you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone.
I do n't mind cycling.
What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much.
Oh, oh ah!
Everything's kept in ovens round here.
In these little Baby Belling type ones.
I wonder how much money they make?
They do pretty well.
Oh yes.
Right.
That's alright.
Lovely, thanks very much.
, I got a brolly as well.
Mm mm.
Take that off.
Go on break it.
Go on.
No, no, no.
I sha n't break it.
There you.
Oh well.
are.
you win it.
No, I'll have to give it to you.
Cheers honey.
Er Mm!
Gorgeous!
Is it?
Mm.
Want a bit?
No I do n't really like not really into those sort of flavours.
You can have my cherry though.
Mm.
What is it, pistachio I might have a bit of pistachio actually.
Nice actually.
It's nice and light.
Beautiful!
So what time do you expect your friends home this evening?
Do n't know.
If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats do n't Shave then I doubt they'll be back till a, about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back if not, tomorrow morning or something.
Mm.
Well they're altogether so I suppose.
Mm.
in that way they're relatively safe.
So do n't sit up worrying about them.
But erm they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway!
Oh yes.
Cos I was gon na go with them and then a, just would have costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like, wai, transport there and transport back.
Blimey!
Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your you know, it'll still be a long night.
Yeah.
But apparently, it's meant to be really good there.
Really good erm like Irish, sort of pub.
Mm.
Pub.
But I would, I will go there sometime.
But I.
Lovely.
Mm.
Is yours alright?
Very nice.
Want a bit?
Oh that's nice.
Something cold and refreshing actually.
Mm.
Cos next, well the week after the reading week we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in.
Oh oh!
Will your transport be laid on or.
I do n't know what, well the I mean it's all paid for so we'd either depending how many people are going away or whatever.
Yeah.
then erm there.
What's.
might be a coach.
If not, apparently, they've worked out how everyone will actually go to school.
So, you'll see.
So I'll just see.
But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out.
Cos also, I do n't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If I'm told to get the whatever bus.
Yeah.
Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at working it out for myself.
Mm.
Would n't have a clue.
But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but I do n't really know.
How often do you that then?
Well the train.
Cos a few people are further out than me so cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth.
Which is like just a se, it's about twenty minutes walk from our houses I think.
Oh.
So it's fine.
Cos loads of us are gon na be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired.
Cos what's, well what's quite good is you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term so we've got a week off.
Mm.
And then we do another four weeks.
Oh.
I think the first week is just sort of basically erm we share with the teacher and only do, say, a couple of lessons a we, couple of lessons a day.
Sure.
and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever.
The, I think, well then after half term then it's more us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after.
Oh I see.
half term.
And what sort of age?
I'm with erm nine and ten years olds.
Mm.
Year five.
Yeah.
I think so.
Oh yeah.
I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before.
Well thump them one will you?
Every time they get cocky, thump them!
Yeah.
I've only taught erm seven and eight year olds.
So it'll be quite an experience.
Mhm.
It's gon na be so exhausting though.
You get, we get assessed on it as well.
Oh well.
You fail those things and you're out basically.
Is there a, is there, is that a fact?
So you really have to have a sort of strong character and in you go.
And so.
Yeah.
Basically lesson pattern stuff.
Cos when we go in after winter break that's when we'll find out er what topics they're doing so we can plan our lessons and.
Oh I see.
fit in with whatever, like their curriculum.
Well if you want anything er er photocopied or put together let me know wo n't you?
Cos I can always sort of.
Yeah.
nip down of a a weekend, collect it and then.
Yeah.
erm bring it back to you.
You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a an evening.
Yeah.
Oh cheers.
Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes.
Yeah.
Cos it's not too bad.
It's really handy.
I, yeah, I do n't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all.
It's a you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a.
Yeah.
rather heavy going.
Well it's so handy though.
It's really like, like a big plus side to it.
Mm.
I mean, especially if James is gon na go in London as well.
Just so much easier to get just to know that if ever like you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour.
Oh sure.
Yeah.
Or people could be up within.
Yeah.
an hour to see me.
Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever to get people up.
Most people that I know have got cars.
Yes.
Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up.
Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so.
Mm.
now he was at Richmond.
And I phoned his house and he did n't phone back.
Oh my God!
He was down the pub.
Beast!
Dear oh dear!
And he does n't even drink!
Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord where we did our er.
Oh yeah.
clay pigeon shooting.
In, he loves it.
Just goes there, chats to the landlord and comes back burning up down the country lanes as he goes.
