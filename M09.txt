Well.
no need to heat them up then.
Keep an eye on the spaghetti.
Any more in there?
How much did I put in?
About two sort of lengths like that.
Bit more, alright.
Well I think what we'll do is one day we'll weigh the amount of spaghetti and then we'll know exactly how much to put in next time wo n't we?
It's alright, I'll finish the tea up.
Yep.
She said that she'd er.
Well you'll po pop and see Bert and Sharon erm.

When I went round there to take the saw back she was er you know her little tail.

Well she was just shaking continuously!
She barked when I first went round there and she just shook and shook so.
Well it's just excitement you know, she hardly does.

Good lord!
Well you'll have to server, cos I ca n't server I'm hopeless at it!
Have you turned the the heat down?
Ah right.
Okay then.

I would have thought you'd be able to heat that stuff up again but Ha!
Phorgh!

No, it's fine!
You're worried about your privacy being invaded are n't you?
Well, there's no need is there?
Ooh, it's hot!

Are you supposed to put hot water over like you do with rice?
Otherwise it's all slimy, is n't it?
Well you should of told me!

Alright.

No drink, no sex Charles!

Get some cash in!
Well that's pretty incidental in the morning.
Cos he's bound, I mean with all that mud and everything, I mean there's lots of sheep droppings and god knows what up there is n't there?
Yeah, I know it still needs treatment but I mean it'll try and get the swelling down a bit.
Well it's hot on.
Mm mm.

Ugh!

Even in three days.
Hello it's only me!
Yeah, I know, the week's gone so quickly that's the trouble!
I'm alright.
Mum about?
Oh right!
I just dropped Sue off.
That was sexist!
Dropped Sue off at erm hairdressers.
Er yeah, I picked her up after work.
Yeah I know.
Yeah.
Hello mum!
Yeah well, I I pick Sue up a bit later and we'll pop round for a cup of tea.
Er er ah no, not yet.
John.
Er.
You started quickly!
No, it's alright.
Been asked to do a survey on the spoken word.
So it's.
just taping conversations, it's.
completely anonymous.
You do n't have to worry about swearing or, Sue swore something terrible in the car this morning!
It's in there.
It's a Walkman but it records and plays and it's got the radio in it as well.
Just down town.
She's having hair cut.
Charlie's done his claw in, said he's got ta go up the vet.
Done his claw in.
Hurt his claw.
No, I use Nicads.
I use Nicads.
They give you twenty tapes to use over the week.
And that's for collecting erm words so that when they do the new dictionary all those words that people use and they do.
Mm.
It's nothing to do with B T!
Well this woman came round last night and asked if I'd take part.
And erm.
Why do you hope?
Well, it's alright when she dresses it.
She puts it up in a bun and things like that.
Mm, jolly good!
Said it's given her a bit more drive again.
Yeah I saw.
them erm.
Not little Cindy, little Zoe!
Not little Cindy!
Probably just thought it was a strange foreigner!
Yeah, that's right!
Was.
Who's erm kid is Zoe then?
Is that erm Sharon's sister's?
Yeah Sharon, erm Zoe and Holly, she's got two girls?
Mm.
I'm just getting through this apple at the moment.
Yep.
I'm da, oh sorry!
I can fish it out.
Here are!
Here are!
Stalk sandwich!
Well, you never know!
Your new job is it?
Are these we, are these erm Irriacs.
Oh lovely!
very neat.
They still using these old rubber thingy you do n't use heatshrink ones?
Ah, there's some Coxes down here, that's brilliant!
You get these from Aston.
yeah.
Mhm.
Oh!
Hello!
Are you alright then?
You look all sleepy.
You just got up?
Oh yeah?
Microphone.
Mm.
I thought I'd be able to get away this, you know!
With all these non-technical people and they're sort of going, what's that?
No it's a microphone, recording conversations.
Everybody.
Well there's two mikes in there.
And they're.
Yeah, like tie mikes and like on Wogan and that sort of thing.
Well everybody's conversations for to build up the new Lo, Longman's dictionary with the new words and things.
No.
Well, all the words, the new words go in the dictionary.

No, this woman came round last night.
Oh, French, mm.
With a, with a Dutch accent!
Yeah!
I carry round, all round with me you see.
Yeah, they put it all in a computer and then all the words are analyzed and from the different accents and all that sort of, pronunciation.
Well if you take part, if you're asked!
No, I I mean I was on the phone and th, there was a knock at the door and this woman came round and said she was from from the.
Yeah.
Well it's very nice of you but we're gon na got ta go to Plaistowe cos of Charlie's claw you see?
And the surgery's only for an hour so.
I must pop round one evening next week.
The week's gone so quickly I've just been sort of, you know.
Oh yeah.
Well Sue's away next week as well you see.
That's already in the dictionary.
they're looking for words that are n't in there!
No.
I'm more worried about the glass!
Mm, twenty five pound gift voucher.
Which I was n't told, she said twenty five pounds, so I thought ah, it'll do nicely!
Help top up the bank a bit!
No, I think it's probably for Longmans.
It's probably a book, it's.
probably a book token!
Or something.
I do n't mind.
You can er, it's got a radio, the radio's brilliant!
I mean, you can walk, you could.
you can move around, I was sa, wearing it in the kitchen yesterday, you can move around and it's er.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah, well what you do is they give you a sheet of paper and th, you write down who was involved in the conversation, so all I'd say is, is erm Mum.
Dad, or John, Elly or or something like that.
I th I mean they're not interested in actual names, so if there's two Johns they put John one and John two.
That's the sort of idea.
So that if.
if they listen on another tape all the.
Well I just we, rewind it and then tape over.
it.
Like if I, if if you know if you say, oh I object to this, then I'd just turn it off and rer rer erase it.
I was quite funny yesterday.
cos I had it running in the kitchen while we were cooking tea last night and Sue came in and goes a real big fart, and goes oh I have n't been able to fart all week, she says!

Yeah.
Yeah, it's a nice bed and breakfast.
She's got her own ensuite and er.
chap brings her a cup of tea at nine o'clock.
No, I think she was getting chatted up by the bloke who owned the place, really!
Some chap runs it with his wife.
Well I'll pick her up.
about quarter to and I'm coming back here.
Oh God, I've still got the dogs in the car, hang on!
Can I just dump them, dump them in the shed quickly?
I wo n't bring them in here, put them in round back.
Can you get one?
Have n't got any shoes on.
I'll be back in a minute.
She said she was from the.
Well it's sort of like market research type type idea.
Cor!
If only!
Just a week.
Well I dunno whether I'll be able to use at work you see, I'll have to ask the the governor.
They probably will but.
if they do well there's not a lot we can do about it really.
Course it's working!
No!
The sound comes over on what?
On the machine, you mean?
Oh yeah!
Well it's got automatic level control on it.
On the recording.
Well it just looks at the the signal level coming in and adjusts the gain accordingly.
Oh no, that'll just shut down the gain and this.
probably still come out clear, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah but it's completely anonymous, and no one's gon na know I'm talking to you are they?
Well it's beg it's to get the words in everyday conversation.
is n't it!
Ha!
Well they're not gon na know!
They're not they're not, that's already been done has n't it?
They've already, this is a commercial machine this thing, you buy them down at Dixon's.
No!
Well, have you been using Daz Automatic recently!
Oh, dear oh dear!

Oh nobody's gon na talk about that with this are they!
Well they would n't be carrying a bloody great mike like that.
round would you!
You ca n't, cos if it goes inside your jumper it ge, the sound all gets muffled.
They have to be on the outside right, cos as soon as it goes through a piece of material you'll lose all the high frequency to it.
Do n't you?

Yeah.
This bloody great hole the next day there!
Do it.
I had to laugh though cos I was talking chap at work and they'd sent round this erm this form right, to fill in about your opinion about the company and everything.
And said, so it's completely anonymous and all that and he said oh I ca n't be bothered to send that in, so he chucked it in the bin and they phoned him up and said why have n't you sent your form in?

Oh yeah.
Yeah, and then an can he then can you trust the staff?
No, I'll get you sheet of paper on erm what it's about.
Oh I did n't bring it with me, I've only got my record book.
But the idea is.
you fill out a little sheet of paper with the, with the names like John A, John B or whatever, so that if there's another tape and you've marked John B and they missed a word, or what what the word was and they there's a chance that they might use it again later on you see.
Yeah.
Put down, the Buckingham Palace!
Ha!
You've heard of Longmans have n't you?
The printers?
Publishers.
It's the Longman's er, Dictionary.
Oh mum, mum's always.
had a suspicious mind has n't she?
I do n't know, maybe they erm a, they'll listen to the tapes and they probably sample some of the words into a computer to build up a database of words that probably like you said, oh he's getting a lot of jip from his boss, you know, is probably not in the dictionary but if a lot of people said that word then they would.
Yeah, that's right.
That's why it's best not to tell people that you're doing it you see because then they they're careful what they say.
You know.
I mean, they might but it'll be a classic.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ooh!
Ooh my ear!
Did you get that?
Yeah.
Well I'll, I'm going up to the vet so I'll leave it running when we're in the vet.
Cos it's all different.
No.
They're the headphones.
So you can play back and listen, make sure it's come out alright.
Yeah.
Well it's no big deal really is it?
Just a case of taking the tape deck around and if you're not having a conversation yo you can use the radio so I'm not really worried.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yep.
And twenty tapes which you erm you do n't have to use all them just you know, fill what you can.
No, you just give them back.
Mm.
Are they confidential?
Go on then.
A tarmac?
Oh T-ach.
Tarmac!
Yeah.
You wo wo n't be able to record a lot of music on it though.
Go on.
then.
Multi-track.
Yeah.
No.
No, I was sixteen down the studio was n't I?
I got four track.
Four track on half inch.
Was it a cassette base or erm a reel to reel?
Pete, who's Pete?
I do n't remem.
I do n't remember Pete.
Peter?
Oh right!
Yeah, yeah!
The one who was in erm good lord!
I ca n't keep track!
What the one who's er off round the world and oil rigs or something.
Yeah.
Is he a musician then?
Yeah?
Oh oh!
There's quite a lot of second hand if he's willing to travel around for them.
Depends what he wants.
But I mean er you can get cassette based ones which are quite cheap and cheap to run cos you just use, you know, good quality metal tapes and you get four tracks I think they even make a six track one now, or an eight track.
Erm.
Er Norwich Road.
Cor I'm gon na have to, I'm gon na have to go soon!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, the surgery's at half eleven till half twelve so we pop back here for a quick cup of tea and I want to go up to Felixstowe.
Cos Charlie, you know, keeps digging rabbits up and he's knackered his claw!
Cor yeah!
Sounds good!
Oh right.
Yeah, well we would stay but the, the surgery's only an hour you see, that's the trouble.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Well, Sue's hurt her shoulder cos she was carrying her bag on the train you know coming back from Birmingham.
Well, women they must pack the whole wardrobe do n't they?
Right, have a massage, yeah.
Did I?
Oh, yeah well better her standing than me really!
Cos the car's bigger.
Erm.
, on the Norwich Road, might be one.
!
Yes.
And there's they might do the machine.
But the mainly keyboards but's your best bet.
They do quite a lot of stuff in there.
They'll definitely have something.
Waste of money though.
Better give me some then!
I'll sell him my machine for five hundred quid.
Well it's a bloody great thing innit?
Half inch tapes at twenty five pound a reel for the tape.
Whereas cassette.
you can, you know.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Righto, I'll be off in a bit then!
How long was I then?
Oh give me a break!
Yeah well I did n't wan na have to sit here waiting for you, cos I know you every time you say oh so and so.
I mean.
as far as I was concerned you might have been in there another fifteen minutes!
Anyway I got chitter-chattering with mum and dad.
Must chuck the dogs in the shed for a bit.
As the frame came down and Bunny, came out and Bunny was sitting in the driver's seat again!
Pest!
They spotted the mike straight away you know!
So I'm never gon na get away with it at work am I?
Oh no, what I mean is I'm not gon na be able to get away without people.
knowing.
Do I wan na go this way or go up round?
Have n't had a chance to look yet.
I'm just trying to get past these cars.
Well that's why Lucy's so.

Mum's making a cup of tea and a nice piece of chocolate cake.
Your cheeks are cold again.
Oh yeah!

No one's gon na build anything.
They fenced what?
Yeah.
Oh shit!
Yeah, but he does n't own the bit behind us does he?

Felt guilty as hell the first time I went on there!
Well that's me all over is n't it?
Not for the first time.
No, it was the day we went to get Bunny I think was n't it?
The day you went to get Bunny and I had terrible hay fever.
Yeah.
Er.
Right, come on then!
Ding dong!
Oh it's quite good, to stop people tripping over.
Cos.

Have you bought a new set John?
You used to have.

Oh!
Quite a successful game really is n't.

You would n't mind the royalties for that anyway!
The other co, other things come and go but.
Scrabble goes on forever.

Well use.
Blu-tac or something ca n't you?
Mm.
Well ca n't they paint it straight on in the mi, on the ceiling?
Well like, remember that programme we saw when they they did that thing for the kiddies ' hospital did n't they?
Er Anneka Rice thing.
and she erm they got these.
people in to paint all the corridors, this place was really dowdy was n't it?
All.
Mm.
What are they?
Oh, apples!
I thought they were potatoes!
Oh well done!
Whoosha!
Thank you.
No, I just dropped it.
Come on Sue, grub up!

That's yours.
There you go.
Splendid!
Oh, butter!
I've got it over here, it's alright.
Cor, finish me!
There's half a.
banana for you.
Do n't eat it all!
Bet that was painful!
Well it's just that dad said he passed a great big piece of wood, I said that must have been painful!
Any excuse!
It's like the er the honey and the.
and the su and the stuff.
Yeah, so we're gon na have a dossy day today.

There's people with dogs down here all the time are n't they?
They've all got little rugs on!
Keep them warm?
Oh no, no no, no, no, they're not gon na have ponies or football!
If our kids wan na go to the football it'll be well erm.
go and do a paper round and you can go then ca n't you?
Got nowhere to put them anyway!
I would n't, erm, I would n't have er horses or ponies unless we had.
couple of acres at least to put them on.
Bon!
Stables at the bottom of our garden?
We could always ask Scott if we could put them on!
Chestnut?
Oh what the er well would they.
well I supp.
Oh yeah!
Do you reckon she would er.
Oh right!
So they're not all her horses then?
Oh I did n't reali, I thought they were all hers.
So what does she do just maintain the stables?
They so, cos they bi, built some new stables did n't they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cor!
A thousand quid, you've got ta be joking!
They nick your car away.
Yeah but if the key's not in there and you turn the wheel it locks in straight away anyway!
Or you could do an Arnold Schwarzenegger, just go break the lock!
Possibly.
Well you're still in third.
Well you wo n't you spoilt it.
Look out a car.
Cor that's seen some service!
It was knackered!
Did you see it?
Shot away.
It's time to get in the bath again.
I know, nice though.
Are we gon na be here all day now then?
Right.
When has Charlie got ta start on his pills then?
Right.
This car is a mess!
Yeah, you'll be driving this one well I'll have a new one.
I'm the one who deserves a new one I've been driving around in a van for three years!
Wait!
No, you're gon na have this one, you're gon na.

Chas, here, wait!
Well, I'm just concerned about cats in there.
Wait!
Wait!
Wa You got the key Sue?
You got ta lock the boot up.
You've got to lock the boot.
The boot you've got ta lock!
Alright.
Oh dear!
Wait!
This do, gate's jamming is n't it?
Ah dear!
It's so swollen.
Hello trouble!
We're coming in.
It's freezing.
in there.
Hello Derek.
Yeah.
More money!
More bills!
Check my shoes.
This.
He's a hooligan!
Well, when you think how much they must earn in an hour cos Sue was only in there ten minutes!
So it's twelve pound, well I mean that's the tablets.
More bills, more money see what I mean!
Splendid!
Sue's gon na make one when we get home so that'll be two apple.
pies!
Can I have a drink?
I'm gasping!
Can I have some of this grape juice?
Oh it's already open that's alright.
Apple pie, ha!
Er well it's gone on very quickly actually.
I've just.
erm.
Yeah, it's amazing, you get home take the dogs get them their food, have some tea, and it's sort of half past eight you know.
Go on.
Yeah, fo was hoping to get more done but ooh that's.
funny!
I just played around in my studio a bit really and.
watched the telly and.
do a bit of O U and se about it really, ha!
And it's Friday again.
Mum an, mum and dad expected me to come up last week.
Some time in the evening and er.
I just er did n't get round to it.
No!
As I say, if you by the time you get home and then you got to exercise them erm and then you've got to get back and feed them and then feed yourself and keep warm and think of you know, what you got to wear the next day the time's gone!
That's right, and I've.
I got the er pen finished off on Sunday.
Yeah.
Cut a hole in the shed and.
and erm.
you know, got them a.
bit of soft yeah!
I mean they've kept it re really clean!
I mean, I have n't had to clean it out at all.
You know, so they obviously think it's like the floor in the house you know.
Which is quite handy.
It's a lot neater and we've cut the door down to size so that.
and er ooh it's an.
Erm yeah cos you know before we had the fence and then there was a gate which was quite tall?
And I've cut.
I've cut a bit off that, about a quarter of it.
so it's the same height as the fence and.
put all the posts in.
We've got loads of fencing left.
which we're gon na put along the top of the house.
Then we.
can grow some so honeysuckle or something up it.
That's right.
Pastry making, eh?
Poor old Sue was absolutely whacked when she got home last night!
Yeah.
Just crashed out!
I did the tea.
she wanted to watch this film, I said no you do n't get into bed you know?
She was asleep within ten minutes.
And she's full of beans again this morning.
Yeah, it's er.
been getting pretty technical.
She was telling me a bit about it.
All these new sort of, genetic techniques and stuff.
like that.
Bit beyond me!
Mm.
Well she said it's given her a new sort of er zest for the job, you know.
Doing this course.
How long have people been making pastry for?
How long have people been making pastry?
Years and years.
And then you, fill up the holes do you?
Oh when I used to think when I was a kid and the stuff I used to eat, you know there's.
uncooked pastry and.
and I erm and and clean out.
the bowl when mum made a cake.
Ah!
I think that's disgusting now!
Ugh!
Mm.
But you like a lot of sweet things when you're a kid do n't you?
Got some flour on the table.
What's all this paint doing here?
You been painting something?
Oh you got er.
Matchpots have you, or something?
Mm mm.
Mhm.
I'm tired now mate.
Yeah.
Looks good!
Yeah.
That's true.
Well I'm gon na, tell them later.
Hello.
Just passing thought we'd pop in.
Like your motor Spen!
Yeah smart!
Do n't wan na wan na swop it for an Astra do you?
Oh no, not ill!
Watching videos are you?
Idle!
Hello boysie!
It's just the wife eh?
Hey!
Quite a nice thingy innit?
Yeah, it's alright that.
Before?
Bit iffy was it?
Different.
Oh that's right, all double and thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's nothing about these days is there?
That's one of the reasons we did n't bother we just painted it, you know?
Cos it's a pain hanging it!
Nice though.
Is this painted wood?
Or is it er.
Fibreglass, or something like that.
Yeah.
Oh it's nice and clean is n't it?
Clean.
Yeah, yeah.
They were all made up as a batch were n't they?
Yep.
They look good!
What was it like before you moved in then?
Oh Christ!
Have you put all the coving up?
Or is that theirs?
No we're gon na do.
Right.
Oh right!
Oh I see.
yeah.
Mm.
Mm!
It's quite a room, size.
You're gon na put a table here are you?
Oh that's right.
Pretty good!
Save you having to wash up!

Yeah, it's quite popular the old dishwashers now.
Mm.
Had a worried look on her face then!
Bonnie's face!
That's another week.
Look like you was just about to say something then!
It's open.
It's open.
Yeah, I did n't see it before.
Green?
Ugh!
Oh!
Well the front here this is green going up the front is n't it?
Yeah.
What you gon na do with the garden then?
Yeah.
Aha.
Aha.
So you're gon na have, you're gon na have get rid of the lawn at the front then effectively?
Yeah.
Are you gon na put another garage up or just.
wo n't bother?
Yeah, that's true.
You take this up?
Oh it's had all new windows put in some time has n't it?
Yeah.
Oh you got a little shed!
And some veggies!
Are these leeks?
or or.
bolted onions!
What the hell are they?
The bed.
Are they cabbages or something?
Red cabbage.
Yeah?
Yeah, once you get that shed and that garage down you can er.
be quite.
decent, yeah.
Have you been watching that gardening programme?
Friday evenings.
Oh!
They've had some good ideas though.
Yeah.
Yeah, Sue Sue wants it.
o over a weekend do n't you?
Ah yeah.
And they build up the old.
Yeah.
What you gon na do on the floor?
No!
Ah that's er lovely.
is n't it?
Yeah!
Got a real sort of er.

That's amazing is n't it?
How people.
with chi, er tastes are different?
Are you gon na keep this, keep this as well are you?
Well quite!
Got a decent so you're gon na have this as a dining room are you?
Lovely!
Yeah, do n't do n't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean.
Are you gon na be able to get some more from the manufacturer to.
to patch that bit up are you?
What was that, an old.
gas fire thingy was it?
Mm.
Yeah, yeah got a glimpse.
of that.
Nice and warm.
That's actually gas is n't it?
Yeah, Derek was saying about it.
You're not tape to taping are you?



Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think.
Or video, no, video.
output to video input.
Yeah, it's nice that!
It's convenient is n't it?
Switch it on and.
Well one measures volts and one measures amps!
Yeah.
An amp amps is current, and volts is volts!
Well basically with a with a volt meter.
you put the the volt meter across the voltage you're measuring say, like a battery, right.
got a battery, put the volt.
across it.
and you measure volts, okay?
Well that tells you the voltage of the battery at that particular.
time, yeah?
But.
amp meter you put in series say, like if you put a light bulb across.
the battery you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then the other.
lead of the bulb would go through.
the meter.
Does that ma.
So it'd go from the, from the battery.
If we go from the battery to the bulb, from the bulb to the meter.
from the meter to the battery, yeah.
And that measures current.
Why's that then?
Is that something you're teaching the kids are you?
No.
You've got ta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter or a current meter across a battery you're effectively shorting the battery out.
Right?
Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a a volt meter's got a a hun, a high er resistance or an open circuit, effectively.
No.
Amp meter across the battery.
Yeah.
Yeah, the current would flow.
but you would get a lot of current flowing.
Depends what the what the a, I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps and you stuck it across a battery.
the meter would go smack across the thing!
But if you have it set to to amps.
then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of.
See what I mean?
So you've got ta be a bit careful!
Yeah.
Well when they.
Oh I'll be out in a minute.
Erm if you the thing is, yo a battery might be marked nine volts.
but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts.
Yeah, well it's dead yeah but what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever got it's operating and stops working.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, it'd be dead.
Yeah.
Well no, your volt me, I use volt meters all the time at work.
You make, build a circuit if you.
wan na test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure cos if you think.
Well they.
You just wan na measure the volt, it's just a test meter is n't it?
I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work and you just turn a knob and it's got ohms, volts, amps frequency you know, whatever.
Yeah.
I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it.
See what I mean.
It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand.
what's what.
Oh it came yesterday did it?
Oh she's sitting in it already.
Oh.
I'll have a quick shake, shufty.
Well the si, the back door's open innit?
Yeah, so you can close it.
Station please!
Cor this is nice innit?
First time.
I've been in one of these.
Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes smack!
The beam would be on a stick would n't it?
It's on one of the sticks.
Oh it's nice.
is n't it?
Oh, sun roof as well.
Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle.
of the lights.
It changes the two.
Nifty, what?
Is that for the mirrors?
Oh god!

I would n't!

Well you took your dad out did n't you?
The steering lock on?
We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow!
How long have you been waiting for this car, a while have n't you Spen?
How many valves has it got?
Got sixteen valves has it?
Oh.
Oh that's sickly is n't it?
That is really smart innit?
They probably have a big.
whole department working on these ashtrays and then.
Yeah.
Oh that's brilliant that!
Yeah.
I'm surprised it has n't got a digital one actually.
No.
For actually glancing down and looking at a clock.
a.
dial one is is actually easier to read is n't it?
What's sa what's the hi-fi like then?
Oh yeah, yeah.
Vandal-proof job.
you see.
You pull them thing out do you.
Yeah.
A chauffeur key!
That's your job then Sue!
I like these seatbelts at the back!
They come from the other way.
do n't they?
Yeah.
That's good actually.
Oh course.
yeah!
Never thought of that.
Good old Gerries.
ah?
It's got a lovely, lovely gear box has n't it?
Gear stick on that.
Mm.
How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you wound it up?
Oh course, yeah!
Oh cos you only got it yesterday did n't you?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, very impressive is n't it?

Yeah we saw that in the Radio Times.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh I would of gone.
I would of gone for the four wheel.
definitely!
Yeah but trouble is you pray for ra, pray for snow when you've got a four wheel drive car!
God.
snow, look!
Yeah.

I wish he had n't of got it cos Sue wants it when he's finished with it.
I do n't like floppy gearboxes.
I like a nice a positive!
Mm.
Just about in the ground now innit really?
It sounds like a diesel engine so.

Yeah, it's all the on the roads innit?
No I do n't!
You wanted the Sierra!
Oh!

Mm.
Yeah, th they had a new, a re-think.
Mm.
Mm.
Well, well Mike did n't have one cos he was too tall!
And he kept banging his head on the ceiling!
So he did n't have one.

He said, what do I want another bloody car for!
So.

Yeah, I'll enjoy that.
They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there!
Mm.
But you can save a.
lot going to the auction ca n't you?
Bit of gamble a though!
Not all of them are the high mileage though are they?
Yeah, a fleet car.
Mm.
But they shift.

You do n't get time to think about it.
It's like in.
That was in mint condition was n't it?
It was an F, F reg was it?
Was it E?
Yeah.
Well that's cos it was a van you see.
Well a van for us would be ideal would n't it?

That's a innit?
Yeah.
No you have to be really careful.
No if you if you buy a different make of, some of them stick out further and they foul it.
We've had this problem before.
So it's best just to be er on the safe side.
A lot more than you do with me.
probably, yeah.
Tell you what,.
Tell you what, it's bloody tempting to take a couple of days off work just to burn.
I'm d I've never been this excited over a bike before.
Yeah.
Well I have n't yet, I have n't picked it up yet.
Yep.
Oh it's so quick to go between now is n't it?

Done all that.
While you've been fart-arsing around around the labs.
somewhere I've done it all.
Fucking hell.
Now there's a reason why I've got this view up at the moment, alright.
I was gon na give it to Ian to take to college tonight, but he's not in so I ca n't, so I've got ta send it now but I ca n't address.
Lost it.
Do n't know her number.
Do n't know her name.
All I know is her name's Barbara.
Yeah she lives in Felixstowe, but I do n't know what her surname is.
Have to go and see George and see if he's er if he's got her number somewhere.
I know I have to go down the college tonight.
She might.
Oh, bloody hell.
Oh hang on, hang on.
I might have left it here might n't I?
Ah!
No.
Just the Thing is we get so much crap through the post right, that er.
No.
Yeah.
Is there a list of the erm the tutors in the handbook or anything?
It's what?
Whole course, yeah.
Yeah, whole country, yeah.
Oh, bloody.
No I've looked.
It's not at home as far as I can see.
I've definitely got one cos I remember her sheet now as I was looking at it, but where it is I'm buggered if I know.
No.
Do you want one then?
Here, you can have, that reminds me I've got ta do that label have n't I?
Which one do you want?
That one's got lines in it.
Squares as well.
Dunno why so keen on bloody squares.
Is that for erm?
What a loan book?
Oh.
Bosch.
Bosch.
Hotpoint.
You get crap machines and you get problems mate.
That's to be expected is n't it?
Is that because it's full of chalk or is it cos.
You what?
Your?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mhm.
Yeah but they're er so well made you sh should n't really need to have to change it very often.
Ah!
Yeah.
It's not as deep as some others then you mean?
Chop a hole in the back.
In the wall at the back.
Mm.
Well they never make things er bombproof do they?
Cos if your washing machine machine lasts for thirty years they'd go out of business would n't they?
Consumer society, you see?
Mhm.
How long you had this thing then?
And it's conked out?
Ah.
So it has n't actually failed, it's just not up to scratch.
Yeah but surely that comes under the warranty then.
If it's not doing its job that it's intended to do.
Oh.
Oh.
So the parts are free but the labour's a hundred.
pound an hour.
Bloody hell.
Well ca n't you fix it yourself?
Just take the back off and and you've only got to undo a couple of clips and take the pump off.
You're just idle.
No, you get, well, do you have to have it serviced to get the the free part then?
Do they only give you free parts under warranty if it's serviced with a?
It's a rip-off is n't it?
Well, yeah I do.
It's a.
part.
Well you bl slam it on the counter and say bloody you know, look in there it's got crap in it, it's not working.
Mm.
Looks like you've got pig in a poke mate.
You've got a water softener as well have n't you?
Mm.
So the pump's working but not works properly.
So why ca n't you take the part Is it all a sealed unit that you ca n't get the pump apart?
Mm.
If it was me I'd just take the bloody thing out and have a look at it.
Lock them in the other room.
Mm.
Dunno what's her name is.
She phoned me up at home on a Sunday, asking.
if I was gon na come down to college,.
and I said erm No.
Mm.
Did you make that mess there?
Who made that mess?
We'll have to get a camera on that tea point to see who's making the mess.
In my old group, they just took it upon themselves to clean it every now and again.
Trouble is with this group, nobody gives a fuck.
They just sort of.
Mm.
Mm.
Why was she sticking her nose in anyway?
Get in early there if you want.
Mm.
You get your own now anyway do n't you?

Yeah.
Nail your arse to the seat.
Twin Peaks.
Yeah.
She said I ca n't.
Stupid git.

She sits there and answers the telephone basically.
And comes and moans about her marriage.
Mm.
She brings it down when she's doing something else.
Oh erm Shirley.
Daphne.
Mm.
Mm.
Well times I receive a fax I just keep going up there and bothering them until they say it's gone through.
Mm.
Is that why they've got a fax machine then?
Mm.
The whole idea of erm a fax is to get the thing there quickly is n't it? if it's sort of sitting up on a desk for three days before they bring it down.
Mm.
Talking about faxes.
What's the number for that one, anyway?
Mm.
Mm.
Never know, you might have won something.
Congratulations, you have won a holiday to Canada.
That'd be nice would n't it?
I have registered.
I know.
They just leave them in the post room do n't they?
Mm.
It's only cos they're too idle to cart these catalogues and things about.
The trouble is, people register for er with them because they they're offering.
a free pen or something like that.
They do sometimes.
Mm.
Mailsort.
Mm.
Yeah the amount of crap I get through the place you would n't believe it.
All different titles.
Doctor and erm er Head of Research and er things like that you know?
They're just guessing.
Oh yeah.
P C magazines and stuff.
Oh shit.
How am I gon na get her bloody number then?
If I sent that today it'd be there Wednesday morning would n't it?
If I put first class on here.
Fuck.
He's on leave.
The only day I actually wan na see him and the bastard's on leave.
As far as I know, yeah.
Oh, how did I do that?.
I'm sure George has got it actually.
Oh, bloody hell.
It's just one little slip of paper in an envelope, and they always send it separately.
They never send it with the.
Well they did n't this year.
It came in a small erm small envelope.
It did.
Cos I remember, I remember picking it up and reading it, I was out in the garden at the time.

It's it's the en, the end of his football career.
No, playing football.
Got the.
Yeah there was somebody doing that.
Like a.
Could n't bloody steal that one!
I assume in some ways.
Who?
Yeah.
We got letter.
You put the letter in.
And we got, hah!
Now what's she done?
These are the.
Erm.
off move.
and then go re-draw.
and then do a.
Here we go!
with it.
Here we go!
Fix so you want to convert M to millimetres?
I go in with the old one as well, right?
Here?
Be writing all the letters by here.
Oh right!
I had to add a bit on the bottom here Bedge.
Feel much better now.
I just thrown something at the erm.
Right!
Now where are we?
Okay.
Okay.
It's nought point five.
Ooh I've!
Yep.
Ought point eight five.
Yeah, I dunno why.
And it's nought point O one.
nought point nine five.
Yeah, point zero.
Yes.
is one point O three.
One po, one point three L's on here.
No,.
Right, where's K?
Wonder if K's got it.
up there now.
K, probably does n't exist now.
Leave it on there.
L.
Ca n't see any other K's on there.
No, lea leave it in.
Do the whole list again.
Right?
L?
Non-plated.
As it is, it's three point eight.
Did I say two point eight.
Yeah, but I mean were they all on the?
T's.
Er sixty.
OMT's again.
It's round here.
I still.
do n't know what he's doing, he's probably got a or something.
No, they're.
Two point fives.
L, yeah, it could do.
Yeah, that's bigger than one point three though is n't it?
Yeah, that is a huge space three points.
Oh sorry, did I say two point eight?
Yeah.
Yes that's what it is.
Well, what we'll do we we'll fill these out right and then we'll do a plot info then we got ta find out what actually he has used.
No, got ta cancel, go on!
Cos what it does, it remembers tools tool holes that used to be on there.
It's a bit of a pain!
No point in saving it.
Just write it on a bit, bit of paper.
On there.
Have n't got any little cards have you?
No, the guy was the just filling the bar one up.
No.
Sorry about this..
Post?
Should do.
Shoo,!
Mm mm.
That's a photo plot.
Is there a plot info now?
. Now quick on erm grid.
the plot yet.
They go there.
Go there.
I see.
Make your way up.
Right, and let's do one on the other one as well.
Right then.

It smelt strange in here but I were n't sure if it was my fish paste sandwich or not!
Just got a whiff as soon as you walked up then!
Second time I've been able to smell that.
I reckon them wo working on them laser, the solder iron.
Ooh!
Mm.
Have a look at your terminal window, come on.
Click, click, clicking!
You clicking?
I'm picking.
I'm clicking!
I just put your on.
No, you're doing the morse or something!
I hate David!
is not right.
Got it!
I'll remember that..
Just telling you.
Cor!
Lovely!
Right, there's only six.
Fucking asking him!
Ahhhh get off!
Yeah!
Yeah.
You bastard!
!
Yeah.
Spondoolies.
Oh.
yeah!
Yeah, th he used to be he used to be a watchmaker or clock er mender, watcher whatever you call it!
How big's fifty?
Well if you think about it.
is.
Yeah, it's about one point two five, yeah.
And then.

I do n't reckon you'll fit on there to.
be honest!
Where?
You're not bloody!
It's the managers only!
They're probably is n't one!
And then look for.
You know the easiest way do n't you?
No.
Fill out a drill template with just the K hole in it.
That'd be quicker.
Find hole.
Why do n't you put in there, this one.
suggest.
Now just say output.
It's because you said there was one hole, but there's two that's what it probably means.
Oh yeah!
Well that's what I did mine as.
thousand from two make mine.
One point yeah, one point two five.
Put.
One point five.
Three hundred?
Oh wha, it is a big hole is it?
Well thirty is.
Three hundred I got.
Yee ahhh.
Ah!
Equals.
I told you!
I did!
I said seven point five!
Break, go for a break.
And bloody that's mine!
Oh right.
They're mine, you cheeky bastard!
Well Paul do n't mind, he'll give them straight back to me you fucking idiot!
No!
No, if I did it.
He did n't.
Are you gon na do his appraisal?

No, I have n't been counselled.
I wan na counselled.
So where's my counselling?
Come on!
I could do with a laugh!
Paul's not gon na do them all is he?
Paul?
Unless they do a mass one,.
together.
We're all fucking useless alright?
He's had his.
Had his already.
Who did your then?
What do you get?
What do you get?
Oh you bastard!
Why?
I think the sun shines out of my bottom!
Sort out of them which ones you do n't want.
Yeah.
V T H then.
No it's not!
It's not!
Okay.
I'll have that one that one okay, E.
And the problem is.
You need.
a nought point eight five.
What are you trying to do?
What are you doing?
Well hang on a sec, cos you've got ta get the letters translated, it depends what's in your drill template dunnit?
Fucking hell!
Hang on a sec, look, look, look!
All we've got ta do, alright, is that list of holes that are actually on the board alright?
These are the ones the what's it's given us alright?
Drill template.
So we'll start with twenty we've we want twenty thirty three exists thirty five exists.
Alright?
Well hang on a sec let's let's just see which ones we need.
Four, thirty seven.
Small one.
Well you, you be going through and just tick off which just stroke a line through the ones we do n't want.
Right, how you doing?
Right, that's good.
Right, so we're using all the others are we?
Excellent!
Yeah.
What you'll have to do in here right, because E and F you'll still have to have E and F alright?
But quoted as the same size alright?
Oh right, sorry!
That's I me, erm F and H.
Make them both point nine five then.
Well cos you got this lot wrong did n't you?
You did all the letters wrong.
Well you took them off that did n't you?
I know.
Well only cos F is in there now.
Well that's probably where I'm wrong.
Make.
Go on you can work it out!
This is.
They're all in.
Right.
We got it all written down look.
As long as your drill template tallies with this alright?
And you do n't miss out any letters that occur except for the L, right?
Cos we wo n't have any L's right?
So occur on that, right?
You ne you need two.
Yep!
Yep!
Yep!
No.
Keep, you'll have to keep the letter because that letter will come up alright?
So.
Yeah.
I mean, for instance, make erm make F nought point nine five as well.
Alright?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay?
Unfortunately!
I'm gasping for!
Just a bit.
Dunno why! any more does he?
Yeah, it effects me like that when I drink really cold drink.
Windsor!
Oh he wo n't be in school will he?
It's half term.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ee ee.
Does that mean the er Barbara.
I know it.
I'll know the address cos old law do n't do thirty five a week.
Half three but.
you'd be better of posting it at a post box when you go cos they pick them up.
Do n't forget push him to.
Yep!
Yep!
The er people that pay the bills say oh well that's no good to us!
What is the use of having this wonderful.
Web system.
when they do n't fucking look at it!
Precisely!
But they're a, they're a law.
unto themself!
They still want a paper system!
They still want me to send paper work to say it.
Which we do all that anyway, always do.
They're fucking useless!
I do!
Tough!
Circuit boards and tough!
I know!
Well it bloody should do!
Yeah.
I will just fill out what she wants me to do.
They'll probably end up paying twice for it.
Because I recko, I reckon they must of been paid for that because Maury has n't been phoning up and saying oh you have n't paid it!
She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know there is a sort of a problem.
I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us.
Cos it's got my name on there.
She'd know it was me who got it.
Well it's not one of these weirdos!
What?
Yes.
Yeah, you're telling me!
But, you said you only wanted four lines!
Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one drawing!
Ah!
Yeah.
Why do n't you do a Mark.
Ah, cos there's an extra vire there is there?
We should of done these before we erm.
Yeah, but you've still got ta do it.
You still got ta move stuff around ai n't you?
Tidy it up.
Yeah.
Yeah, but then if you run this your ri.
Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there?
By the time you've you've moved them all rather than drawing them all in again then you run the con activity and swop back.
Cos you're gon na have to run con activity anyway.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
No.
Hang on sec, I'll just look in.
There.
So it's between it's just on that bit there?
S.
I was looking for the same thing yesterday!
Yeah.
Cos I er you know she sent a thing, well I you know you sent the thing with the address and I.
well I lost it!
Okay.
I had to get si, see I was gon na give it to you.
She we.
Yeah, ah well no, I could n't find you and erm Mick said you were on leave so I had to send it, and I did n't have the address so I had to go and ge, see George.
Can you hang on a minute, Bedge?
It's in my briefcase.
Well it's just a pose really innit?
Now erm ol lol lol where are we?
No it's not a.
I have got it.
I have got it.
Oh!
Should be able to remember it, it's erm Barbara.
and it's erm yeah, have n't got a postcode though.
I'm sure it'll get there.
That's the trouble really innit?
No, apparently.
yo, racialism is the worst part!
Ta, talking to other people who've done the course.
Have you watched the programme?
Watched the programme?
It's good!
Yeah.

As long as you can er it back.
Cos what I'm doing, I put them on a series and keeping them for revision.
Oh.
It's this Saturday.
You can borrow it as long as you promise to bring it back.
Yeah, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I better take the tab out the video otherwise he'll erase it!
Not that I do n't trust him or anything!
Yeah.
Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected wo n't it?

I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else.
Something.
Oh we're on that now are we?
I thought it was the tester yesterday.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh God!
Wish you boys would make your minds up!
One minute it's one thing, and then it's another!
No.
No.
They had er he forgot to video the programmes, so he's got ta borrow my video.
And he did n't have the address either he's lost his sheet!
Rep.
I call mine.
No.
No, it's not.
It's very good actually!
Oh, cracks me up, cos of it does n't.
it does n't erm develop if you like, it always stays the same.
So they show all these really old videos and these guys.
are walking round with flared trousers and things!
Brilliant!
This guy, his flares must of been sort of.
Yo you remember it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Quite old, yeah.
Yeah, a tie you could make a suit out of!
What?
Ah go.
Well just click on the on pop-up so you get a a new a new window.
Oh, you shoved it up sc, oh!
Well put er, hit fault.
Default.
Shut up!
Too late!
Oh it's brilliant innit!
There you go.
We we'll laugh!
That's brilliant!
Exactly the same problem again!
Oh God!
Too late!
No.
Yeah, just about.
Well when he pisses off I can put the radio on ca n't I!
Well I ca n't hear what he's saying then can I?
No, he says it too late!
Should always say it like at least half a second earlier.
Yeah I know.
They're all the with er Eric.
Yeah, but you really should I mean A D characters not traced right?
You really should check those.
Oh right.
Erm.
which report bar's that the Con one?
Hang on a minute!
Er type the or moor the er con.
I did n't see eighty four before.
Oh, so that is n't all the problems then?
Ah!
So once you've chewed those you should run it again?
Oh I did n't realise that!
Ah!
Yeah.
Well I have n't had that problem before though.
No, I do.
No, I do, I do normally I I'm pretty careful.
The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations!
Andy says, oh we've got ta add a new buffer in here so I'm shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and.
I do n't fucking know!
How the hell am I supposed to know where he is!
He's at college today is n't he?
They do n't start till nine do they?
Wan na see something clever?
Little window up here right?
The thing about co-ordinates why?
You get a little cross in that window.
then zoom.
you can see it's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Clicked up on the C N C.
Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right?
And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm.
and you're there.
No it's.
it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it,.
you can do everything.
Yeah.
And then yo, you edit box in there.
Yeah, I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right?
And then, quickly here.
Right?
But then if I go zoom in here.
and I go into that pad, say.
and you ca n't see it cos I got all items on but.
you just get a picture of that pad there.
Yeah.
Yep!
It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now!
Yeah.
It's just a good way to mark it.
But ones like this to me, I think they're cos if you.
just lay the trace over the top of the pin it does n't come out.
Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect.
Do you?
But in terms of, in terms of actual copper, I mean it is actually when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gon na be connected.
Oh yeah!
But I mean they can be left ca n't they?
What's that?
Ha!
Sorry?

Yeah, he's er got ta look out that guy ai n't he?
Well he's stupid over everything!
And totally honest.
Yeah, I've already looked at that one it's alright Bedge.
Cor it's a lot slower when you want another network innit?
The old monster!
Oh good it's one slade one now.
Mm.
Well no you're well it's, it's a stand alone, but all your files are not.
I just did that.
See you also get the bit up there with signals in this do n't you?
And window.
Yeah.
All the pins.
Ah!
Well we have got.
erm.
about four days left to get this tested then up and running.
So that.
Right.
You done all the converting?
I started reading up on it.
You know.
Oh like getting thirty four bars to a hundred.
There should n't be that, there should n't be that big a board really should it?
Well I hope it's.
What are they, forties?
Well there's only a what.
Yeah, but you've got all your microcircuitry on there.
We're gon na have a R S fifty two, erm H D L C.
That's right.
So you got those.
At least.
I've got a box for a double euro card.
Get on doing work will you?
It should be documented.
Cos if you got in by bus this morning ai n't he?
I should do that.
You're supposed to curl it up in a, in a erm in a brush when you blow dry it you know.
Keep the perm in there.
Did you ever see me when I had mine permed?
You!
You remember when I had a perm do n't you?
I looked a cunt.
I looked a complete asshole!
You did n't see me then?
It was like it was n't as long as Bedgeys but it was really tight and really you know?
Cos his is like I dunno Sweep.
his is.
his is Sweep!
But mine.
Oh erm before I was married.
About five years ago.
Five, six years ago.
God I do n't believe it!
Bloody was as well!
No, it was, it was quite long.
No, got quite, quite a nice perm.
It's thickened it up at the front innit?
I got a photograph, I'll see if I can find it, bring it in.
No!
It's like.
You've had a perm?
A China man with a perm!
Oh Nigel used to have a perm did n't he?
Nigel.
Yeah.
When I first met him it was really curly you know, and I.
just thought it was his natural hair but.
People must er think you're a pratt!
Bloody Chine China men always have straight hair do n't they?
Oh wave, yeah.
was saying.
Have you.
photograph of it?
Brilliant!
Ha!
Ish.
Yeah, one for one end, one for the other.
Yeah what I do is, I have specified so I If I suspe the numbers are quite close I put one in there have that, and I just do reverse around and you.
can see the other one might rub off.
Norman?
Wo n't be much.
Yeah, but I wo n't say!
I got Ace up there now you know.
So you aught to be careful!
Too many windows, it'll crash!
Well I'm sure it'll be alright Bedge.
It'll be alright on the night.
Well that's alright innit?
Well I ra.
What?
You look at stat which I just ran this morning right?
My file called stat it says zero airlines.
Did you just delete that?
You did n't?
Well what's that?
Have you put a different file name in?
Just do more stat and it'll say zero.
Now more the one you just did.
No, it could n't be.
You ju erase it, it wo n't allow you to over, overwrite it.
I do, that's why, I always do.
I do stat, con and rep after I've done D L C.
You've got ta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these stubs and things!
It's like, tell us what's in the software.
Er.
Good job we ran this innit?
Put it in the box.
In there.
Well I've got confused!
Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines!
What do you mean none there?
And it has n't been pulled up on the airline?
I always have it on sig as much as poss.
It defaults the sig.
Oh my God!
So we got ta do the bloody thing again anyway!
I was n't told!
Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the.
Yeah.
That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected!
You know?
Well I had n't got through that had I?
I would have discovered once I'd been through it all.
That one's get it like that red well that number's moved.
That's a bit of alive.
Boo ber ber ber ber ber.
Blue.
Doo doo.
Yeah, I can do it.

I mean we might as well pitch it now.
Pitch those plots.
That can come right down here and then blue underneath.
Pull that one down.
It could go down one could n't it?
Mm.
It just means changing it.
Well the problem is, is that you do n't like teeing off do you?
Do n't like teeing off signals.
It's got ta be.
come off at a pin.
So.
Well I could n't.
I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a,.
I just pulled it up from that bottom.
It's alright, look.
Hang on!
Yeah but I do n't like putting kinks in!
It's horrible!
The kinks.
That straight?
That straight?
That light.
That one.
I know that one is n't!
They're gone now.
Alright!
Oh.
Got ta go!
It's got ta go!
No.
I do!
You're a cunt Bedge!
I think head everyday!
It's alright!
I'm getting the poxy bloody grid!
I why do I have to work with that grid?
Oh!
No, it's all naughty and.
horrible!
I believe you!
What the hell did that jump across there for?
Ah.
my God!
That's awful is n't it?
Ah!
That's gone, right!
Let's just do board delete that'll probably help wo n't it?
Okay, so I'm coming from here.
Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right.
I'm glad to hear it!
God!
Run you over!
I'll get it sorted and I will do it again!
Cor, I dunno!
Clever boy!
Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes.
Got my charger.
I'm into model aeroplanes, yes.
Well, not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it.
When I er when I get the time.
I'll have to.
take.
Yeah.
Well the trouble is they're so small now are n't they?
Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now.
Do n't have a lot of time to think, You know!
Bloody!
But.
Oh God!
Must of.
cost him a fortune!
Probably cost him twice the amount!
To hire a plane than the thing's worth!
I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up!
Farmers are n't happy!
Aha.
Where's that bloody kettle?
Have n't we.
He's just gone.
to get it.
Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying.
Tremendous you know!
I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid.
I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and.
took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me, had no control over the thing, like!
And it er I think.
I think the engine cut at about.
Is he?
I'm a man myself, ha?
Erm yeah er e, I could n't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this?
Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it.
And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it.
And we went round this estate ca n't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se, ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca, called them over and said oh I heard that his, his.
So I got it back.
And it was n't broken!
I was.
absolutely flabbergasted!
Could of been indeed.
Drink?
Is there still the news about carrying here?
You got ta take a pay cut then?
Well, it's a bit risky for security as well is n't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The trouble is with high interest account you ca n't get the money out very quickly can you?
You ca n't get the money out very quickly.
Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out.
So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem.
Oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types.
And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties.
Yeah.
I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty?
Useless!
Yeah.
Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine.
Who's getting the other one then?
Mm.
Well he ca n't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that.
needs fast processing time.
Frank said to you you can have.
cos you need it for your work!
Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine!
How's that then?
Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six.
Cor God!
That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine!
Well there's no point!
Mm.
Yeah, well you have n't got it yet anyway have you so.
Can you stick in that box?
But the thing is, they look so different.
Do n't they?
And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it.
Completely different, re-designed box and everything.
You still using that monitor?
Ay?
So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha?
Oh right.
Mm.
Is this V G A or E G A?
Is it?
Oh!
Oh yeah.
Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine.
Right!
I better get the out then.
Ow!
It'll rebo.
That will, wi tha tha will rebo soft.
Well if it ca n't, it ca n't.
Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they?
Mm.
Mm.
We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen.
You only get on go at it as well.
I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose.
A tape?
Oh that's messy!
Yeah.
Okay.
The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right?
Is one six one and this is it's ha!
You're hoping!
It's not going into anything is it?
Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right?
So that's gon na be a bit small, but.
we're not gon na have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really ca n't we?
The depth is erm.
four one.
That will take us is it clear up.
to there, to here.
Yeah, okay.
Well what we can do.
is put in a connector, you know those connectors?
That these fellers are on?
You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can.
cut the pillars those there.
Cos that is like a sixth of the area is n't it?
Mhm.
Yeah, so basically.
Yeah, like, yeah?
Yeah!
What an insult!
He's not that old are you?
